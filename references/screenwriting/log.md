I want to write a screenplay that's set in a zombie apocalypse and involves regular teenagers in irregular circumstances. I like the idea of having it be stylistically low budget like a documentary-style.

I also like the idea of setting it many years after the zombie apocalypse started, and humanity has sort of made peace with its existence with zombies.

I don't want it to be about the zombies really, or saving the world. I want to write about characters who have their own lives and goals and that to try and survive in a post apocalypse.

I want it to be really realistic and well-researched. How would people actually live and survive with this?

I'm intrigued with things that are going to stay the same. Like there's still going to be drug addiction right so people will set up shop with all kinds of things. These little stories.
