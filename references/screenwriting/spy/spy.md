I want to write a mystery / puzzle screenplay. This is the premise:

A group of the highest-level spy recruits in Australia participate in a competition without knowing.

They don't know about eachother, but they are each tasked with missions that contradict eachother. The idea being only one of the spies can win. I want the rules or the make up of the game to be brilliantly simple and contained.
