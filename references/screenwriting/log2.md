I want to write a screenplay. They say write what you know, but I'm pretty young and don't have a lot of experience in life. I like research, and for this reason I'd like to write about something that I can read about really deeply about and create adaptations.

Most importantly I want to write about something that involves characters that are super smart and aspirational. They can be flawed, but I want to write characters that embody lessons and an approach to life. I want to be in situations where I can write lines that are really brilliantly written.

Info about me:
- 20 years old
- Australian, born an raised.

prompt me for input about myself and what I should be writing about here. help me by prompting me through a progression without making it too hard to do all at once on my own. give me several exhaustive potential options for each to inspire me.
