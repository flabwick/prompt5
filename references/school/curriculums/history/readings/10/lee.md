The China Boom 
China's economic growth, urbanisation and industrialisation were the mainstay of the third and most dramatic of the resource booms during Australia's second great minerals rush. The China boom spanned the decade from about 2002 until 2012, when prices of Australia's mineral exports began to fall. It followed the Japanese-driven minerals boom from the early 1960s to 1973 and the resources boom from 1977 to 1982. Of the three booms during the second minerals rush, the China boom was the most significant, largely because of the breadth and intensity of China's demand for Australia's mineral resources in the 2000s: the boom almost doubled the value of Australian mining exports and mining's share of nominal GDP in Australia.1 Mining amounted to nine per cent of GDP in 2003-04 and 18 per cent in 2011-12 in terms of dollar values; and in real terms the China boom added three per cent to Australia's GDP in those years.2 
The China boom that began in the early part of the 2000s was greatly intensified by the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-08. China responded to the worldwide economic crisis that developed in 2007 and 2008 with a massive stimulus package that transformed an upswing in Australia's mining sector into what some believed to be a "commodity super cycle" that would last for decades.3 The heights that the Australian mining sector reached during the China boom can be appreciated by the fact that mineral and fuel products accounted for 68 per cent of merchandise exports in 2009. Not since the gold rush of the nineteenth century had minerals figured so prominently in Australia's export profile. The leading mineral exports were iron ore, metallurgical black coal, refined gold, crude

oil and related products, thermal black coal, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Measured as a percentage of total Australian exports of goods and services, in 2009 minerals and fuels accounted for 55 per cent, services for 19 per cent, manufacturing for 11 per cent and rural products for a mere 10 per cent.4 
A phase of economic growth and industrialisation in China in the 2000s drove the Australian resources boom in the same way as Japan's "economic miracle" underpinned the minerals boom and the industrialisation of Northeast Asian economies such as Taiwan and South Korea supplemented a faltering Japanese economy in the 1980s and 1990s. A common attribute of Taiwan, South Korea and Japan was that their economies were complementary to Australia's. They were all abundant in labour and poor in resources, while Australia had a rich endowment of minerals necessary for the industrialisation of East Asia. China was different because it had its own reserves of minerals and particularly coal and iron ore, two of the main commodities in Australia's second minerals rush. Indeed, until 2000 China was better known to the rest of the world as an exporter rather than an importer of mineral commodities. In the 2000s, however, after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), China increasingly sourced imports of iron ore and coal and other mineral commodities from Australia. 
This process propelled China into becoming Australia's largest trading partner, and iron ore into the position of Australia's top single export earner. During the China boom iron ore also became a barometer of Australia's economic success in the same way that wool had been in the first half of the twentieth century. From the mid-2000s, Australia's economic wellbeing would become more closely tied with China than it had been with Japan from the 1960s to the 1980s. In the period before the China boom, some had seen Australia's dependence on minerals exports as a serious weakness. During the China boom many looked at minerals in a different light - as an endowment that was helping to make Australian living standards higher than those of Americans, Canadians, the British

and most Europeans. The last time that Australians had managed such a feat was during the nineteenth-century gold rush." 
In the boom conditions of the first decade of the twenty-first century, mining companies considered that they would be in a favourable position for a generation. With this frame of mind they sought to obtain the best possible prices for iron ore and hence to move trade away from stable but lower-priced long-term contracts to the higher prices available in the spot market. On the buyers' side, Chinese steel companies, worried by increasingly high resource prices, pushed strongly to take controlling interests in mining assets abroad. In the process they stirred nationalist sentiments in Australia and elsewhere. The actions of buyers and sellers militated against a sense of partnership between Australia and China in the development of Australia's iron ore, a partnership that the Hawke government had established with the opening of the Channar mine in the 1980s. 
Once the China boom ended in 2012, with the waning of this sense of partnership, Chinese steel companies drove a hard bargain on iron ore prices. During the China boom, Australian mining companies and governments hoped that the good times would last for years and that Chinese steel production would exceed one billion tonnes per year - just as in the early 1970s mining companies had hoped that Japanese steel production would exceed 150 million tonnes per year. It did not happen with Japan in the 1980s and 1990s and it would not happen with China after 2012. The "commodities super cycle" turned out to be an aberration created by the Chinese fiscal stimulus during the GFC feeding directly into state-owned and other heavy industries. From about 2012 China reverted to a long-term strategy with seven per cent growth as the desirable goal, a balancing of exports and domestic consumption, and a rebalancing of heavy, light and services industries. This change in the pattern of Chinese economic growth after 2012 saw an end to the Australian resources boom and harder times for key Australian mining sectors, particularly iron ore and coal. The iron ore industry faced ruthless price-cutting and the coal

industry, a high emitter of carbon, was particularly exposed to the world's response to the challenge of climate change. 
China's Economic Transformation and Australia 
China's modern economic transformation began in 1978 with the emergence of Deng Xiaoping as paramount leader. After establishing diplomatic relations with the United States in 1979, Deng began opening the Chinese economy to the world. He liberalised the agricultural sector, began to import technology, encouraged foreign direct investment and foreign trade and established special economic zones in some coastal provinces.' After joining the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1980, China became the largest recipient of aid from both global institutions. By the late 1980s Deng's reforms had led to the expansion of light industry, the development of stock markets and the diversification of the banking sector. Deng also decentralised state-owned trading corporations and manufacturing corporations so that they were able to manage their own export and import policies within the context of the government's goals. 
In the first decade of Deng's reforms between 1979 and 1989, China's trade increased tenfold in absolute terms and more than doubled as a percentage of GNP from 11.4 per cent to 26.3 per cent. China exported Its agricultural products, textiles and light industrial goods in those years. top three markets were Hong Kong (still at that time a British Crown Colony), Japan and the United States. Between 1978 and 1999 China's cent.9 By 2000 the market economy GDP grew at an annual rate of 9.5 per had won out over the socialist economy in China. Historian Odd Arne Westad argues that "[f[[or China's population it was clear that they were living in a new society in which market forces were dominant". 10 China' post-Mao transformation into a capitalist economy was as significant a development for Australia as had been the Chinese Communist defeat of the Nationalists in 1949.

the Japanese to look to countries like Australia rather than China for their raw materials, in so doing driving the twentieth-century stage of Australia's second minerals rush. China's late twentieth-century embrace of capitalism would take Australia's second mineral rush to its pinnacle in the first decade of the twenty-first century. 
Despite China's economic development in the last two decades of the twentieth century, few were predicting that Chinese demand would spark another resources boom in Australia at the beginning of the twenty-first century. When the Reserve Bank of Australia held its annual conference in 2000, there was not a single mention of China while the United States, which was then Australia's top two-way trading partner, was mentioned 93 times. China at that time ranked only sixth of Australia's export markets, behind Japan, the United States, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. Australian exports to China, at around $4 billion, were less than one quarter of exports to Japan and half of exports to the United States." In 2000 Japan was importing 125 million tonnes of iron ore compared with China's 70 million tonnes.12 Having lost the mantle of Australia's top two- way trading partner in 1996-97, Japan would regain it from the United States between 2003-04 and 2006-07.13 
At the turn of the new century, the Australian economy was recovering from the East Asian economic crisis of 1997-98, which had particularly affected Indonesia and South Korea, and from the worldwide downturn precipitated by the bursting of the US technology (dot.com) bubble. At that time, Japan was still the biggest purchaser of coal and iron ore and was in the middle of its third technical recession in a decade. In previous downturns, such as at the end of the resources boom in the early 1980s, the effect on Australia was that the prices of its rural and mineral commodities plunged while those of its imported manufactured goods held firm. The exact reverse occurred in the first decade of the twenty- first century. This was largely due to China's entry into a new phase of economic development. It was to be one of the most extraordinary phases of economic growth in world history. When Britain started to industrialise 
340 
THE SECOND RUSH 
in 1780, it took more than half a century to double British GDP per head. Such a doubling took Japan 34 years and South Korea 11 years, starting in 1966. By comparison, China doubled its GDP per head every eight years in the 1980s and 1990s and every seven years in the 2000s.14 
In December 2001, China finally succeeded in gaining entry into the WTO after 15 years of trying. To achieve this goal China had made substantial concessions to the United States on tariffs, agricultural subsidies, intellectual property rights and reform of the banking sector.15 China's WTO membership was advantageous to a policy it had launched in 2000 called "going global", the goal of which was to transform Chinese businesses into transnational enterprises. Registering some of China's largest firms on the Hong Kong and New York stock exchanges raised billions of dollars for Chinese companies to acquire or merge with foreign holdings. 16 
China soon surpassed Japan as the third-largest trading economy after the European Union (EU) and the United States. Then, in the 
years 
between 2004 and 2007, China doubled the size of its exports and overtook the United States as the world's largest exporter. In doing so, China became the workshop of the world, producing electronic goods, domestic appliances, automobile components and textiles." By the first decade of the twenty-first century China had developed the world's largest reserves of foreign exchange and was one of the biggest recipients of foreign direct investment. China's energy consumption surpassed that of the European Union in 2004 and that of the United States in 2006.18 In 2007 China was responsible for more than 10 per cent of the growth of the world economy."

China's rapid economic growth generated, in turn, a deep thirst for resources. Between 2000 and 2010 China's use of copper trebled, steel output increased fourfold and production of aluminium increased ever more rapidly.20 Chinese usage of electricity, powered by both hydro- electricity and coal, also surged.

export growth. A Chinese White Paper on mineral resources noted in 2003 that there was "a fairly large gap between the supply and demand in oil, high-grade iron, high-grade copper, fine quality bauxite ... We shall open still wider to the outside world".21 In 1998 China was a modest consumer of minerals and metals, accounting for 10 per cent of global consumption of minerals and metals. By 2008 it was consuming between one quarter and one third of minerals and metals and nearly one half of industrial metals.22 Indeed, from 1998 to 2013 China accounted for all the global growth in commodities such as copper, nickel, seaborne iron ore and coal. As economist David Humphreys has argued, this "represented a degree of dominance in minerals use unmatched since the early 1950s when the United States similarly dominated world markets" 23 
When Deng Xiaoping became leader of China, its urban population had stood at around 18 per cent of the total population. After China accelerated its industrial production and exports in the 2000s, increasing numbers of Chinese moved from the countryside to the cities so that by 2013 urban Chinese represented half of the total population of more than one billion people.24 China's increasing focus on exports spurred industrialisation in the east and south of the country, particularly in Guangdong, and along the Yangtze River Delta in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai. Constructing urban housing and infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, office buildings and sewerage systems created a huge demand for steel. To encroach as little as possible on agricultural land, Chinese buildings became increasingly taller, greatly increasing their use of steel.25 Until 2000 light manufacturing underpinned China's growth. Up to the turn of the century, steel production had risen at the modest rate of 7.5 per cent per year, adding between six and nine million tonnes to world steel production annually. But in 2001, as China's cities and urban infrastructure developed, steel production increased by 23 million tonnes. In 2002, 30 million tonnes were added and in 2005 75 million extra tonnes of steel were produced.? 
26 
China's own reserves of iron ore were of lower grade and located 
342 
THE SECOND RUSH 
far away from the steel-producing centres on its eastern seaboard. Consequently, China's steel industry began to turn its attention to Australia and other suppliers for iron ore and coal. China had evolved from importing only three per cent of its iron ore consumption in 1981 to more than half by 2003.27 The increase in Chinese imports of iron ore after 2003 was even more dramatic for Australia. In 2000 China imported 70 million tonnes of iron ore. This represented 15 per cent of the global market for seaborne iron ore.28 But over the course of the next decade China totally transformed the seaborne iron ore market. By 2013 China was importing more than 800 million tonnes of iron ore, 65 per cent of global trade in that commodity.29 Australia's iron ore exports to China were valued at $1.2 billion in 2000-01. In 2005 China overtook Japan as the top buyer of Australian iron ore, and by 2013 Australian iron ore exports to China were estimated at $57 billion out of total Australian iron ore exports amounting to $75 billion.30 Iron ore became Australia's main single export during the China boom just as coal had been Australia's main single export for most of the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, when the China boom was beginning, iron ore exports were worth half of coal exports. By 2012, exports of iron ore were worth one fifth more than coal exports.31 From 2006-07 onwards China was Australia's top two-way trading partner.32 
A similar phenomenon occurred with bauxite and alumina. Despite lacking alumina, China became the world's largest producer of aluminium metal in the first decade of the twenty-first century. By using low-cost hydro-electricity, China was producing 22 million tonnes of aluminium metal, or 46 per cent of global output, in 2013. From importing less than two million tonnes of alumina in 2000, China was sourcing seven million tonnes, or half its requirements of alumina, from abroad in 2005. Though China had substantial reserves of bauxite, it was not the kind suitable for producing alumina. From that year, China also began to import bauxite for processing into alumina in China. Starting at two million tonnes in 2005, China was importing 70 million tonnes of bauxite in 2013.33 While Chinese purchases of Australian bauxite amounted to nearly nothing in

2004, by 2007 China was Australia's top customer for that mineral. By that time Australia was the world's leading producer of bauxite and alumina and the world's fifth-largest aluminium producer. In 2008 Australia mined about 31 per cent of the world's bauxite and produced 33 per cent of its alumina and eight per cent of its aluminium metal. 
China had been largely self-sufficient in coal, was ranked as the world's largest coal producer and was an exporter of coal into the 2000s. But by 2009 China had become a significant net importer of thermal and coking coal. The Australian coal industry benefited from this shift since Australian black coal had the advantage that it was low in sulphur. China's imports of coal from Australia rose from a modest four million tonnes a year in 2007 to 47 million tonnes in 2009. This was nearly one fifth of Australia's coal exports and made China second only to Japan as an importer of Australian coal.34 China was, however, a lesser destination than Japan for Australian exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). These exports increased from $2.2 billion in 2003-04 to $16.3 billion in 2013-14 when Japan continued to take the majority of Australian LNG exports by volume and value.35 The North West Shelf project was an important part of Australia's second great minerals rush examined in this book. LNG projects that are being developed at the time of writing in 2016 have the potential to make Australia the largest world exporter of LNG. Starting with Woodside's $15 billion Pluto project in 2007, nine new LNG projects were approved across northern Australia, including Chevron's Gorgon project on Western Australia's Barrow Island. These investments give Australia the potential to become the world's largest exporter of LNG. But these developments are beyond the scope of The Second Rush and the focus of the concluding chapter is the China boom from 2002 to 2012. 
50 
In the year 2000, Australian trade with China overall increased by per cent, followed by another 25 per cent leap in 2001. With exports almost trebling in the five years up to 2004, China became Australia's second-ranked market.36 After the end of the China boom in 2013, Australia was the largest producer of iron ore in the world with 32 per cent 
344 
THE SECOND RUSH 
of global production as opposed to Brazil's 19 per cent; the largest producer of bauxite with 29 per cent of global production to Indonesia's 19 per cent; the second-largest producer of gold with 9 per cent of global production to China's 14 per cent; and the fifth-largest producer of coal with five per cent of global production. Australia was also the fifth-largest producer of copper and the fourth-largest producer of nickel.37 
Towards the end of the China boom, Paul Cleary wrote: 
The mining boom that got underway in the middle of the last decade has already made us the richest citizens in Australian history. The extra increase amounts to about 15 per cent of our economy, or about $190 billion each year. It is as though we inherited the entire economy of New Zealand in one fell swoop.3 
38 
The boom vastly increased Australians' buying power, measured as the ratio of export prices to import prices, the terms of trade.39 While real GDP per capita increased by 12 per cent between 2002 and 2010, real gross domestic income per capita increased by 22 per cent. This was because the China boom significantly added to Australian incomes even though this was not fully reflected in conventional measures of GDP.40 The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, illustrated the point graphically in a speech delivered in 2010. Stevens noted that: 
five years ago, a ship load of iron ore was worth about the same as about 2,200 flat screen television sets. Today it is worth about 22,000 flat-screen TV sets - partly due to TV prices falling but more due to the price of iron ore rising by a factor of six. 
At the end of the China boom, the World Bank estimated that average incomes in Australia were one third higher than American incomes. The last period in which average incomes in Australia were higher than in America was the golden age of the second half of the nineteenth century.4 
42 
41 
Federal and State governments reaped significantly higher revenue from the boom. In 2003-04 the mining industry paid net company tax of $2.8 billion; in 2008-09 it paid $13.4 billion. The consequent increase in Australia's budget surpluses up to 2007-08 was in the view of John Edwards, "not very far short of the rise in company tax from mining in

the period 2003-04 to 2007-08".43 The gift of additional revenue from the mining boom between 2003 and 2007 provided the means for the Howard government to lower personal income tax rates, extend superannuation concessions and increase spending on social transfers.44 But as the Australian Treasury got used to the revenues from the mining boom, it then began to over-estimate mining revenues from the Global Financial Crisis onward, thereby compounding Australia's budgetary problems as it fought to ward off a recession.45 The high prices engendered by the Chinese fiscal stimulus disguised Australia's budgetary problem in the period up to 2012. After the end of the boom, as the budget moved into deficit, a major challenge for Australian governments was to restore the federal budget to balance following the tax cuts made in the early years of the commodity price upswing."

same time as the 
The China boom commenced at about the BHP with multinational mining company, Billiton, in 2001. By the 1990s merger of BHP was already a global mining company, one third of whose assets were held outside Australia. Before the boom started, BHP had an interest in Escondida, one of the biggest copper mines in Chile, and another at Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea, oil prospecting concessions in Vietnam and Indonesia, coal mines in Indonesia and the United States, a gold mine in West Africa and exploration ventures in diverse countries.47 BHP's merger with Billiton was the culmination of a process of consolidation of major mining companies that had been underway in the world mining industry throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. In 2000, for example, Alcoa acquired Reynolds Metals and in 2004 Alcan completed a $5-billion takeover of the French company Pechiney. Alcan would itself soon be merged into a new mega-company, Rio Tinto Alcan.48 
There were several factors at work in this consolidation. One was the generally poor performance of companies whose operations were based on a single commodity. A second was that larger and more diversified mining companies were better able to cope with the increasing cost and complexity of large-scale resource projects. A third factor was the 
346 
THE SECOND RUSH 
emergence of mining managers who were motivated to achieve shareholder value rather than remaining attached to particular assets. The rationale for the merger of BHP with Billiton was BHP's fear of becoming a marginal player in the world mining industry." Another of BHP's motivations was to take advantage of China's economic transformation. Billiton was a leading producer of aluminium as well as the world's biggest producer of chrome and manganese alloys, with operations in Australasia, Africa and South America.50 
The new company, BHP Billiton, was a diversified mining company, listed on both the London and Australian stock exchanges, with a market capitalisation of $60 billion. BHP's shareholders controlled about 58 per cent of the equity and Billiton's 42 per cent. The merged company instantly became the world's second-biggest mining and metals group after the American company Alcoa, and the largest mining company within a few years. The consolidation that was at work in the mining industry was exemplified by the fact that in 1990 the top five mining and metals companies made up less than one quarter of the world mining industry's total equity value of $US150 billion. BHP, the largest of those companies. then had a market capitalisation of around $US9 billion. But in 2009 the top five companies accounted for almost half of the resource equity of $US250 billion. BHP Billiton remained the largest company but was four times as large as BHP had been in 1990.51 
A few years later, BHP Billiton made another important acquisition that would help equip it to respond to the China boom. WMC Resources (formerly Western Mining Corporation) was by this time the world's third largest nickel producer, supplying eight per cent of global demand, and was the owner of the prized asset Olympic Dam.52 In 2004 Olympic Dam was producing 225,000 tonnes of copper, 400 tonnes of uranium and almos 90,000 ounces of gold. WMC Resources itself was earning tidy profits of $515 million in the first half of 2002. Nonetheless, the chief executive of WMC, Andrew Michelmore, was well aware that his company was susceptible to a takeover. It was a price-taker (or uninfluential in affecting

In 2004 newly formed Swiss-based multinational Xstrata made an offer to purchase WMC at $6.45 per share – thus valuing the company at $7.4 billion. WMC felt that Xstrata's offer undervalued the company. On 24 November Michelmore reinforced the point when he gave notice that the mineral reserves at Olympic Dam were nearly 30 per cent per cent higher than previously thought. By this new reckoning, Olympic Dam had the world's fourth-largest remaining copper and gold resources. Although Xstrata would raise its bid to $8.4 billion, BHP Billiton trumped its rival on 8 March 2005 by announcing a bid of $9.2 billion for the Australian company. The purchase of WMC Resources brought to BHP Billiton the world's largest mineral deposit, Olympic Dam, just as one of the world's biggest resources booms was beginning, 53 
The Expansion of the Iron Ore Industry in the Pilbara 
Three companies, Vale, BHP and Rio Tinto, accounted for more than two-thirds of iron ore exports to Northeast Asia at the beginning of the twenty-first century. On the consumers' side, five companies dominated Japan's steel industry and one dominated South Korea's. The Chinese steel industry was less concentrated. At the turn of the twenty-first century it was divided into three tiers. The bottom tier consisted of several thousand small-scale enterprises using antiquated technology and accounting for about 15 per cent of China's steel production. A second tier consisted of around 70 medium sized "key enterprises". This second tier contributed about half of Chinese output, but its members were technologically deficient when compared with leading steel companies in other countries. Then there was a top tier of ten "national champion" firms that had achieved the technological standards of other top world steel-makers but accounted for only one third of national production. Even the "national champion" steel companies were comparatively small by international standards, at only one third the size of world-leading steel companies. 55

of tha 
Until 2000 the lack of international competitiveness of the Chinese steel industry had not been regarded as a problem because the Chinese government was able to protect it from international competition. But after China's accession to the WTO in 2001, the government had to scale back protection for, and subsidies of, its steel industry. During the 1980s the Chinese steel industry had been self-sufficient in steelmaking raw materials with its own coal and iron ore. But, while large in volume, China's iron ore deposits were low in grade. The result was that the cost in raw materials of Chinese steel was high by world standards in the 1990s. By the turn of the century, an iron ore crisis had developed in China. To feed the Chinese steel boom, mining of Chinese iron ore increased. But because of its high cost, Chinese steel companies increasingly shifted their purchases to overseas iron ore suppliers, including such countries as Australia to which the Chinese had begun directing foreign investment. Chinese imports of iron ore rose from 70 million tonnes per annum in 2000 to 628 million tonnes per annum in 2009.56 
The Chinese position in the world iron ore market differed from Japan's in another way. Japanese companies had formed many joint ventures with Australian and South American mining companies from the early 1970s. China, by contrast, had relatively fewer at the start of the twenty- first century, notwithstanding its pioneering partnership with Hamersle Iron at Channar. Nor did the Chinese mills have the same capacity as 
in annua the Japanese steel companies to function as an organised group price negotiations. Despite the Chinese steel industry's growing size, the Japanese steel mills maintained leadership of annual iron ore "benchmark negotiations on long-term iron ore contracts for much of the first decade of the twenty-first century. 
At first the major Pilbara producers were slow to respond to the onset of the China boom. In 2000 and 2001 BHP was consummating its merger with Billiton and also dealing with the adverse effect on the world economy

At the end of that year, however, the company established its biggest network office in Shanghai.57 In 2002 BHP Billiton's sales to China were $US742 million. They rose to $US1.2 billion in 2003 and then to $US1.1 billion in the first half of 2004 alone. In March of 2004, BHP Billiton Chief Executive, Chip Goodyear, initiated the kind of deal with Chinese steel mills that BHP had been pursuing with Japanese companies in the last three decades of the twentieth century. Goodyear locked four Chinese steel mills -- Wuhan Iron and Steel, Maanshan Iron and Steel, Jiangsu Shagang group and Tangshan Iron and Steel - into a long-term iron ore contract worth $US9 billion over 25 years in return for Chinese equity in a new mining operation. The four mills each took 10 per cent of the Jimblebar mine (formerly McCamey's Monster), east of Mount Newman.58 
BHP Billiton's Board also took the decision to invest $US213 million to expand the production of its iron ore mines and an additional $US351 million to enhance its port and rail facilities. By the end of 2004, BHP Billiton's total sales to China were $US2.4 billion. China was making up one tenth of BHP Billiton's total sales and accounting for more than one fifth of its sales growth." For five consecutive years up to 2006, BHP Billiton broke the records for the highest six-monthly net profits for an Australian company. 
The acceleration in Chinese demand for iron ore in the first half of the 2000s gave iron ore producers unprecedented market power in negotiations as global supply struggled to keep pace with demand. Iron ore mining companies had a very strong hand in annual price negotiations and, feeling that this strong position would last for a generation, sought to reap the maximum profits from Chinese steel companies."1 Following on a nine per cent rise in 2003, prices rose by almost 17 per cent in 2004 before an unprecedented increase of more than 70 per cent agreed in 2005 between Vale and Nippon Steel. 62 China considered this last price increase catastrophic. The Chinese steel industry criticised the deal as one settled by Japanese firms whose declining market share meant that they were now 
350 
THE SECOND RUSH 
incapable of negotiating for the North East Asian industry as a whole. In response to a sharp fall in the profitability of Chinese steel triggered by higher iron ore prices, the Chinese government issued a new steel policy in 2005. Its first component was to develop new iron ore suppliers, principally by encouraging Chinese steel firms to invest in iron ore projects overseas with the assistance of the state-owned banking system. Australia's relative proximity to China made it a natural target for Chinese investment. By investing in Australian iron ore, China hoped to achieve direct control over a substantial proportion of its imported iron ore. In 2011 the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) stated that it hoped to increase the share of imports from China-invested operations in Australia from 10 per cent to between 40 and 50 per cent over a period of five to ten years.63 The second component was to foster better coordination between Chinese steel companies with the goal of improving the Chinese position in annual price negotiations. So between 2006 and 2009 the Chinese government took action to limit the number of Chinese companies allowed to import iron ore and to place restrictions on each company's allowed imports.64 The objective of these measures was to try to lower iron ore prices on long-term contracts by reducing the competition among Chinese iron ore importers. 
But the Chinese government's efforts were hampered by market forces and the actions of the buyers and sellers. While the top 10 Chinese steel mills continued to purchase iron ore under long-term contracts from Australian and Brazilian mining companies, the smaller Chinese companies bred a vibrant spot market in which the short-term price rose as much as 40 percent above the long-term contract price level. By 2005 almost half of Chinese iron ore imports were being made through spot purchases. 65 The Chinese government and the steel industry did not welcome this development The increasing tendency of the big mining companies in Australia to take advantage of higher spot prices led to complaints from Chinese industry and from the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, who called in April 2006 for iron ore contracts to be placed in the hands of governments.

THE CHINA BOOM 
351 
Early in 2006 the Chinese government announced that in future leading Chinese steel firm Baosteel would settle iron ore prices on behalf of Asian steelmakers. In the 2007 annual contract negotiations, Vale had seized the position of leading iron ore negotiations from Rio Tinto. The Brazilian miner settled on a price rise of only 9.5 per cent of the price achieved in the previous year. This left the Australian miners deeply dissatisfied. When Vale in February 2008 again settled on a price rise of 65 per cent, well below the 140 per cent rise requested by the two Australian firms, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton refused to follow."7 Rio Tinto contended that prices for iron ore were double those which Vale had agreed and notified spot its intention to sell a further 15 million tonnes on the 
spot market. 
Rio Tinto's decision greatly upset the Chinese steel industry. The Chinese Iron and Steel Association (CISA) complained that Rio Tinto was deliberately under-filling long-term contracts by claiming force majeure and then supplying additional tonnages on the spot market. Indeed CISA interpreted Rio Tinto's use of the spot market to achieve more than the price reached with Vale as a "breach of a long-standing rule of the market, according to which everyone agreed to the price of the first settlement".69 Consequently, CISA upped the ante by threatening that Chinese steel enterprises would boycott any mining companies that switched from long- term contracts to spot prices. Baosteel's negotiator, Ding Shouhu, indicated to Rio Tinto executives that China was prepared to cut its steel production by 50 million tonnes a year to enforce a boycott of Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton ships. In the end, however, these threats were not carried out and the Chinese steel companies reached a compromise with the iron ore miners. They agreed at the end of 2008 on a record-breaking increase for the iron ore producers of 96.5 per cent in lump ore and 79 per cent for iron ore fines. This worked out at a weighted average rise of 85 per cent for Rio Tinto and a little less for BHP Billiton." 
CISA tried to put a brave face on the outcome by commenting that the deal with Rio Tinto at least preserved the system of long-term contracts and annual price negotiations. This was not the view of new 
352 
THE SECOND RUSH 
BHP Billiton chief executive, Marius Kloppers. Kloppers wanted to help create a new system in which iron ore producers negotiated long- term contracts that fixed quantities exported but that also allowed prices to be adjusted quarterly on the basis of the spot price prevailing in the previous quarter." A breakthrough for Kloppers came in 2009 when Chinese steel companies failed to reach an agreement with the major iron ore producers. Consequently the iron ore companies concluded an agreement with Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese steel companies on prices for their 2009-10 contracts, much to the consternation of Chinese steel companies, which were holding out for lower prices. A sign of the high stakes in these negotiations was that China arrested four Shanghai- based Rio Tinto executives, charging them with stealing secret Chinese information valuable for the iron ore negotiations." Although the ensuing negotiations with Chinese mills were inconclusive, large Chinese steel companies increasingly took advantage of spot market prices, which had begun to fall as a result of the global financial crisis. By 2009 spot market pricing accounted for 60 per cent of the global iron ore trade.74 
In these circumstances, the Chinese steel industry was forced to accept quarterly index pricing along the lines advocated by Marius Kloppers, thus ending a system of "benchmark" pricing that had been in place since 1973. Under the new pricing regime, the regional price of iron ore continued to rise, reaching $US170 per tonne in mid-2011. The China boom had thus transformed the global iron ore trading system, a system that Australian producers dominated during that period." Initially the Chinese had hoped to use the old system of long-term contracts and annual price negotiations to exercise market power in favour of lower prices. This did not happen. The emergence of large numbers of smaller Chinese steel producers and the actions of the large mining companies pushed the system in precisel the opposite direction. The new system of index pricing reduced the power of the Chinese steelmakers and was more advantageous to Australian mining firms during boom conditions."

saw the Chinese steel companies have no compunction in driving down the price of iron ore to levels that threatened to put some Australian companies out of business. Kloppers' win in 2009 turned out to be a pyrrhic victory. In the long term the iron ore companies had forfeited the protection offered by long-term contracts and stable prices. At the end of the boom, the big mining companies, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, saw their salvation in expanding production to maintain their market share against higher-cost producers both in Australia and elsewhere.78 State and federal governments also faced a mammoth task in adjusting to the falling away of revenue from mining generated during the boom. 
The Rise of Twiggy Forrest and Fortescue Metals 
The China boom saw the entry of new players in the Pilbara to supplement the production of the iron ore duopoly, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. They included Hancock Prospecting, owned by Gina Rinehart, the daughter of Lang Hancock who had died in 1992, FerrAus, Aquila Resources, BC Iron, Brockman Iron and Atlas Iron. The most remarkable of the new iron ore companies was Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest's Fortescue Metals, a company formed in 2003. Forrest's great-great uncle was Western Australia's first premier, Sir John Forrest, who had presided over the State's first gold mining boom in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries." 
Like his famous forbear, Andrew Forrest pursued grand dreams and was prepared to take huge risks to realise them. As a young boy he overcame the affliction of stuttering through the mentoring of Ian Black, the son of "Scotty" Black, an Aboriginal. Forrest, like Hugh Morgan, held strong Christian beliefs that led him in later life to support the cause of ending slavery. He was a generous donor to charitable causes and to Australia's leading university, the University of Western Australia. Like Rio Tinto's Leon Davis, Forrest was a staunch advocate of employing Aboriginal people in the mining industry. He developed into mining from stockbroking in the 1990s when he set out to develop large nickel 
354 
THE SECOND Rush 
fields in Western Australia but was forced to back out when costs became prohibitive.80 Undeterred, Forrest decided in 2003 to move into the iron ore business by establishing Fortescue Metals. The obstacles in Forrest's 
way 
were formidable. The barriers to entry in the iron ore trade were so high that it was estimated to cost in excess of $3 billion to finance the infrastructure needed to become a viable producer.1 In 2004 Fortescue's market value was $60 million compared with the more than $100 billion combined worth of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.82 But the China boom and Forrest's imagination and tenacity enabled Fortescue Metals to overcome these huge obstacles. 
By the 2000s the large Pilbara iron ore deposits that could be identified relatively easily, such as Mount Tom Price, Mount Newman and Jimblebar, had already been found. The conventional wisdom until the China boom was that potential iron ore bodies in the Pilbara ended close to any surface outcrop. Consequently, the rate of iron ore discoveries had declined since the 1960s and 1970s. For several decades the iron ore majors had held leases over areas that remained undeveloped in the Chichester Ranges. After years exploring these areas, BHP and Rio Tinto both reached the conclusion that the Chichester Ranges had insufficient ore to warrant the infrastructure required for mining. Forrest, however, had the confidence that he would be able to find ore where others had failed. Spurred on b his foresight about the strength of Chinese demand for Australian iron ore, he acquired leases that the majors had discarded in 2004 and 2005 Rio Tinto acquiesced in letting Forrest try to develop the leases, perhaps relying on its ability to buy them back if serious reserves were proved an on the knowledge that Fortescue Metals would have to build a port and rail system to develop them.8

Forrest's geologists counted on the fact that major deposits of iron ore, though not visible to the eye, might yet lie below the surface. They used the "Tiger's Tail" model to look for indications where a small

geologists to discover massive quantities of ore in the Chichester Ranges. Whereas deposits such as Mount Whaleback and Mount Tom Price were like icebergs with large sections above the ground, the Chichester deposits were found to lie in vast, flat blankets stretching for tens of kilometres and yielding reserves of billions of tonnes of ore. Despite this breakthrough, however, the ore was found to be low-grade and so riddled with shale and other impurities as to be worthless. 
88 
At this point, luckily for Forrest, John Clout, a geologist regarded as one of Australia's foremost experts on iron ore, achieved a crucial breakthrough for Fortescue Metals. He identified small amounts of microplaty hematite - the same variety of ore as at Mount Tom Price and Mount Newman - in the iron ore in the Chichester Range. Clout argued to Forrest that the challenge was to find enough premium ore to blend with Fortescue's low-grade ore and justify a mine.89 This was the same kind of breakthrough that had underpinned Western Mining Corporation's unconventional thinking in the 1960s about Jarrahdale bauxite. Forrest agreed with Clout and ordered his geologists to peg and drill every inch of his leases, which by the end of 2004 covered almost 40,000 square kilometres. Forrest's biographer found that four years later, when Fortescue Metals began exporting iron ore, it had leases over 52,000 square kilometres, making it a bigger holder of iron ore tenements than either BHP Billiton or Rio Tinto.90 
Predicting early the magnitude of the iron ore trade between Australia and China, Forrest negotiated initial sales agreements with Chinese steel mills and made arrangements with Chinese engineering firms to build port and mine infrastructure. He forged alliances in 2005 with investors including the China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC), the China Railway Engineering Corporation (CRE) and the China Metallurgical Construction Group (MCC)." This deal fell over in 2006 when MCC adopted an aggressive strategy and sought a majority equity stake in Fortescue Metals. Forrest was forced to negotiate new arrangements."2 By 2006, with its exploration funds running out, Fortescue Metals required a

cash injection of $2 billion. With the aid of the American banking group Citigroup, the company performed a feat analogous to the foundation Pilbara projects of the 1960s by raising this extraordinary sum in America. At that stage there were only two owners of infrastructure in the Pilbara, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, and each had been successful in rebuffing attempts by others to use its rail network. Rio Tinto had actually been prompted to take over North Limited when the latter tried to get access to its infrastructure in 2000. 
In 2007 Fortescue Metals achieved a breakthrough when it negotiated its first iron ore sales contract with Baosteel. Fortified by this deal and having received permission from the WA government to build a berth at Port Hedland, Forrest abandoned the effort to persuade the majors to let Fortescue share rail facilities. Instead he built his own 260-kilometre railway system to Port Hedland. In May 2008 Forrest made his first commercial shipment of iron ore to China on the Heng Shan. Between then and May 2013 Fortescue Metals shipped more than 200 million tonnes of iron ore and developed the infrastructure to produce more than 155 million tonnes per year. Forrest had achieved the astonishing feat of building the fourth- largest iron ore company in the world during the China boom.

The Global Financial Crisis and the Mining Boom 
The latter stages of the China boom coincided with the GFC and the attempt by BHP Billiton to effect one of the greatest mergers in mining history, that of BHP Billiton with Rio Tinto. This initiative provoked Chinese conglomerate Chinalco to pre-empt the merger by taking an equity stake in Rio Tinto. These dramatic events occurred at the same time as the Australian government was reacting to one of the greatest economic challenges in Australia's history: preventing the global financial crisis that had begun in the United States in 2007 from precipitating depression in Australia.93

THE CHINA BOOM 
357 
Two weeks after the election of a Labor government under Kevin Rudd, in November 2007, BHP Billiton made an informal offer to take over Rio Tinto at the prevailing share prices that valued the company at $US140 billion. BHP Billiton had contemplated such a merger in the early 2000s before the acceleration of the China boom." Its rationale was that BHP Billiton had the better of the iron ore bodies in the Pilbara but that Rio Tinto, now strengthened by its absorption of Robe River, had superior infrastructure. But by 2002 what might have been the biggest merger in the history of the world mining industry had come to naught. Not deterred by the earlier failure, BHP Billiton chief Marius Kloppers revived the idea in 2007 to achieve greater economies of scale and larger operations by combining the two largest Pilbara iron ore operations, which between them were now supplying just under 40 per cent of China's iron ore needs. The merger would have created a giant company worth US$350 billion in market capitalisation. Kloppers' case for the merger was that it would deliver US$3.7 billion in annual cost savings, most of which would come from combining the operations of Hamersley Iron with BHP Billiton's seven mining operations in the Pilbara and sharing rail and port facilities. 
When Kloppers revived the plan, the Pilbara was in the midst of the greatest boom in its history and the Chinese government and industry were becoming seriously concerned about high resource prices. Liu Yikang, the China Mining Association's deputy secretary general, was aghast at the prospect of a behemoth in the Pilbara, commenting: "It's terrible. If completed, the deal between Rio and BHP would create a mining giant enjoying a monopoly in many mineral resources and a further lessening of competition, and would thus lead to hikes in iron ore prices"." The British Financial Times quoted Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao saying: "I don't know a lot of things but what I do know is that this deal is not good for me"." The high stakes involved in the merger of these two giant mining companies were highlighted by business analyst Ian Verrender, who commented: "This is not just another merger - this is a huge battle for control of vital

THE SECOND RUSH 
and scarce resources, the sort of thing that has brought countries to war in the past, and it has coincided with an uprising of Chinese nationalism”,98 The Chinese feared that a merger between BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto would lead to higher iron ore prices, which would affect Chinese steel and manufactured exports and thus endanger China's ongoing economic growth. 
BHP Billiton's manoeuver also provoked strong resistance from its long-time competitor, Rio Tinto, whose American chief executive, Tom Albanese, rejected BHP Billiton's offer of three shares for every one of Rio's shares. Albanese had just consummated a $40-billion takeover of the aluminium producer Alcan, calculating that taking over the huge debt that had resulted would deter BHP Billiton from proceeding with the Rio Tinto merger.99 
In the meantime, BHP Billiton attempted to reassure Chinese industry that a merger would not have adverse effects on China and signed up with Baosteel to export an additional 94 million tonnes of iron ore from the Pilbara. Then, on 30 January 2008, the state-owned Chinese company Chinalco joined forces with American company Alcoa in what was described as the "biggest ever dawn raid" on the London stock market. 10 Chinalco, the world's second-largest producer of alumina and fifth-largest smelter of aluminium metal, was a company that wanted to diversify into other areas of mining. It had bought Peru Copper in August 2008 and was assessing the prospects of buying other mining companies around the world. Joining forces with the American aluminium giant, it purchased a nine per cent stake in Rio Tinto for $US14.05 billion as a means of pre- empting the BHP Billiton offer. Alcoa's motive in assisting Chinalco to block BHP Billiton was to give itself advantages in the Chinese market The exercise was the largest offshore investment yet made by a Chinese company. 101 
In reaction to the Chinese move, BHP Billiton made its takeover of Rio Tinto hostile, raising the bid to 3.4 shares to one of Rio Tinto's. 102 The chair of BHP Billiton, Don Argus, justified the proposed merger to Rudd

on the grounds that companies like BHP Billiton in small countries like Australia had to grow bigger in order to compete in a globalising world. Argus argued: 
The plight of every small economy is that it has too small a home to grow champions of scale. With increased globalization and consolidation, this inevitably results in local companies being absorbed or becoming subsidiaries of multinationals. After being purchased, they quickly get hollowed out and become branch offices 
Investment choice in the local market dries up. 103 
In the following year, in February 2009, Chinalco tried to invest a further $US19.5 billion in Rio Tinto consisting of $US7.2 billion in purchases of convertible bonds and $US12.3 billion in minority equity stakes in Rio Tinto's bauxite mine in North Queensland, Hamersley Iron in Western Australia and some of Rio Tinto's key copper mines around the world. The proposed deal would have raised Chinalco's stake in Rio Tinto to roughly 18 per cent and entitled its executives to two seats on the board.104 Chinalco envisaged that its share of Rio Tinto's output would be marketed by a joint venture, which would allow the Chinese company to gain knowledge of the workings of the iron ore industry and the way that producers priced iron ore. This prospect aroused the same kinds of fears that had arisen in the 1970s and 1980s about Japanese companies taking equity positions in Australian mining operations to gain an insight into their pricing. 
Continuing with its own campaign for Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton argued strongly to the Rudd government that the proposed Chinalco deal with Rio Tinto "will have the clear effect, and is intended to have the effect, of substantially reducing the prices paid by the Chinese steel mills for iron ore, particularly that produced in Australia". BHP Billiton further advised: 
If the transaction was approved in its current form, it would result in effective control over Rio Tinto passing to Chinalco and, as a State Owned Enterprise, to the Chinese government. Rio Tinto would likely be the foundation of a powerful China Mining Company. This

THE SECOND Rush 
would irrevocably change the face of the global natural resources industry - it would see a major competitor operating on an unlevel playing field with their portfolio based on Australian assets. 105 
Peter Drysdale, an economist at the Australian National University, argued the exact opposite case - that the deal, if successful, would have brought about "the first great Anglo-Australian-Chinese mining and metals company, probably headquartered in Australia. This company would have been positioned to play a lead role in the Chinese market" 10 
But the BHP Billiton criticisms of the proposed Chinalco investment in Rio Tinto found a sympathetic response from the Liberal-National coalition Opposition.107 Trade unionists such as Paul Howes, national secretary of the Australian Workers Union, also opposed the acquisition. By April 2009 it had also become clear that Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), the advisory board established in 1976 under the Foreign Acquisition and Takeovers Act, was taking an active interest in the Chinalco case. The FIRB was required to review all foreign acquisitions of Australian assets worth more than $A100 million, evaluating them for their consistency with the national interest. In April 2009 the FIRB ruled that it would be anti-competitive for Chinalco to buy into Rio Tinto's aluminium operations given that the company was already China's biggest aluminium producer. The FIRB ultimately informed Chinalco that the deal was "too big and too complex" 108 
While Chinalco's further investment in Rio Tinto was thwarted by the FIRB, it was the GFC that stopped BHP Billiton's attempted takeover of Rio Tinto. The crisis had begun in the United States in the second half of 2007. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the following year, bank lending in advanced economies, which had fuelled consumption and helped China's export growth, was curtailed and global GDP shrank for the first time since the end of World War II. The Chinese economy had. become dependent on exports in the boom years and these shrank by one third between the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009.109 China's response to the world economic crisis was to introduce in November 2008

a four trillion renminbi ($US586 billion) stimulus program. Amounting to 14 per cent of GDP, this made the Chinese stimulus package the largest of any country relative to the size of its economy.110 The package was directed to public investment in transport, rural infrastructure and public housing. The effects were remarkable with industrial production rebounding in 2009 as public investment filled the void left by the slowdown in exports and manufacturing. 
With the resurgence of the Chinese economy came a spurt in its demand for mineral commodities overseas. While some were predicting the end of the China boom in Australia in the wake of the GFC, this did not happen. Rather, Chinese reaction to the GFC prolonged and heightened the boom in Australia. After its recovery in 2009 the Chinese economy grew by 10.3 per cent in 2010 and 9.3 per cent in 2011. The comparison with other G7 countries is striking. While industrial production in these countries was six per cent below its level in 2007, China's industrial production doubled over the same period. In 2009 China surpassed Japan as the largest producer of cars in the world and in 2014 was assessed by the World Bank to have the largest economy in the world."" 
The huge Chinese fiscal stimulus was the key to what was being called a "commodities super cycle". 112 The thinking behind the concept was that emerging economies such as China, Brazil and India were growing faster than advanced economies and that the world was on the threshold of a number of decades of material intensive growth.113 Those who thought in these terms, however, were mistaken about long-term Chinese policy and the effects of the GFC on this policy. The Chinese government had always expected that in the normal course of events China would revert in the second half of the 2000s to a long-term sustainable growth rate of around seven per cent per annum and that it would shift to a more domestically driven economy with a strong emphasis on developing western and central China. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08 and China's fiscal response to it delayed this measured shift from export-led and investment-led growth to domestically led growth by half a decade 
362 
THE SECOND RUSH 
and in the process fuelled investment and oversupply by resources and energy companies in Australia. The reckoning for Australia, when the Chinese stimulus ran its course, would be harsh. 
At the start of the China boom, royalties from iron ore to the State of Western Australia were less than $300 million. By 2013-14 iron ore royalties exceeded $5.3 billion and accounted for more than one fifth of the Western Australian government's own-source revenue. Federal coffers also received a windfall gain from higher company tax. The mistake made by Australian governments was to misunderstand the nature of the commodity cycle and assume that the higher taxes and royalties would perpetuate a super cycle for a generation. They adjusted their spending in line with these flawed assessments. At the height of the boom the Australian government also made an effort to raise higher federal taxation from mining. In 2010 the Rudd government took the radical initiative of announcing it would impose a Resource Super Profits Tax (RSPT) – a 40 per cent tax on mining "super profits", triggered when a company's profits exceeded $75 million. A vigorous public relations and advertising campaign by the Minerals Council of Australia, the successor of the Australian Mining Industry Council, and mining companies proved to be one of most successful in Australian history. The campaign dominated the airwaves in May and June 2010 and inflicted such huge political damage on the Rudd government that even some mining workers sided with their employers over the Labor government. The smaller miners participated along with the big miners. Forrest and Gina Rinehart, boosted by the China boom to become Australia's richest woman, addressed a boisterous crowd in Perth on 9 June. Rinehart led the crowd in chanting slogans such as "axe the tax". The public campaign played a large role in the ALP party-room defeat of the generally popular first-term Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who was ousted as prime minister by a caucus vote on 24 June. Rudd's successor, Julia Gillard, renegotiated the tax as a Mineral Resource Rent Tax. However, because of design flaws and the end of the resources boom, this tax failed to raise significant revenue, and the Abbott government abolished it after the 2013 election.11

THE CHINA BOOM 
363 
The China Coal Rush Although iron ore exports surpassed those of coal during the China boom, coal was either Australia's top export commodity or second-biggest export commodity during that boom. The China boom in Australia centred on the expansion of both coal and iron ore. As with iron ore, the pressure on coal prices in the 1990s had seen the Australian coal industry become more concentrated in ownership. By the early 2000s, four companies were producing about three quarters of saleable coal output in Australia. The hopes of these companies for better times were realised in the China boom when the price of coal began to rise at about the same time as that of iron ore. 
The rise in coal prices was almost as spectacular as those of iron ore. Between 2003 and 2012 the price of thermal coal more than quadrupled, from around $US25 per tonne to well over $US100.115 Over the 10 years of the China boom from 2002 to 2012 the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics reported that Australia's production of saleable black coal increased by 46 per cent to reach 401.4 million tonnes in 2012-13. Whereas Australia had been exporting 120 million tonnes of coal in 1991, by 2012 coal exports had more than doubled to 316 million tonnes. 116 At the height of the China boom, the coal industry earned around $48 billion in exports, employed around 46,000 people and attracted huge investment.117 In the Hunter Valley and Newcastle regions alone, coal production increased by 33 per cent to 141 million tonnes, yielding 105 million tonnes of saleable coal. 118 Newcastle was by now the biggest coal port in the world, servicing the Hunter region, which contained most of the 60 coal mines and produced more than 70 per cent of NSW output.119 The Global Financial Crisis did not slow down the coal boom and indeed this was the period in which China increased its purchases of Australian coal. By 2011 ten new coal projects were in progress and another 14 in the pipeline. Six and five railway expansions were also underway in an industry whose new port spending was $55 billion in 2010-11 and $73.7 billion in 2011-12.120 
Australia's coal output increased because of rising demand from Asian 
364 
THE SECOND RUSH 
countries other than China in the first part of the boom and then as a result of increasing demand from China itself. In the latter stages of the China boom, from about 2008-09 to 2012-13, coal accounted, on average, for about 15 per cent of Australia's total exports of goods and services and was in itself equal to or greater than Australia's agricultural exports. The economist Sinclair Davidson estimated that the "coal economy" that is, coal mining and related services and industries amounted to 3.1 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product in 2011-12. He further calculated that the "broader coal economy", defined as the output of the coal economy plus the spending of wages earned in the coal economy - represented 4.2 per cent of GDP or almost $60 billion in 2011-12, the same size as iron ore and agriculture (at the farm gate).121 
During the China boom Australia's coal producers were dominated by two companies that had been mining coal during the minerals boom, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, and three multinational companies that had entered or re-entered the Australian coal industry in the 1990s and 2000s. Anglo American Corporation, Peabody, and Xstrata (later GlencoreXstrata and then Glencore). Between them, the big five companies accounted for production of about 250 million tonnes of coal annually at the height of the boom. 122 
In combination with Mitsubishi, BHP Billiton was Australia's largest coal producer, contributing more than one quarter of Australia's annual coal exports and about 28 per cent of the world's seaborne trade in metallurgical coal. The BHP Mitsubishi Alliance was the successor to Central Queensland Coal Associates, the combination between Utah and Mitsubishi that had developed during the minerals and resources booms. During the China boom, the BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance operated seven mines in the Bowen Basin through the Hay Point Terminal- Goonyella Riverside, Broadmeadow, Daunia, Peak Downs, Saraji, Crinum, Blackwater and Caval Ridge. With Mitsui, BHP Billiton operated two other Bowen Basin mines, the South Walker Mine and Poitrel Mine. BHP Billiton also mined thermal coal at Mount Arthur in the largest individual

Rio Tinto operated five mines in Australia during the China boom. Hail Creek was an operation that had first been mooted during the minerals boom in the early 1970s but only began operations under Rio Tinto in 2003. Rio Tinto's other Bowen Basin mine was the Kestrel mine that Rio Tinto had purchased from Atlantic Richfield in 1999. Rio Tinto operated an open-cut mine at Bengalla, four kilometres south of Muswellbrook, which commenced operations in 1999; it operated the Hunter Valley operations of Coal and Allied Industries, the management of which Rio Tinto had assumed when it took over Coal and Allied in the late 1980s; and it ran the Warkworth thermal and soft coking coal mines, which had first begun operating under R.W. Miller and Coal and Allied Industries in 1981. 
Peabody had first come to Australia in a consortium with Thiess Bros and Mitsui in the 1960s. In 2000, Irl Engelhardt, the chairman and chief executive officer, floated Peabody as a public company to generate the capital to fund new ventures, including an expansion into China and into more coal-fired power generation in America.124 After its flotation, Peabody Energy became the largest coal mining company in the world. 125 In New South Wales during the China boom, Peabody Energy operated the Metropolitan mine 30 kilometres north of Wollongong, the Wambo mine 30 kilometres west of Singleton in the Hunter Valley and the Wilpinjong mine 40 kilometres north of Mudgee. It also operated six mines in the Bowen Basin in Queensland. Anglo American Corporation, which was the dominant force in coal mining in South Africa, began mining coal in Australia from about 2000.126 During the China boom, it operated Capcoal in the German Creek formation in a joint venture with Mitsui to supply coal for export to steel markets. The area had first been developed during the resources boom. Anglo American had also acquired the Callide open- cut thermal coal mine, mainly supplying coal for power generation in Queensland, and the Drayton open-cut thermal coal mine in the Hunter Valley, a mine originally developed by CSR during the resources boom. 
366 
THE SECOND RUSH 
In 2001 Xstrata, a small company with its headquarters in Switzerland, persuaded Glencore, the Swiss trading and mining company that owned 40 per cent of Xstrata, to allow the coal assets of its subsidiary, Enex, to be passed to Xstrata. 127 Xstrata thereby assumed the management of the Bulga mine in the Hunter Valley, a mine originally started by BHP as Saxonvale during the resources boom. Xstrata successfully listed on the London Stock Exchange in March 2002. From a tiny company of about 17 people working from the basement of J.P. Morgan's offices near Blackfriars Bridge in London, Xstrata would become a $US40 billion company during the China boom.128 In 2003 it paid almost $3 billion to acquire the coal and other assets of its Australian rival, MIM Holdings, thereby turning itself into the world's largest exporter of thermal coal.129 But in 2005, as we have seen, Xstrata was beaten by BHP Billiton in its efforts to take over WMC Resources (formerly Western Mining Corporation),130 In 2007 Xstrata acquired the Anvil Coal Mine (later Mangoola) in the Upper Hunter Valley from Centennial coal. 131 Five years later, at a time when Xstrata was making one third of its sales to China, it opened its first office on mainland China in Shanghai. In July 2012 Xstrata was taken over by Glencore, a company that itself had taken over the operations of petroleum and minerals trader Marc Rich.132 Xstrata subsequently traded as Glencore. 
Besides the big five coal companies there were about a dozen medium- sized companies Centennial Coal, Yancoal, Wesfarmers, Ensham, Whitehaven, New Hope, QCoal, and Jellinbah Resources, which together 
accounted for about 70 million tonnes of coal. The coal rush of the 2000s produced a number of millionaire coal barons. One of the most colourful was Nathan Tinkler, a coalmining electrician born in Inverell in Northern New South Wales in 1976. In 2007 Tinkler went heavily into debt to purchase a Middlemount coal deposit for $30 million. He later sold it to Macarthur Coal for $275 million in cash and shares and came out as a 10 per cent shareholder in the company. Macarthur's share value doubled before Tinkler sold out of it in 2008 for $441 million. With the proceeds, Tinkler's company, Aston Resources, purchased the Maules Creek deposit

In 2011, when Tinkler's personal wealth was valued at over $2 billion, his company merged with a nearby company, Whitehaven, and Tinkler subsequently launched a takeover bid for the merged company. But Tinkler's fortunes rose and fell with the China boom. When coal prices started falling, Tinkler's net worth shrank precipitately.133 
Climate Change and Mining 
In the 2000s, at the same time as Australia's resources industries were booming, some of them were coming under increasing criticism for contributing to the warming of the earth's temperature. The link between industrialisation, which began in Western Europe in the late eighteenth century, and changes to the earth's climate began to be subject to heated debate in the 1960s and 1970s.134 Scientific research ascertained that, from about 1800, when the world began burning fossil fuels, the level of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere increased from 280 parts per million to 380 parts per million. In the twentieth century, the period of the greatest burning of fossil fuels, the average temperature of the earth's surface rose by approximately 0.6 degrees Celsius. 135 A major source of increased greenhouse gas emissions is the world's increased population, which has trebled since 1950, and its rising incomes. World GDP has also trebled since 1950, and with increased incomes came increased usage of energy and hence emission of greenhouse gases.136 
In 1988 a group of scientists met in Geneva to inaugurate the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 137 The IPCC drew its legitimacy from two international organisations: the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Development Program. Through conferences, papers, and dialogue, the IPCC set out to understand the world's climate. 138 In October 1990, it reported to the United Nations that 
368 
THE SECOND RUSH 
the earth was definitely warming but that it would take another decade or so to determine whether this warming was essentially man-made or a product of the natural variability of climate.139 The IPCC later predicted warming in the twenty-first century in the range from 1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius by 2100.140 An increase at the upper end of this range was predicted to have catastrophic effects such as severe droughts and rapidly rising sea 
levels. 
In response to the first report of the IPCC, the United Nations General Assembly called for an international agreement to limit greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide. The making of the convention would be by the Earth Summit: a United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The conference reached agreement in April of that year to a common goal: "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system". Five years later, in 1997, the Japanese city Kyoto hosted an international meeting to reach an agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The conference agreed that participating nations would reduce their output of greenhouse gases emissions by between six and eight per cent below 1990 levels by the years from 2008 to 2012.142 The United States agreed to a seven per cent reduction, the European Union to eight per cent, Japan to six per cent and twenty other nations to five per cent.143 Developing countries such as China and India were allowed to increase their greenhouse emissions without limit. Australia's delegation at the Kyoto climate conference secured agreement for an eight per cent increase in greenhouse gas emissions over 1990 levels on the grounds that its resource-intensive economy demanded a special concession.144 
After the Kyoto conference, energy and industry groups mounted such an effective campaign against the agreement that the United States Senate refused to ratify the agreement. One of the principal explanations of the US stance on the Kyoto Agreement was that it did not apply to the developing world. The Howard government in Australia also refused to

ratify the agreement in sympathy with the American stance. The Australian government argued that the Australian economy was growing faster than the OECD average and that its population was increasing at a faster rate than other developed countries. Consequently, Australia argued that the task of reducing emissions to a historical benchmark was greater than for comparable developed countries like France or the United Kingdom. The Howard government did, however, agree to establish a Mandatory Renewable Energy Target as a by-product of its Kyoto negotiations. It came into operation in 2000 and required power generators to supply two per cent of their generation from renewable energy sources. 145 
The challenge of reducing greenhouse gases generally was made all the more difficult by the fact that consumption of electricity was growing worldwide.146 About 75 per cent of Australia's electricity is generated from coal-fired plants.147 The country now has 23 coal-fired power stations, which together contribute about one-third of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.148 Australian coal exports, moreover, constituted about one third of the world's seaborne coal trade, as Australian coal continued to feed the power plants and steel mills of an industrialising Asia. Throughout the world 40 per cent of electricity is still generated from coal. 
From just before the China boom to the present, environmental concerns over the link between climate change and carbon dioxide has emerged as a critical question for the future of Australia's resources-based economy and particularly the mining industry, which has been central to Australia's economic growth since the 1960s. Yet hydrocarbons natural gas and coal-provide more than 80 per cent of the world's energy oil, 
use.149 And some predict that between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of world 
energy will still be carbon-based in two decades time. 
— 
The mining industry under most challenge from the global movement to reduce global greenhouse emissions is the coal industry because it is the largest single source of greenhouse gases in the world.150 In contrast to other fuels, like oil and natural gas, coal has the advantage of being cheap and plentiful worldwide. There are still an estimated one trillion tonnes of 
370 
THE SECOND Rush 
recoverable coal, which is by far the largest reserve of fossil fuel left on the planet. 151 
One proposed technological solution to the link between coal usage and climate change was carbon capture and sequestration (or storage), better known by the shorthand CCS. The idea was to keep carbon out of the atmosphere by capturing it and burying it underground. In July 2005 six countries - the United States, China, India, Australia, South Korea and Japan - agreed to the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. It aimed to accelerate the deployment of new, more efficient power-generating plants in China and India.152 The proposed system for CCS would, however, be expensive and complex. In the view of energy historian Daniel Yergin it would be like: 
[c]reating a parallel universe, a new energy industry, but one that works in reverse. Instead of extracting resources from the ground, transporting and transforming them, the "Big Carbon" industry would nab the spent resource of CO2 before it gets into the atmosphere, and transform and transport it, and eventually put it back into the ground. This would truly be a round-trip.

In 2007, in response to growing community concerns about climate change, the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, announced that he was amenable to establishing an emissions trading scheme. He established a Prime Ministerial Task Force on the subject that included representatives from BHP Billiton and Xstrata to advise him. The press release announcing the group referred to the "possession of large reserves of fossil fuels; as one of Australia's major comparative advantages" that had to be preserved.154 The Howard government was defeated before it could implement the advice to establish a carbon market. After being elected the Rudd Labor government ratified the Kyoto Protocol and in 2009 expanded the Renewable Energy Target to 20 per cent. Then the Gillard government successfully implemented a carbon-pricing scheme in July 2012 at the end of the China boom, although this scheme was repealed two years later under a new conservative government. Since the China boom, significant international efforts have been made to develop

a new legal framework to "shape the transition to a new system of energy and the market" 155 Australia's two leading minerals industries in the second rush, iron ore and coal, have both been adversely affected by the slowing down of Chinese economic growth. Adding to the uncertainty in the coal industry is how a new system of energy use established to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions might affect the coal industry and therefore, by implication, also iron ore. This uncertainty and falling prices mean that financial institutions have become increasingly reluctant to invest in large new ventures such as Adani's Carmichael thermal project in the Galilee Basin in northern Queensland. While some have gone as far as predicting the end of the coal era, at least as it applies to thermal coal, others argue for the continued importance of coal in the global energy mix and hence of the coal industry in Australia.156 
Conclusion 
The China boom was the biggest boom in Australia's twentieth and twenty- first century minerals rush, the second rush. The China boom increased the wealth of Australians and filled the coffers of State and federal Treasuries. Some policy-makers and mining industry strategists saw the China boom as a "commodities super cycle" that would last for decades. This was not to be. When Kevin Rudd briefly returned to office as Prime Minister in 2013, he announced that "[t]he China resources boom is over" and that a "huge adjustment was required".157 In the wake of the boom, economist Bob Gregory predicted that Australians were facing "the largest negative macro shock to Australian living standards since the 1930s depression" as prices returned to their pre-boom levels. 158 From a peak of $191 per tonne in February 2011 the price of Australian iron ore had fallen to $43 per ronne in November 2015. 
The surge of Chinese growth from 2005 to 2011 was not the start of a sustainable long-term trend but a unique historical period in which China sought to establish itself as the workshop of the world. When the

THE SECOND RUSH 
its 
Global Financial Crisis threatened the Chinese economy, government 
announced a stimulus package in 2008 that intensified the boom and kept it going for another half a decade. But when the stimulus ran its course, not only did the rate of Chinese growth slow but also there was a rebalancing of the Chinese economy away from exports and investment towards domestic demand and consumption that resulted in a "less material-intensive" form of growth. 159 The end of the China boom thus requires a bigger adjustment than those required by the failure of Japanese steel production to reach 150 million tonnes in the 1970s and the recession of 1982-83 that ended the resources boom. This is because the mining industry and mining exports were much bigger comparatively than during earlier phases of the second minerals rush in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to the end of the China boom, the mining industries, and particularly Australia's coal industry, face a longer term challenge of adjustment as the world addresses the problem of climate change.
