Australian Fabian Essay
Keynesians in the recovery by the Hon Wayne Swan MP,  
Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer 
Two and a half years ago the fall of Lehman Brothers triggered  
the global financial crisis and stock market collapse that pushed  
the world economy to the brink of utter catastrophe. Australia’s  
swift policy response saved tens of thousands of jobs, countless  
business failures, and a level of individual misery and hardship  
that can never be known. Today, despite the hammer blows of  
recent natural disasters, our economic outlook is strong and we  
are in a better position than almost any of our peers.  
This second term Labor Government faces a very different set of chal 
lenges than we did for much of our first term. With private demand  
strengthening, unemployment falling and our economy pushing  
towards capacity, we need to restrain public spending, and stay the  
course back to budget surpluses. Just as it was the right thing to step  
in and support demand during the GFC, the right thing to do is to take  
a step back as private activity recovers. That’s why, since we first put  
together the stimulus package, I have adopted this motto: if we are go 
ing to be Keynesians in the downturn, we have to be Keynesians on the  
way up again. That means a speedy return to surplus. 
As I travel around the country, I’m often asked why our commitment  
to rapidly return the budget to surplus is so important. In this essay  
I want to explain how one of the 20th Century’s great thinkers, John  
Maynard Keynes, helped us find the answer, in the process influencing  
the Government’s response to both the global downturn and our strat 
egy for the recovery. More broadly, I want to describe how economic  
policy informs the delivery of not just responsible management but  
a modern progressive agenda. Most importantly, I want to make the  
point that being a Keynesian means supporting a counter-cyclical fis 
cal policy with government making room for the private sector when  
economic growth is strong.

In the 80 years since the onset of  the Great Depression, Keynes’ be lief that government has a role to  
play in avoiding recessions and  ensuring prosperity and prog ress has become Labor’s economic  compass, helping us set a course  through turbulent seas. His  direct influence has waxed and  waned, and in places been rightly  superseded by the insights of oth er economic thinkers, but when  recessions and depressions have  hit, Keynes’ broad prescriptions  have come to the fore – and they  have done so in a way that has  maintained the essential social democratic nature of Australian  society. Like Keynes, Labor is  guided by the understanding  that recessions can and do have  long-lasting costs through the  destruction of jobs and small  businesses and the erosion of  capital. 
When Labor returned to power  in 2007, more than 11 years in  opposition had filled our parlia mentary party with big plans for  
economic reform. Our aim was  to build on the achievements of  the Hawke and Keating Govern 
ments, but with new emphases on  human capital investment, envi ronmental sustainability, infra structure development and social  inclusion. It was to be a modern  incarnation of Labor’s social democratic vision, designed to  maximise the advantage from the  shift of world economic gravity  to our region and ensure the ben efits were enjoyed by more of our  people. Australia, it seemed, was  on the cusp of perhaps the most  significant burst of prosperity in  its history, and our vision was to  make that prosperity economical ly, socially and environmentally  sustainable. 
This time of anticipation paral leled another moment in La bor’s history. In October 1929,  the Government of Jim Scullin  was elected with plans to de 
liver greater prosperity to every  Australian after five years of  economic stagnation. But just  two days after the swearing in  of the new Labor ministry, those  hopes were dashed when a Wall  Street collapse plunged an unpre pared world into economic chaos.  Within 12 months, Australian  GDP had dropped by 10 per cent  and real private consumption  expenditure by 20 per cent. Two  years after that, our unemploy ment rate hit 19¾ per cent – one  of the highest rates in the world  at the time.1 
As I have recounted before, the  memory of the Scullin Govern ment’s failure weighed heavily  
upon us as we gathered around  the Cabinet table to face an  equally daunting situation in the  final months of 2008. We were de termined that history would not  repeat itself. Guided by Keynes  and other outstanding econo mists, our Government was able  to draw upon the lessons of what  went wrong in 1929 and in other  recessions since. And as Members  of Parliament and former advis ers to the Hawke and Keating  Governments, we also had the  confidence that we could win this  economic battle; at no stage were  we over-awed by the circumstanc es we faced.

Keynes and Australia 
The influence of Keynes on  Australia has long interested  Australian economic histori ans, including Professor Don  Markwell, currently at Oxford  University, and more recently  Dr Alex Millmow of the Univer sity of Ballarat, whose accounts  of the Keynesian revolution in  Australia I have drawn on for my  basic historical narrative here.2 Australia has also of course pro duced some of the most influen tial Keynesian economists of the  post-war years, including Profes sor Geoffrey Harcourt, who spent  much of his working life in Cam bridge and played a role in the  development of Labor’s economic  platform in the 1970s and ’80s. 
It was the Great Depression that  first brought Keynes to the wide spread attention of policy makers  in Australia. As Markwell points  out, the Scullin Government’s  response to the crisis came down  to a choice of three alternatives:  the so-called Premiers’ Plan that  advocated a deflationary policy  through cuts to wages and public  spending, and increased state  taxes; the Lang Plan that sought  to suspend overseas debt obliga tions; or the moderate expansion ary policies advocated by Scullin’s  Treasurer E.G. (‘Red Ted’) Theo dore.

Theodore explicitly justified his  position by reference to Keynes’  early theories of fiscal expansion.  But while Keynes had made his  debut on the Australian public  policy stage, there was as yet an  insufficiently broad understand ing of the benefits of fiscal expan sion in times of recession. As the  history books record, the Pre miers’ Plan was the one eventu ally adopted after much debate. It  contributed to a reduction of real  aggregate government expendi ture of 9 per cent at the height  of the depression, and economic  historians agree that by reduc ing demand when private sec tor spending was in retreat, the  Premiers’ Plan made the situation  worse.3 It also led to the split of  the Parliamentary Labor Party  and the destruction of the Scullin  Government.  
Australia – and in fact almost the  entire world – was not yet ready  to put aside the conservative, de flationary economic orthodoxies  of the past. In their contributions  to the debate at this time both  John Curtin and Ben Chifley, who  were to adopt Keynes as their  economic guiding light when  Labor returned to office in the  1940s, recognised that it would  take a decade for the world’s  financial system to catch up with  the realities of the global econo my.4 They were right. 
The Scullin Government, ham strung by a conservative major ity in the Senate and crippled  after the resignation of Theodore,  lacked the capacity to implement  practical, expansionary policies  in the face of the Great Depres sion. Labor’s plans to create a  more social-democratic society  ran aground. If the party was to  ever implement its hopes for

the nation, it had to become a  successful economic manager of  capitalism, and if it was to main tain the political unity necessary  for holding on to government in  the good times and bad, it had to  find a practical economic policy  consistent with its social-demo cratic platform. It needed to be  intellectually prepared to handle  economic crisis without dividing  and collapsing. Keynes helped  provide the solution. 
During the 1930s a number of  people who were subsequently  to become Australia’s leading  economic thinkers travelled  to Cambridge to participate in  what was becoming a full-blown  Keynesian revolution. These  included the likes of L.F. Giblin  and Colin Clark, who are credited  with significant contributions  to the evolution of Keynesian  theory. These men were to have a  profound effect on the economic  evolution of our nation.  
One of those responsible for the  adoption of Keynesian thinking  – who actually studied at the Lon don School of Economics (then  the home of anti-Keynesians like  Friedrick von Hayek), but who  was by inclination Keynesian –  was a man whose name is well known to historians, H.C. ‘Nug get’ Coombs. 
Returning from England,  Coombs’ brilliance brought him  to the attention of the leading  politicians and bureaucrats of  the day. He worked as an advisor  in the Commonwealth Bank and  the Treasury, before being given  the posts of Director of Ration ing, Director-General of Post-War  Reconstruction, and Governor of  the Reserve Bank. Through hold ing these powerful and important  offices, through his closeness to  successive prime ministers, and  through the policies he pursued  so vigorously, Coombs helped put  Keynes’ stamp on the make-up of  
modern Australia perhaps more  than any other single person. 
Those in doubt about the effect  of Keynesianism on Coombs and  others of his generation need  look no further than the open ing sentence of his memoir Trial  balance: issues of my working  life: “The publication in 1936 of  Keynes’ General Theory of Em ployment, Interest and Money,  was for me and for many of my  generation the most seminal  intellectual event of our time.”  And soon, Coombs admitted, he  “had become convinced that in  the Keynesian analysis lay the  key to the comprehension of the  economic system.” 
Professional economists and  public servants were not the  only ones to be captured by the  Keynesian revolution that was  gathering pace in the world’s eco nomic centres. Keynesianism was  beginning to influence deeply the  thinking of Labor’s leading politi cal figures, including the man  who more than any other would  direct the economic dimension of  Australia’s wartime and post-war  evolution, Ben Chifley.  
As Chifley’s first biographer  L.F. Crisp (himself a convinced  Keynesian) points out, Chifley’s  membership of the Banking  Royal Commission coincided with  the release of Keynes’ General  Theory, which had a major im pact on the Royal Commission’s  findings. Those findings neatly  sum-up the central economic  policy prescription at the heart  of Keynesianism: the expansion  of public works and government  expenditure in times of depres sion to revive private enterprise  and employment; and contracting  public expenditure and reducing  debt once growth and prosperity  have been restored. 
In other words, Chifley along  with the most influential pub-

www.fabian.org.au 3 

lic servant of his day, Nugget  Coombs, was present at the  creation of the policy that was to  guide the emergence of Australia  as a 20th Century social-demo cratic state: demand management  in pursuit of full employment  and rising prosperity through  balanced budgets over the eco nomic cycle.  
The Keynesian revolution in  Australian economic policy had  begun, and was to be put into  effect through the Curtin and  Chifley Governments’ war-time  economic management (which  drew heavily on Keynes’ influ ential work, How to pay for the  war), their post-war reconstruc tion policies, and, internationally,  through their participation in the  Bretton Woods Agreement (where  Australia’s representatives were  sometimes more Keynesian than  Keynes himself). That was anoth er lesson Labor picked up – that  recovery from, and prevention of,  recession demanded Australia act  on the world stage. 
This Keynesianism was to remain  a feature not only of Labor eco nomic policy, but of all Austra lian governments until the end of  the Keynesian consensus during  the 1970s. While obviously not  everything was perfect, it helped  produced three decades of largely  full employment and mostly low  inflation before eventually bog ging down in a combination of  rising unemployment and persis tent inflation during the Whit lam era – problems which beset  governments of all shades across  the world in the aftermath of the  first OPEC oil shock.5 This gen eralised prosperity was a mighty  achievement. It relied on national  economic consensus, but it was

begun by Labor, and remains a  crucial and proud era in our na tion’s and our party’s history. 
Revolutions of course have a way  of turning full circle, and the  problems that confronted Keynes ian economic managers from the  early 1970s onwards led to the  rise of new economic theories.  Labor’s economic thinkers wisely  accepted the need for change.  The Hawke Government began  with a moderately pro-Keynesian  program, then followed an eco nomic reform route which placed  greater emphasis on boosting  competitiveness and productivity  through economic liberalisation  and controlling inflation through  a mixture of sustained fiscal con solidation, tight monetary policy  and incomes policy.  
This alternation of economic  liberalisation, tight fiscal policy,  and Keynesian demand man agement in times of downturn  illustrates an important feature  of Labor’s modern economic ap proach: our policies are based  on an understanding of contem porary conditions and practical  solutions, not on a dogmatic  adherence to economic ideologies.  Experience is our guide.  
As I have argued here, the great  crash of 1929 led to dramatic  improvements in economic policy,  financial regulation and, after  World War II, the creation of a  social safety net that provided the  developed world with the base on  which it built decades of eco nomic stability. And the economic  crises of the 1970s – like the Brit ish Winter of Discontent and the  global oil shocks, stagflation and  unemployment – led to reforms to  unclog the arteries of a sclerotic  capitalism, freeing up economies  and contributing hugely to rising  living standards in the follow ing decades. We learned from  both lessons, and Australia is far  richer for it.  
Labor’s policies are also based  on the absolute need for fiscal  responsibility. In short – and in  contrast to our opponents – we  understand that economic policy  must bend to the needs of the  times, not the other way around.  What this meant was that when  the GFC hit, Labor was fully pre pared to adopt a pragmatic view  about what policy course to take.  We understood the implications  of the crisis, our Labor values  dictated that we must act, and  Keynes provided the framework  for that action. We didn’t act  because it was politically expedi ent to do so, we acted the way we  did because it was right – right  by our values and right for the  economy. 
Keynesianism had given the ALP  four valuable assets with which  to confront economic crises: a  practical, progressive economic  policy; a psychology that reces sions were no time for surrender  and could be tackled by policy; an  openness to ideas based on practi cal utility; and the makings of a  short and long-term plan for re covery. Each of these four assets  were to prove invaluable during  the global recession.  
Keynes and the Global  Financial Crisis 
It’s easy for politically and  ideologically motivated critics to  downplay the threat presented by  the GFC. From the comparative  comfort of our strong economy,  it’s tempting to forget that Aus tralia was not immune to the big gest worldwide recession since  the Great Depression itself. 
In 2008 the world grappled with  a synchronised downturn un like anything we had seen in 75  years. The banking system was  under threat, asset prices dived,  global trade plummeted, firms  stopped producing, households 

4 www.fabian.org.au 

stopped spending, investment  almost dried up, and business  confidence took a blow from  which it is still recovering. In the  first few months alone, financial  firms worldwide recorded more  than US$1.1 trillion in losses and  write-downs. Wealth was de stroyed on an unimagined scale.  Sixty million people lost their  jobs. One after the other, the de veloped world economies tumbled  into deep recession. All up, an nualised global GDP collapsed  by 6.25 per cent in the December  2008 quarter – the sharpest fall  in global output on record. For a  time, the GFC wreaked economic  havoc on a grand scale, and its  effects are still hurting the devel oped world. We continue to see  high rates of entrenched unem ployment in the United States  and Europe, and lingering con cerns in countries with imposing  fiscal mountains to climb. 
It is too easy to forget just how  exposed Australia was to the cri sis. Eight out of ten of our major  trading partners went into reces sion. Our banks faced dislocated  global capital markets and calls  from bank customers flowed into  my office. The decline in produc tion, investment and exports  affected jobs, with unemployment  rising by 175,000 within months.  Our economy contracted by al most 1 per cent in the final three  months of 2008.  
This is the context in which we  decided to act. 
The comparison between what we  did and what the Scullin Govern ment did is of course informed  by improvements in the policy le vers at our disposal. We were not  hampered by the gold standard,  by the lack of access to inter national capital that restrained  public and private borrowing  and investment, nor by a weak  central banking system. The very  things that were created as a  
response to the Great Depression  and the subsequent era – like un employment benefits, a compre hensive social security system, a  floating exchange rate and an in dependent Reserve Bank – would  act in the recovery as automatic  stabilisers.  
We were also fortunate in that,  unlike 1929, governments  around the world acted largely in  unison to guarantee their bank ing systems and stimulate their  economies through public spend ing. The emerging powerhouse  China, and also India and other  developing nations with high  demand for our exports, under stood the force of the Keynesian  argument for supporting their  economies in this time of crisis.  As a consequence they continued  to grow, and history has favour ably judged the outcomes.  
But the fact that our Govern ment was in a better position  than Scullin’s did not constitute  an argument for doing nothing.  Unarguably, had the Austra lian Government listened to our  conservative critics and done far  less, the outcome for our econo my and our nation would have  been far worse. We would have  gone into recession, hundreds  of thousands more jobs would be  gone, and many more businesses  would have closed their doors. 
Underpinning our policy re sponse were the principles of  fiscal and monetary action to  boost aggregate demand set out  by Keynes in his General Theory  and his activist publications of  the Great Depression era: imme diate stimulus measures to boost  consumer spending and confi dence; useful public works to  create employment; lower inter est rates to boost investment and  spending; and concerted inter national action to strengthen the  world financial system. 
Through this prescription,  Keynes’ first message to us would  have been to have confidence to  act and to act fast. Dithering – as  policy makers did in 1929 – only  allowed the economy to dete riorate further. Like Keynes, we  in the Government believed we  had a moral duty to act and act  decisively – hence our quick and  determined response, two factors  we were at pains to emphasise. 
Recognising that long lead times  can create a lag between the an nouncement and employment  effect of major public works,  Keynes was in favour of imme diate action to boost consumer  confidence and spending. In a  celebrated passage at the height  of the slump (referring to the  multiplier effect of consumer  spending – a discovery that lay at  the heart of his General Theory),  Keynes urged women to go out  and restock their linen cupboards  aware that by doing so they were  creating work and preventing  families from going hungry. This  general principle provided the  basis for the Government’s early  action, which the then Treasury  Secretary Ken Henry summed up  as: “go early, go hard, go house holds”. 
It is for this reason that one of  our first responses to the crisis  was the Economic Security Strat egy, which provided $10.4 billion  in targeted stimulus payments  to pensioners, carers and fami lies in December 2008, as well  as immediate training places for  the unemployed and additional  assistance to first home buyers to  stimulate housing construction. 
The other element of fiscal policy  Keynes recommended was public  works to turn idle savings into  useful investment. This con stituted the second part of the  Government’s stimulus measures.  In February 2009 the Govern ment began implementing a $42 

www.fabian.org.au 5 

billion Nation Building and Jobs  Plan to support jobs and invest  in future long-term economic  growth. It included investments  in major infrastructure such as  roads, rail, ports, freight facili ties, clean energy initiatives, the  National Broadband Network,  and school, university and hos pital infrastructure. Some $16.2  billion of this investment was for  the Building the Education Revo lution program, which funded  building and maintenance works  across nearly 24,000 projects.  
All up, public investment rose  by 25 per cent in 2009-10, which  was the largest annual increase  on record. As a result, Treasury  estimated that the stimulus and  public works measures added  2¼ per cent to the economy in  2009-10 and reduced the peak in  unemployment by 1½ percentage  points. Without these measures  our economy would have suf fered a protracted recession and  around 200,000 more Austra lians would have been put out of  work. 
The swiftness of our response –  putting stimulus into the econo my less than three months after  the collapse of Lehman Brothers  
– was a telling factor in Austra lia avoiding recession, unlike  virtually every other developed  economy. 
In the immediate Keynesian  sense, the stimulus was a great  success. But more than that, it  ensured that instead of remain ing idle, the capital invested has  added to our nation’s future eco nomic capacity, making economic  growth more economically and  environmentally sustainable and  creating more educational oppor tunities for Australian children.  It protected the skills base of  our economy and prevented tens  of thousands of workers from  becoming permanently lost from  the workforce. Our stimulus pro 
grams helped advance our vision  of a more progressive society.  
The Government was heavily  criticised for increasing national  debt by taking this course of ac tion. But there could be no other  way. The choice was spelt out in  my Budget Speech for 2009-10: Since last year’s Budget, taxa tion receipts have been revised  down by around $210 billion  over the forward estimates. This  represents around two-thirds  of the write-down in our budget  position. It is the biggest down ward revision in our history.  Roughly equivalent to the entire  Commonwealth spend on health  and hospitals over the forward  estimates. Faced with that reality,  there are two starkly different  ways to go. You can balance the  budget by dramatically pushing  up taxes and slashing and burn ing vital services in key areas  like health, leading to a deeper  and longer recession, and higher  unemployment. Or you can offset  a temporary collapse in revenue  with a program of responsible  borrowing that also provides for  the stimulus the economy needs  when private sector investment is  in retreat. This is the course the  Government has adopted. It is the  only responsible course. 
One of the reasons for the se verity and length of the Great  Depression in Australia was the  overly tight monetary policy  kept in place for so long by the  Commonwealth Bank, the cen tral bank at the time, combined  with a lack of access to loans  from overseas. This is a problem  Keynes recognised in relation to  almost all countries. In contrast,  during the GFC, our independent  Reserve Bank acted swiftly to re duce interest rates, with the cash  rate falling from 7 per cent at the  time of the crash to 3 per cent by  April 2009 – the lowest level in  many years.  
Australia’s banking system is  strong and resilient after years  of tough supervision and sound  management. But when govern ments around the world moved to  guarantee their banks’ access to  global capital markets, we moved  quickly to do the same to ensure  the continued flow of credit to  our economy. To avoid the dra matic loss of depositor confidence  we saw in countries around the  world, we also accelerated the  introduction of our Financial  Claims Scheme to protect bank  deposit accounts. These actions  helped to maintain confidence  and stability in our financial sys tem and improve access to money  markets, ultimately enabling  households to continue borrow ing and business to survive,  invest and grow.  
Another of the major lessons of  the Great Depression was that  action to stave off slumps must  be internationally coordinated. In  a global slump, internationally  coordinated fiscal action is more  powerful because each country’s  fiscal spillovers aid in the eco nomic recovery of its trading  partners. 1929 proved that gov ernments must work in concert  to promote stimulus, and that  protectionism and poor global  financial regulation made mat ters much, much worse. Keynes  devoted much of his remaining  life to addressing this central  problem by encouraging interna tional action to promote economic  stability and growth. His efforts  helped produce the Bretton Woods  Agreement that established the  IMF and the forerunner of today’s  World Bank, which are playing a  major role in the worldwide eco nomic recovery today. 
The disaster of 2008 proved that  many of Keynes’ lessons about in ternational finance in particular  
had been forgotten or deliberately  ignored. For this reason, the Aus tralian Government was a lead-

6 www.fabian.org.au 

ing voice for the coordination of  international stimulus measures,  the maintenance of free trade,  and the redesign and reconstruc tion of the world’s global finan cial architecture.  
Most importantly, we have been  a major advocate for the over haul of international economic  decision-making, in particular  by championing the G20 group  of nations as the pre-eminent  forum for international economic  cooperation. This is of course in  Australia’s interest as a middle  power member of the G20, but it  also recognises that in order to  succeed, global economic reform  must be owned by the over whelming majority of the world’s  people.  
Since the onset of the crisis  the G20, with strenuous input  from Australia, has played an  important role in coordinating  stimulus measures, broaden ing and strengthening financial  and prudential regulation, and  ensuring the needs of develop ing nations are considered in its  policies. I personally have partici pated in the G20’s major summits  in Washington, London, Pitts burgh, Toronto and Seoul, as well  as numerous other meetings of  world finance ministers. Austra lia has punched above its weight,  and I am determined that we will  continue to do so. 
Keynesianism in the  
Recovery 
Too many ideologues dismiss the  value of Keynes’ work (through  unthinking philosophical preju dice). To these people, usually as sociated with ultra-conservative  economic think tanks, Keynes ians are politically-motivated pro ponents of a bigger state, against  liberalising economic reforms,  stuck in the past, and generally  unfit for office.  
Such critics of Keynes like to see  themselves as practical economic  thinkers, not proponents of a  political and economic ideology.  The best that can be said for  them is that they are seriously  deluded. Keynes recognised the  danger of such thinking, re marking famously in the final  paragraph of the General Theo ry: “Practical men, who believe  themselves to be quite exempt  from any intellectual influence,  are usually the slaves of some  defunct economist.’’ 
These people are the slaves of the  defunct economists who instruct ed us to ignore the lessons of the  
Great Depression. They have been  discredited enough. But they  are also wrong about Keynes’  message. Unlike the caricature  drawn by his enemies, Keynes  was not against the free market,  free trade or responsible econom ic management.  
There is nothing anti-market or  anti-reform about Keynes’ discov ery that governments have a re sponsibility to employ counter-cy clical fiscal and monetary policy  to avoid damaging recessions.  Almost every responsible govern ment in the world in a position to  do so has followed Keynes’ advice.  And this is something I as Trea surer have been at pains to stress  during our response to the GFC.  
One important aspect of Keynes’  work that has been deliberately  under-emphasised by conserva tive critics is that phrase ‘coun ter-cyclical’ – because it implies  the opposite of the critics’ claim  that Keynesian policies constitute  a recipe for ever-increasing rates  of public spending as a propor tion of GDP.  
Now this brings me again to the  main point of my essay. 
As stated clearly in the findings  of the Banking Royal Commis 
sion (on which Ben Chifley sat),  while governments have a re sponsibility to increase public  spending going into a recession,  once growth and prosperity have  been restored, they have an equal  responsibility to restrain public  expenditure, budget for surplus es and reduce debt in climbing  out. 
That’s why I have been at pains  to stress the Government would  take the hard decisions neces sary to make the Budget sustain able, to chart the course back  to surplus, and to reduce debt  in the medium term. When we  announced our stimulus plans  we also articulated the path  back to surplus by constraining  spending growth and letting  the automatic stabilisers work  on the upside, just as we did  on the downside. The success  of our plans meant that by the  time the IMF and G20 first began  to talk about the need for well articulated exit strategies, we  were already implementing one.  We were ahead of the curve in  response to the downturn, and in  the recovery. 
This strategy hasn’t and  
shouldn’t change in light of re cent events at home and abroad.  The disasters in Japan, our  second biggest trading partner  and our third largest source of  foreign investment, will signifi cantly disrupt Australian exports  in the months ahead. Similarly,  the floods and Cyclone Yasi that  devastated Queensland this  summer will reduce growth and  tax revenue in coming quarters,  and the Government will need to  make room for the substantial re building and recovery costs. This  will undoubtedly have an impact  on the economy and on the bud get bottom-line in the short term. 
But none of this has knocked  Australia off its longer-term  course. The fundamentals are 

www.fabian.org.au 7 

strong and our economy is run ning at close to capacity. We have  low unemployment, strengthen ing incomes, terms of trade close  to their highest sustained level in  140 years, and an unprecedented  pipeline of investment. Most  importantly, mining boom mark  II as I have called it, will impose  on us structural changes equal in  magnitude to any we have seen  before. 
This economic environment un derscores the importance of our  fiscal commitments and strategy  to return the Budget to surplus.  That’s why for example we’re  paying as we go for the recov ery costs in Queensland with a  combination of spending cuts and  a temporary levy. Through our  cap on real spending growth and  the fastest fiscal consolidation in  at least 40 years, we are creating  space for the significant expan sion in our nation’s capital base  that businesses have planned.  
Just as we supported demand  during the global recession, we’re  making way for private demand  in the expansion. Our fiscal strat egy has been consistent from day  one, and consistent with our re forms to strengthen and broaden  our economy by cutting business  taxes, investing in infrastructure  and boosting national savings. It  is also consistent with our desire  to ensure the benefits of the min ing boom outlast the boom itself. 
Many have suggested that we  should be less concerned about  deficit and debt, wrongly point ing to so-called ‘Keynesian’ rea sons relating to their low levels  in Australia compared to other  developed nations. Those facts  are true; Australia is in a better  fiscal position. But those facts  cannot be used as excuses to open  the fiscal gate and allow ill-disci plined public spending. Adopting  Keynesian strategies for avoiding  recession does not mean jettison 
ing the reform lessons that made  us more prosperous over the last  three decades. 
Compared to the events of 1929  and the fate of the Scullin Gov ernment, the Australian story  in the aftermath of the GFC has  been a more positive one, though  it is also true that in our patch work economy not everybody is  feeling the gains. Even so, almost  alone among the developed  economies, we escaped a deep and  damaging recession, with all the  hardship that would bring.  
One of the fundamental reasons  for this is that we had the com mon sense to follow the broad  prescriptions outlined by Keynes.  We acted confidently, swiftly, on  a broad front, and in sufficient  scale to rebuild consumer and  investor confidence and fill the  hole left by collapsing world and  domestic demand for Australia’s  products. We also moved to shore  up the fundamentals of our finan cial system to keep it operating  effectively.  
This wasn’t done because of any  politically-motivated ideological  preference. And it wasn’t done  because we had suddenly rejected  the commitment to competition enhancing economic reforms that  the ALP has championed since  the beginning of the Hawke and  Keating eras. We did these things  because we learned the lessons  of the past. And we did them  because Labor, guided by Keynes,  is driven by a morality that  regards unemployment, ruined  businesses, foreclosed mortgages  and myriad other signs of eco nomic distress not as part of an  inevitable and desirable cleansing  process for the economy, but as  the symptoms of a recession that  should and can be avoided with  the necessary will.  
This is the broader legacy of  Keynes to Australia: the joining  
of social-democratic morality to  sound and sustainable economic  policy. Through primarily Labor  governments, assisted by great  public servants like Nugget  Coombs and others, Australia has  made capitalism and social de mocracy work together to create  a wealthier and fairer society. In  this way, contemporary Australia  and our economic strategy wears  the stamp of one of the 20th Cen tury’s greatest thinkers.
