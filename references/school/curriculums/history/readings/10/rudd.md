Financial Crisis BY KEVIN RUDD 
From time to time in human history there occur events of a truly seismic  signifi cance, events that mark a turning point between one epoch and the  next, when one orthodoxy is overthrown and another takes its place. The  signifi cance of these events is rarely apparent as they unfold: it becomes  clear only in retrospect, when observed from the commanding heights of  history. By such time it is often too late to act to shape the course of such  events and their effects on the day-to-day working lives of men and women  and the families they support. 

There is a sense that we are now living through just such  a time: barely a decade into the new millennium, barely  20 years since the end of the Cold War and barely 30 years  since the triumph of neo-liberalism – that particular brand  of free-market fundamentalism, extreme capitalism and  excessive greed which became the economic orthodoxy of  our time. 
The agent for this change is what we now call the global  financial crisis. In the space of just 18 months, this crisis has  become one of the greatest assaults on global economic stab ility to have occurred in three-quarters of a century. As others  have written, it “reflects the greatest regulatory failure in  modern history”. It is not simply a crisis facing the world’s  largest private financial institutions – systemically serious  as that is in its own right. It is more than a crisis in credit  markets, debt markets, derivatives markets, property markets  and equity markets – notwithstanding the importance of  each of these. 
This is a crisis spreading across a broad front: it is a  financial crisis which has become a general economic crisis;

which is becoming an employment crisis; and which has in  many countries produced a social crisis and in turn a political  crisis. Indeed, accounts are already beginning to emerge of  the long-term geo-political implications of the implosion  on Wall Street – its impact on the future strategic leverage  of the West in general and the United States in particular. 
The global financial crisis has demonstrated already  that it is no respecter of persons, nor of particular indus tries, nor of national boundaries. It is a crisis which is simul taneously individual, national and global. It is a crisis of both  the developed and the developing world. It is a crisis  which is at once institutional, intellectual and ideological.  It has called into question the prevailing neo-liberal econ omic orthodoxy of the past 30 years – the orthodoxy that  has underpinned the national and global regulatory frame works that have so spectacularly failed to prevent the econ omic mayhem which has now been visited upon us. 
Not for the first time in history, the international chal lenge for social democrats is to save capitalism from itself:  to recognise the great strengths of open, competitive markets  

while rejecting the extreme capitalism and unrestrained greed  that have perverted so much of the global financial system in  recent times. It fell to Franklin Delano Roosevelt to rebuild  American capitalism after the Depression. It fell also to the  American Democrats, strongly influenced by John Maynard  Keynes, to rebuild postwar domestic demand, to engineer  the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe and to set in place the

Bretton Woods system to govern international economic  engagement. And so it now falls to President Obama’s  administration – and to those who will provide internation al support for his leadership – to support a global financial  system that properly balances private incentive with public  responsibility in response to the grave challenges presented  by the current crisis. The common thread uniting all three  of these episodes is a reliance on the agency of the state to reconstitute properly regulated markets and to rebuild dom 
estic and global demand.  
The second challenge for social democrats is not to throw  the baby out with the bathwater. As the global financial crisis  unfolds and the hard impact on jobs is felt by families across  the world, the pressure will be great to retreat to some model  of an all-providing state and to abandon altogether the cause  of open, competitive markets both at home and abroad.  Protectionism has already begun to make itself felt, albeit in  softer and more subtle forms than the crudity of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Soft or hard, protectionism is a  sure-fire way of turning recession into depression, as it ex acerbates the collapse in global demand. The intellectual  challenge for social democrats is not just to repudiate the  neo-liberal extremism that has landed us in this mess, but to  advance the case that the social-democratic state offers the  best guarantee of preserving the productive capacity of prop erly regulated competitive markets, while ensuring that gov 
ernment is the regulator, that government is the funder or  provider of public goods and that government offsets the  inevitable inequalities of the market with a commitment to  fairness for all. Social democracy’s continuing philosophical  claim to political legitimacy is its capacity to balance the  private and the public, profit and wages, the market and  the state. That philosophy once again speaks with clarity  and cogency to the challenges of our time. 
Social-democratic governments across the world must  rise to the further challenge of developing a practical policy  response to the crisis that rebuilds shattered economic  growth, while also devising a new regulatory regime for the  fi nancial markets of the future. This is our immediate chal lenge. But if we fail, there is a grave danger that new politi 
cal voices of the extreme Left and the nationalist Right will  begin to achieve a legitimacy hitherto denied them. Again,  history is replete with the most disturbing of precedents. We therefore need a frank analysis of the central role of  
Essay 
neo-liberalism in the underlying causes of the current econ omic crisis. We also need a robust analysis of the social democratic approach to properly regulated markets and the  proper role of the state, in a new contract for the future that  eschews the extremism of both the Left and the Right. And  we must integrate this analysis with the unprecedented  imperative for global co-operation if governments are to  prevail in their task. 
..................................................... 
Around the world today, there is understandable public  bewilderment at the speed, severity and scope of the unfold ing crisis. While the causes of the global financial crisis  are complex, a small number of simple metrics are capable  of conveying its magnitude and the havoc it has wrought  in financial markets, the real economy and government  finances. 
Financial markets have suffered the greatest dislocation  in our lifetime. Global equity markets have lost approxi mately US$32 trillion in value since their peak, which is  equivalent to the combined GDP of the G7 countries in  2008. Credit markets have all but dried up, with credit  growth at its lowest level since World War II. And, at the  core of the crisis, house prices are plummeting in many  countries, with American prices falling at their fastest rate  since modern records began.  
The real economy is facing one of its toughest periods on  record, with the IMF predicting that advanced economies  will contract for the first time in 60 years, causing the num ber of unemployed to rise by 8 million across the OECD.  In developing countries, the International Labour Organiz ation predicts that the financial and economic crisis could  push more than 100 million people into poverty.  
Furthermore, the crisis is producing unprecedented costs  and debts for governments which will be felt for decades to  come. It is estimated that the 2009 deficit in the United  States will be as high as 12.5% of GDP. And estimates of  the combined (actual and contingent) liabilities from the  array of bank bailouts and guarantees run to more than $13  trillion – more than the cost of all the major wars the United  States has ever fought. What this means for future American  international borrowing is equally unprecedented. 
Bewilderment, however, rapidly turns to anger when the  economic crisis touches the lives of families through rising  unemployment, reduced wage growth and collapsing asset  values – while executive remuneration in the financial sector  continues to go through the roof, apparently disconnected  from the reality of recent events. In 2007, S&P 500 CEOs  averaged $10.5 million (some 344 times the pay of typical  American workers). The top 50 hedge-fund and private equity fund managers averaged $588 million each (19,000

times the pay of typical workers). In 2007, the five biggest  Wall Street firms paid bonuses of a staggering $39 billion –  huge payments to the executives whose investment banks  have since been bailed out by American taxpayers. 
These are epic numbers, generated by a greed of epic pro portions. For a bewildered and increasingly enraged public,  they raise the following questions: How was this allowed

to happen? What ideology, what policy, what abuses made  this possible? Were there any warnings? And if so, why  were they ignored? 
..................................................... 
George Soros has said that “the salient feature of the current  financial crisis is that it was not caused by some external  shock … the crisis was generated by the system itself”. Soros  is right. The current crisis is the culmination of a 30-year  domination of economic policy by a free-market ideology that  has been variously called neo-liberalism, economic liberal ism, economic fundamentalism, Thatcherism or the Wash 
ington Consensus. The central thrust of this ideology has  been that government activity should be constrained, and  ultimately replaced, by market forces. 
In the past year, we have seen how unchecked market  forces have brought capitalism to the precipice. The banking  systems of the Western world have come close to collapse.  Almost overnight, policymakers and economists have torn  up the neo-liberal playbook and governments have made un precedented and extraordinary interventions to stop the panic  and bring the global financial system back from the brink. 
Even the great neo-liberal ideological standard-bearer,  the long-serving chairman of the US Federal Reserve Alan  Greenspan, recently conceded in testimony before Congress  that his ideological viewpoint was flawed, and that the  “whole intellectual edifice” of modern risk management had  collapsed. Henry Waxman, the chairman of the Congres sional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,  questioned Greenspan further: “In other words, you found  that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right; it  was not working?” Greenspan replied, “Absolutely, precisely.”  This mea culpa by the man once called ‘the Maestro’ has  reverberated around the world. 
To understand the failure of neo-liberalism, it is neces sary to consider its central elements. The ideology of the  unrestrained free market, discredited by the Great Depres sion, re-emerged in the 1970s amid a widespread belief that  the prevailing economic woes of high inflation and low  growth were exclusively the result of excessive government  intervention in the market. In the ’80s, the Reagan and  Thatcher governments gave political voice to this neo liberal movement of anti-tax, anti-regulation, anti-govern ment conservatives.

Neo-liberal policy prescriptions flow from the core  theoretical belief in the superiority of unregulated markets –  particularly unregulated financial markets. These claims  ultimately rest on the “efficient-markets hypothesis”, which,  in its strongest form, claims that financial-market prices,  like stock-market prices, incorporate all available informa tion, and therefore represent the best possible estimate of  asset prices. It follows, therefore, that if markets are fully  efficient and prices fully informed, there is no reason to be lieve that asset-price bubbles are probable; and if these do  occur, markets will self-correct; and that there is therefore  no justification for government intervention to stop them  occurring. Indeed, in the neo-liberal view, deviations from  market effi ciency must be attributable to external causes.  Bubbles and other disruptions are caused by governments  and other “imperfections”, not by markets themselves. This  theory justifi es the belief that individual self-interest should  be given free rein and that the income distribution gener ated by markets should be regarded as natural and inherent ly just. In the neo-liberal view, markets are spontaneous and  self-regulating products of civil society, while governments  are alien and coercive intruders. 
Neo-liberal economic philosophy has its roots in the  theories of Hayek and von Mises, who believed that society  should be characterised by the “spontaneous order” which  emerges when individuals pursue their own ends within  a framework set by law and tradition. Ideally, the role of  governments is simply to enforce contracts and protect the  allocation of property rights. All other economic functions  should be left to what Reagan called “the magic of the  market”. Hayek himself referred to the market as “a game”  – specifically the game of “catallaxy”, taken from the Greek  word “to barter”, which according to Hayek is “a contest  played according to the rules and decided by superior  skill, strength or good fortune”. In Hayek’s order, “the  game” is the only proper determinant of the allocation of  resources, in contrast to any “atavistic” concept of social  justice alive in the social-democratic project.  
The advocates of neo-liberalism have sought, wherever  possible, to dismantle all aspects of the social-democratic  state. The idea of social solidarity, reflected in the collective  provision of social goods, is dismissed as statist nonsense.  In the face of vigorous resistance to cuts in public services,  the neo-liberal political project has followed a strategy of  “starving the beast”, cutting taxes in order to strangle the  capacity of the government to invest in education, health  and economic infrastructure. The end point: to provide  maximal space in the economy for private markets. 
Neo-liberalism progressively became the economic  orthodoxy. It was reflected in wave after wave of tax cuts.  Governments bragged about their success in reducing  

measured levels of debt, while refusing to acknowledge  the long-term economic cost of non-investment in educa tion, skills and training (which increase productivity), and  repudiating an appropriate role for public debt in financing  investment in the infrastructure that underpins long-term  economic growth.

After a $300-million lobbying effort by the financial services industry, Glass-Steagall was effectively repealed in  1999, removing the prohibition on commercial banks own ing investment banks. The door was now open for the  creation of huge financial-services conglomerates. One of  the first to take advantage of the new regime was Citigroup,  formed from the regular bank Citicorp and Travelers Group,  which had previously incorporated the investment bank  Salomon Smith Barney. The problem was that such combi ned entities became too systemically important to fail, yet  their investment-banking arms were allowed to engage in  speculation on a massive scale – so great as to imperil the

market failure. Climate change is a potent example. What  Sir Nicholas Stern legitimately describes as the greatest  market failure in human history is dismissed by neo-liberals  as a prescription for wanton interference in market forces. 
..................................................... 
The neo-liberal deregulation mantra has been even more  evident in the management of financial markets. In the  United States, the pursuit of financial deregulation crossed  the Rubicon with the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which  had been established in the wake of the Great Depression.  In the heady bubble years of the 1920s, American commer cial banks, whose traditional function was simply to take  deposits and make loans, plunged into the roaring bull  market, trading on their own account, underwriting new  stock issues and participating in reckless speculation. When  the stock-market bubble burst in 1929, it took commer cial banks with it, causing a devastating chain reaction  which affected the entire economy for a decade. President  Roosevelt implemented Glass-Steagall in 1933 to prevent  Main Street commercial banks from being exposed to the  vagaries of Wall Street in the future. As Keynes, himself a  
finances of any government that had to bail them out. Citi group was in fact to become the recipient of a taxpayer funded rescue package worth an estimated $249 billion. It  is ironic and – given the anti-government orthodoxy of neo liberals – grossly hypocritical that the massive exposure to  risk of these private financial conglomerates has resulted  in a parallel exposure of the government, given the scale  of possible government intervention in the event of bank  failure. During the bubble, however, no account was taken  of this, as massive profits were privatised and prospective  losses socialised through the operation of implicit banking  guarantees. 
At the international level, bank risk is regulated by the  Basel Accord. Yet the Basel II guidelines, published in June  2004, have now been demonstrated to be inadequate because  they left the determination of risk to flawed credit-ratings  processes and the banks’ own “self-regulated” internal assess ment models. Even then, the Basel rules were easily circum 
vented using innovative financial structures: structured in vestment vehicles were deliberately employed to shift risk  off bank balance sheets. As Joseph Stiglitz has argued, “many  of America’s big banks moved out of the ‘lending’ business

and into the ‘moving’ business,” focusing on originating  loans, repackaging them and selling them on, with little  emphasis on their traditional role of assessing risk and  screening credit worthiness.  
Instead, the crucial risk-assessment function was passed,  in large part, to the ratings agencies. Dependent as they  were on the banks for their revenue, the agencies were hope

lessly conflicted by the lure of big profits in return for easy  ratings. Jerome Fons, former managing director for credit  quality at Moody’s, admitted in October 2008 that “the  focus of Moody’s shifted from protecting investors to being  a marketing-driven organization … management’s focus  increasingly turned to maximizing revenues.” Ultimately, this  focus on the bottom line contributed to an atmosphere in  which a number of private ratings agencies became too  inclined to take a favourable view of the risks inherent in  their clients’ investments.  
Financial liberalisation also gave rise to a plethora of  new, unregulated financial institutions in what is now broadly  defi ned as the bank-intermediation market: hedge funds,  private-equity funds, mortgage brokers. Investment banks  with debt-to-equity ratios of 30:1 were also propped up  by weak and defective accounting standards, which encour aged listed companies to “mark to market” their assets:  that is, to effectively revalue their assets at market prices  as they soared during booms.  
A series of major national and international financial  crises over the past decade should have begun to give pause  for refl ection, intervention and action. The Asian financial  crisis of 1997 caused large-scale economic and social devas 
tation and led to a flurry of calls for a “new international  fi nancial architecture”. But these calls were always smugly  discounted by the advanced economies as being primarily  for the benefit of the Asian and other developing econ 
omies that had been caught up in the crisis. It was easier to  blame “crony capitalism” than to look at the fundamentals  of the neo-liberal orthodoxy (including unrestrained hedge fund assaults on national currencies) that continued to  govern global financial markets. Further warning signs came, including the bailout of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital  Management (LTCM) in 1998 and the spectacular dotcom  bubble and bust of 2000–01.  
Each time a crisis arose, the US Federal Reserve came to  the rescue by significantly lowering the federal funds rate, in  order to pump liquidity back into the market and avert any  further deterioration. After the 1987 stock-market crash, the  Gulf War, the 1994 Mexican crisis, the 1997–98 Asian finan cial crisis, the LTCM debacle of 1998 and the 2000–01 burst 
ing of the internet bubble, the response was always the same. Investors increasingly came to believe that when things  went bad, they would be protected by monetary policy in

what came to be known as the “Greenspan put” – low inter est rates, high liquidity and the protection of asset prices.  Easy monetary policy was seen as an elixir that could cure  any market instability that arose. In fact, it added yet more  fuel to the fi re, in the form of cheap money available for  lending.  
Low interest rates brought forth a new class of borrow ers in the US who were encouraged by mortgage brokers to  buy their own home. As a result, a huge amount of capital  rushed into the sub-prime mortgage market, where it was  directed towards borrowers with weak credit histories. At  the same time, the prevailing anti-regulation culture in  financial markets fostered a new banking model – the so 
called originate-and-distribute model. Mortgage brokers  originated loans that were then sold on to others, including  hedge funds and structured investment vehicles, thereby  severing the link between the assessor of credit worthi 
ness and the ultimate holder of the loan. This is where the  two worlds met: the world of easy credit as the defi ning  characteristic of Greenspan’s neo-liberal financial order,  and the other neo-liberal world of unregulated financial  institutions with its new banking model that effectively atom ised risk. The combination was toxic: it produced an asset  bubble of unprecedented proportions and, most critically,  with unprecedented reach across the global financial system  through the bank-intermediation market. Were the bubble  to burst, the links to the mainstream commercial-banking  system, with its implicit government guarantees, meant that  the state (not the market) would be left carrying the can.  This is the essence of the neo-liberal legacy now left to tax payers – both today and into the future.  
The rest, of course, is history. The annual volume of US  sub-prime and other securitised mortgages rose from approx imately $160 billion in 2001 to over $600 billion in 2006. Low  interest rates and high demand for housing caused house  prices to soar. In comparison to the 1.4% average annual  appreciation of American home values during the 30 years  leading up to 2000, the values of homes increased at 7.6%  annually from 2000 to 2006, with massive growth in the  sub-prime market. Indications of fi nancial instability slowly  became apparent to all who cared to look. Business leader  Warren Buffett had recognised the emerging risks of financial  innovation, easy money and weak regulation in 2003 when he  noted that many of the new fi nancial instruments were akin  to “financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers  that, while now latent, are potentially lethal”.  
The Bank for International Settlements, always more  sceptical than most, was the first official institution to  sound the alarm. In its 2007 annual report, the BIS warned  that “years of loose monetary policy have fuelled a giant  global credit bubble, leaving us vulnerable to another 1930s 
style slump.” Despite this, no systemic action was taken. Despite three crises in a decade, despite the clear warn ings that came with them and after them, the neo-liberals  were so convinced of the ideological righteousness of their  cause, and so blinded by their unquestioning belief that  markets were inherently self-correcting, that they refused  even to recognise the severity of the problems that emerged.

The problems did not fi t the model, so the evidence was  simply discarded. Hardline neo-liberals were not interested,  because they knew in their hearts they were right. 
The time has come, off the back of the current crisis, to  proclaim that the great neo-liberal experiment of the past  30 years has failed, that the emperor has no clothes. Neo liberalism, and the free-market fundamentalism it has pro duced, has been revealed as little more than personal greed  dressed up as an economic philosophy. And, ironically, it  now falls to social democracy to prevent liberal capitalism  from cannibalising itself.  
..................................................... 
With the demise of neo-liberalism, the role of the state has  once more been recognised as fundamental. The state has  been the primary actor in responding to three clear areas  of the current crisis: in rescuing the private fi nancial system  from collapse; in providing direct stimulus to the real econ omy because of the collapse in private demand; and in the  design of a national and global regulatory regime in which  government has ultimate responsibility to determine and  enforce the rules of the system. 
The challenge for social democrats today is to recast the  role of the state and its associated political economy of social  democracy as a comprehensive philosophical framework  for the future – tempered both for times of crisis and for  times of prosperity. In doing so, social democrats will  draw in part on a long-standing Keynesian tradition. Social  democrats will also need to reach beyond Keynes, given  some of the new realities we face some 70 years after the  publication of Keynes’s General Theory. 
Long before the term ‘Third Way’ was popularised in  the policy literature of the 1990s, social democrats viewed  themselves as presenting a political economy of the middle  way, which rejected both state socialism and free-market  fundamentalism. Instead, social democrats maintain robust  support for the market economy but posit that markets can  only work in a mixed economy, with a role for the state as  regulator and as a funder and provider of public goods. Trans parency and competitive neutrality, ensured by a regime of  competition and consumer-protection law, are essential. 
Social justice is also viewed as an essential component of  the social-democratic project. The social-democratic pursuit  of social justice is founded on a belief in the self-evident value  
Essay 
of equality, rather than, for example, an exclusively utilitar ian argument that a particular investment in education is  justified because it yields increases in productivity growth  (although, happily, from the point of view of modern social  democrats, both things happen to be true). Expressed more  broadly, the pursuit of social justice is founded on the argu 
ment that all human beings have an intrinsic right to human  dignity, equality of opportunity and the ability to lead a ful filling life. In a similar vein, Amartya Sen writes of freedom  as the means to achieve economic stability and growth, but  also as an end in itself. Accordingly, government has a clear  role in the provision of such public goods as universal educa 
tion, health, unemployment insurance, disabilities insurance  and retirement income. This contrasts with the Hayekian  view that a person’s worth should primarily, and unsenti mentally, be determined by the market.  
Social-democratic governments face the continuing  challenge of harnessing the power of the market to increase  innovation, investment and productivity growth – while  combining this with an effective regulatory framework  which manages risk, corrects market failures, funds and pro vides public goods, and pursues social equity. Examples of  such a government are the Australian Labor governments of  Bob Hawke and Paul Keating during the 1980s and early ’90s.  Hawke and Keating pursued an ambitious and unapologetic  program of economic modernisation. Their reforms inter nationalised the Australian economy, removed protectionist  barriers and opened it up to greater competition. They were  able dramatically to improve the productivity of the Aus 
tralian private economy, while simultaneously expanding the  role of the state in the provision of equity-enhancing public  services in health and education. 
..................................................... 
In the current crisis, social democrats therefore have the  great advantage of a consistent position on the central role  of the state – in contrast to neo-liberals, who now find  themselves tied in ideological knots, in being forced to  rely on the state they fundamentally despise to save financial  markets from collapse. This enables social-democratic gov ernments to undertake such current practical tasks as credit 
market regulation, intervention, and demand-side stimulus  in the economy. The uncomfortable truth for neo-liberals is  that they have not been able to turn to non-state actors or  non-state mechanisms to defray risk and restore confi dence,  rebuild balance sheets and unlock global capital flows. This  is only possible through the agency of the state.  
In the early stages of the global financial collapse, the  centrality of the state was reaffirmed by governments of  both the classical Left and Right as they acted to guarantee  the integrity of the banking system. Die-hard neo-liberals

institutions. The willingness of the public, as expressed  through their respective governments, to accept the associ ated contingent liabilities reveals a widely held perception  that the stability of banking systems is itself a public  good. As Robert Skidelsky, Keynes’s biographer, observed:  “when the crunch came, we discovered that national tax 
payers still stand behind banks, and national insolvency  regimes matter.” 
Subsequently, governments have also demonstrated a  willingness to undertake unprecedented interventions in  private credit markets. Specifically, governments have in volved themselves in the capitalisation of banks, the direct  purchase of bank and corporate securities, the establishment  of joint-purpose vehicles to share risk with private financial 
institutions, and in sovereign guarantees to underpin inter bank lending. In the United States, the rescue of Citigroup  and the Bank of America amounts to a de facto national isation. This followed the placing into conservatorship of  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the effective nationalis ation of AIG, the world’s largest insurance company. Once  again, the social-democratic state, not the unfettered forces  of the market, was called to the rescue. 
These measures have not been implemented on the basis  of socialist ideology, nor are they a return to state ownership  and control. When the financial system stabilises and the  global recession eases, we can expect to see governments  pulling back from direct involvement in the ownership and  operation of the banking sector. The object of the current  intervention is to secure private credit markets so that  they can serve the needs of private businesses and con sumers. But clearly the days of effective non-regulation and  unconstrained fi nancial innovation are gone, and must not  be allowed to return. The consequences for the economy  are too great. 
Stabilising the financial system is a necessary first step  towards preventing systemic collapse. But the collapse of the  speculative bubble and the subsequent credit squeeze have  already brought about a slowdown in economic growth,  rising unemployment, and the possibility of a lengthy global  recession. Neo-liberals such as Alan Moran, of the Austral ian Institute of Public Affairs, argue that the cost of the  recession should be borne by employees, through wage cuts  and retrenchment – exactly the position of US Treasury  Secretary Andrew Mellon at the outset of the Great Depres 
sion. Social democrats, by contrast, stress the central role  of the state in maintaining aggregate demand, both for  consumption and investment spending, at a time of falter ing growth. That is, the state must involve itself in direct  demand-side stimulus to offset the large-scale contraction  in private demand. The IMF revised its growth forecast  for 2009 down four times, by a total of 3% of global GDP.  This “growth gap” indicates the dimensions of the fi scal 
stimulus task that now lies ahead for governments if the  demand-side gap is to be met and massive unemployment  avoided. This is classic Keynesianism, pure and simple.  
Keynes argued that, in Stiglitz’s words, “in a severe down turn, monetary policy was likely to be ineffective. Fiscal policy  was required.” He believed that in times of dramatically  slowed economic growth, monetary authorities would find  themselves in a liquidity trap, unable to “induce an increase  in the supply of credit in order to raise the level of economic  activity”. Or, as others have described it, monetary policy  becomes ineffective because it is just “pushing on a string”.  Indeed, as Paul Krugman suggests, “the failure of monetary  policy in the current crisis shows that Keynes had it right the  first time.” The truth is, fiscal policy must reinforce monetary  policy in aggregate demand. Neither by itself is sufficient. 
Reasoning that the costs of failing to provide fiscal stimu lus will outweigh the negative effect on budgets, Tony Blair  implores current leaders to “do whatever it takes … to get  the blood pumping back round the financial system again”.  The challenge for new Keynesians is also to ensure that  this stimulus is targeted, timely and temporary. As private  consumption and business investment recover, fiscal stimu 
lus should be reduced commensurately, so as not to push  up inflation during the period of economic recovery. In proposing active measures to stimulate demand, it  is therefore important to emphasise the central tenet of  Keynesian economic management: the need to balance  budgets over the course of the economic cycle. Failure to do  so, along with excessive tolerance for inflation, was a major  contributor to the breakdown of Keynesian economic  management in the early 1970s. Increases in public invest ment and direct transfers to households will stimulate the  economy, but they will have to be paid for in the future, when  strong economic growth has resumed. 
Social democrats have always emphasised the potential  for systemic shocks arising from speculative bubbles and  busts driven by what Keynes referred to as the unpredictable  “animal spirits” of investors. Financial regulation must allow  banks and other financial institutions to be intermediaries  between household savings and business investment, with out themselves becoming a source of systemic instability.  This requires prudential regulation beyond simply ensuring  that individual institutions adhere to standards designed

The sector as a whole should be constrained from  actions that promote systemic risk, such as excessive  expansion of derivatives markets.

A further challenge for social democrats in dealing with the  current crisis is its almost unprecedented global dimensions.  This has two aspects: the integration and interdependence  
markets require effective national regulation; second, global  financial markets require effective global regulation, if for  no other reason than that the quantum of global financial  transactions is now capable of overwhelming most single  national economies standing alone; and third, the means for  achieving effective regulation in both can only be delivered  by national governments operating together. There has been  no private financial-market solution on offer to deal with  the scale and complexity of global systemic instability we  now face. 
That is why the world has turned to co-ordinated govern mental action through the G20: to help provide imme diate liquidity to the global financial system; to co-ordinate  sufficient fiscal stimulus to respond to the growth gap aris ing from the global recession; to redesign global regulatory  
rules for the future, including a new Basel III; to reform the  

The stakes are high: there are the economic and social  costs of long-term unemployment; poverty once again  expanding its grim reach across the developing world; and  the impact on long-term power structures within the existing  international political and strategic order.

of fi nancial markets, which has brought about a rapid spread  of the contagion; and the consequences for the real economy  as collapsing demand in one country affects exports from  another. 
Instead of distributing risk throughout the world, the  global fi nancial system has intensifi ed it. Neo-liberal ortho doxy held that global fi nancial markets would ultimately  self-correct – the invisible hand of unfettered market forces  finding their own equilibrium. But as Stiglitz has caustical ly observed: “the reason that the invisible hand often seems  invisible is that it is not there.” Financial markets have  not self-corrected. Global financial innovation has com pounded the problem of asset bubbles, not reduced it.  Neo-liberalism’s anti-regulation agenda rapidly converted  a problem in American mortgage markets into a full-blown  global fi nancial and economic crisis that now threatens the  future of open global markets – yet another example of  capitalism cannibalising itself, but this time on a frightening,  global scale. 
Three cardinal principles emerge: first, national financial  
existing global public institutions – especially the IMF – to  provide them with the powers and resources necessary for  the demands of the twenty-first century. The tragedy is that  after decades of neo-liberal ascendancy, the IMF, Keynes’s  child from Bretton Woods, for a time became the agency  through which neo-liberal doctrines were spread around the  world – to the detriment of the fund’s long-term standing  and with a real impact on its capacity to act effectively in  the current crisis with the various national economies it has  treated poorly in the past. 
Governments must craft consistent global financial regu lations to prevent a race to the bottom, where capital leaks  out to the areas of the global economy with the weakest  regulation. We must establish stronger global disclosure  standards for systemically important financial institutions.  We must also build stronger supervisory frameworks to  provide incentives for more responsible corporate conduct,  including executive remuneration. 
Further, the IMF’s authority to undertake prudential  analysis must be expanded and its early-warning system for

institutional vulnerabilities enhanced. And its governance  arrangements must be reformed. It makes no sense for the  governance structure of the global financial system today  to refl ect the balance of power in 1944.

decision-making voice in these forums.  
The longer-term challenge for governments is to address  the imbalances that have helped to destabilise the global  economy in the past decade: in particular, the imbalances  between large surplus economies such as China, Japan and  the oil-exporting nations, and large debtor nations such as  America. In the short term, these imbalances are likely to  increase as America’s budget deficit balloons. In the medium  term, overcoming these imbalances and working towards a  more stable global macroeconomic framework will demand  new levels of global economic co-operation and co-ordination.  Any sudden change in managing these global imbalances –  for example, if China sharply reduced the purchase of US  government bonds – would send tremors through foreign exchange markets, with dire consequences both for the US  dollar and for the prospects of global economic recovery.  Again, this looms as a challenge for statecraft; we cannot  simply hope that individual market participants somehow  magically do the right thing. 
There is one further dimension to the role of social  democrats in dealing with the current global crisis. The  impact of the crisis on poverty and political stability in the  developing world has not fully registered in the global  debate about policy responses to the crisis so far. World  Bank intervention, bilateral official development assistance  and the continued implementation of the Millennium  Development Goals become essential elements in manag ing the effects of a crisis that will otherwise throw much of  the developing world back into poverty. Social democrats,  both by instinct and by tradition, are predisposed to engage  in this, but it will become harder and harder as developed  countries’ budgets come under ever more stress from the  unprecedented domestic demands now placed upon them by  the crisis. 
Neo-liberals, like neo-conservatives (their ideological  bedfellows in the foreign-policy sphere), are intrinsically  suspicious of all forms of multilateral governance. In fact,  there is a parallel between neo-liberals’ hostility to national  governments intervening in national markets and their  hostility to international governmental institutions inter vening in global markets. Again, the contrast with social  democrats is instructive, given social democrats’ long  tradition of internationalism – itself an accommodating  attribute given the complexities of global market governance,  
co-operation and co-ordination we all now confront. The  truth is that there are no credible unilateral solutions on offer,  given the increasing dispersal of global economic power. 
..................................................... 
The political home of neo-liberalism in Australia is, of  course, the Liberal Party itself. Over the past decade, the  Howard government reduced investment in key public  goods, including education and health. It also refused to  invest in national economic infrastructure, notwithstanding  multiple warnings from the Reserve Bank of the impact of  long-standing capacity constraints on economic growth.  The Liberals in government also set about the compre hensive deregulation of the labour market – based on the  argument that human labour was no different to any other  commodity. Driven by a philosophy of minimal government  intervention in the markets, the Liberals ignored both the  2003 Dawson Review and multiple reports from the ACCC  calling for the criminalisation of cartel conduct. They refused  to act to prevent the accumulation of market power through  creeping acquisitions. They refused to effectively regulate  consumer credit or credit-rating agencies. And they ignor ed calls – from the Financial Stability Forum in 2000, the  Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority submission to  the HIH Royal Commission in 2002, and the 2006 IMF  Financial Sector Assessment Program – to implement a  deposit-insurance scheme that would bring our deposit pro tection in line with almost all other OECD nations. Most  critically, the Howard government oversaw an unpreceden ted increase in household and national debt. The average ratio  of household debt to annual gross disposable income more  than doubled to 114.5%, up from 49.8% under the Hawke– Keating governments; household net savings to net dispos able income fell to an average of 1.1%, down from an average  of 7.9% under the Hawke–Keating governments; and the  level of Australia’s net foreign debt increased to 55.5% of  GDP, up from 37.9% of GDP under the Hawke–Keating  governments.  
The contrast between the competing political traditions  within Australia on the role of governments and the market  is clear. Labor, in the international tradition of social demo cracy, consistently argues for a central role for government  in the regulation of markets and the provision of public goods.  
Consistent with this tradition, the Labor government  has acted decisively through state action to maintain the  stability of the Australian financial systems in the face of  the economic crisis. The government acted in October to  guarantee all deposits. To support intra-bank lending by  the Australian majors, it intervened to provide a facility  for guaranteeing wholesale funding of financial institutions.  To encourage liquidity, the government legislated to increase

of services in health, education, disabilities and homeless ness; and in roads, rail, ports and other critical infra structure. All through decisive state action. 
The Liberals, embracing the neo-liberal tradition of  anti-regulation, seek to reduce the agency of the state in  private markets as much as possible. The distinction is  reflected in the previous prime minister’s statements that  “competitive capitalism within free markets remains the  most effective economic paradigm, both domestically and  internationally”; that “the right responses will be grounded  in free-market orthodoxies”; and that “we should avoid  the resort to re-regulation.” This ideology has not served  Australia well in preparing for the current crisis. 
..................................................... 
To respond effectively to the global financial crisis in the  future requires the resolution of profound questions from  the past, principal among which is: What caused such a cri sis to result in widespread economic and social devastation?  The magnitude of the crisis and its impact across the world  means that minor tweakings of long-established orthodox 
ies will not do. Two unassailable truths have already been  established: that financial markets are not always self correcting or self-regulating, and that government (nation ally and internationally) can never abdicate responsibility  for maintaining economic stability. These two truths in  themselves destroy neo-liberalism’s claims to any continuing  ideological legitimacy, because they remove the foundations  
on which the entire neo-liberal system is constructed. The extent to which social democracy responds effec tively and sustainably to the challenges now left to us by the  neo-liberals remains an open question. Tempering any ten dencies towards ideological triumphalism from the centre Left at neo-liberalism’s demise is Robert Skidelsky’s recent  and reflective reminder of the cycles of history:  
Societies are said to swing like pendulums between  alternating phases of vigour and decay; progress and  reaction; licentiousness and puritanism. Each out 
ward movement produces a crisis of excess which  leads to a reaction. The equilibrium position is hard  to achieve and always unstable. 
In his Cycles of American History (1986), Arthur  
Schlesinger Jr defined a political economy cycle as  
“a continuing shift in national involvement between  public purpose and private interest” ... 
Others have argued that we are seeing a more fundamen tal regime change: the third in postwar history, starting with  the Keynesian model, from the 1940s to the ’70s; the neo liberal ascendancy, from 1978 to 2008; followed by a new  regime, which is currently being shaped. Perhaps this new  regime will come to be called ‘social capitalism’ or ‘social democratic capitalism’, or simply the term ‘social democracy’  itself. Whatever the nomenclature, the concept is clear: a sys tem of open markets, unambiguously regulated by an activist  state, and one in which the state intervenes to reduce the  greater inequalities that competitive markets will inevitably  generate. 
Either way, seismic changes are underway, fault lines  yielding to fractures which in time may yield to even deeper  tectonic shifts. Neither governments nor the peoples they re present any longer have confidence in an unregulated system  of extreme capitalism. As President Sarkozy put it: “Le  laissez-faire, c’est fini.” Or, as China’s Vice Premier Wang  Qishan reportedly said, somewhat more elliptically: “The  teachers now have some problems.” 
For social democrats, it is critical that we get it right – not  just to save the system of open markets from self-destruction,  but also to rebuild confidence in properly regulated markets,  so as to prevent extreme reactions from the far Left or the  far Right taking hold. Social democrats must also get it  right because the stakes are so high: there are the econ omic and social costs of long-term unemployment; poverty  once again expanding its grim reach across the developing  world; and the impact on long-term power structures within  the existing international political and strategic order. Success  is not optional. Too much now rides on our ability to prevail. 
I believe that social democrats can chart an effective course  that will see us through this crisis, and one that is also  capable of building a fairer and more resilient order for the  long term. This can only be achieved through the creative  agency of government – and through governments acting  together. How could it possibly now be argued that the  minimalist state of which the neo-liberals have dreamt could  somehow be of suffi cient potency to respond to the maximal ist challenge we have been left in the wake of this most spec tacular failure of the entire neo-liberal orthodoxy? Govern 
ment is not the intrinsic evil that neo-liberals have argued it  is. Government, properly constituted and properly directed, is  for the common good, embracing both individual freedom and  fairness, a project designed for the many, not just the few. M 
In preparing this article, Mr Rudd was assisted, with comments and  contributions, by staff, advisors and others with a common interest in  the ideological origins of the current crisis.
