n the weekend of 11 and 12 October 2008, Kevin Rudd, his three 
On 
give away-literally give away-almost $9 billion. 
Without any exact information about the global economic tidal wave breaking on Australian shores, or how effective their spending would be in sand-bagging Australia from its devastation, Rudd, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Minister for Finance Lindsay Tanner determined to send out pre-Christmas cheques worth $8.7 billion, as part of a $10.4 billion stimulus package. 
The government Santa sack was worth as much as its first budget had proposed in new spending over five years on the biggest-ticket election promises for education and health combined. It was almost half as much as the planned military spending that year. 
And the $8.7 billion bonanza was just the first of an extraordinary series of political and policy gambles by the new government in response to the most serious economic crisis to confront this generation. 
Rudd, his ministers and their advisors who gathered that weekend in the windowless cabinet room were heart-stoppingly aware that these were risks that would determine their political fate as well as the fates of thousands of workers who would be the human collateral if the flailing world economy dragged Australia into recession. 
Its two most senior economic ministers weren't even physically in the all-weekend shirt-sleeves-rolled-up crisis meeting of the so-called Strategic Priorities and Budget Committee (SPBC)—the 'gang of four' that effectively ran the new government. 
Swan phoned in to the Sunday morning meeting from Washington, where he was attending International Monetary Fund (IMF) crisis talks. He made the call from a teenage boy's bedroom in Maryland,

gazing at posters of rock legends as he reported back to his tired and nervous colleagues that the international situation was even worse than they had thought. 
He had been at a drinks party at the home of a US-posted Treasury official. 'For some technical reason', the only place it had been possible to install a secure phone line for a phone call back to the meeting in Canberra was in the downstairs bedroom of an embassy official's teenage son, who lived next door. 
'So I am sitting in this bedroom with all these posters of Jimi Hendrix and all this sort of stuff, plugging back in to this SPBC cabinet meeting', recalls Swan. 
Finance minister Lindsay Tanner phoned in from his Melbourne office for most of the two days, with quite different distractions. 
'I was unable to go to Canberra because I had to look after my then 2-year-old daughter, at least for a good part of Saturday, and as it turned out she was in my office for the first few hours of the meeting. I assured the others she wouldn't leak, at least not in that way', says Tanner. 
Labor had been elected less than twelve months earlier as self- professed 'economic conservatives', convincing the Australian people they could manage the apparently never-ending boom years even better than the 11-year-old conservative government had done. 
Within months, that promise, and much of Labor's election agenda, had been overtaken by the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Globally, the boom years had come to a shuddering conclusion and Labor reached for some truly radical solu- tions to cushion Australia from that dramatic end to the economic cycle. 
It began the job with some lucky breaks. The national economy, courtesy of its conservative predecessors, entered the crisis in better economic shape than any other developed nation-with a big budget surplus to draw upon and no net federal government debt.

Australian interest rates were at 7.25 per cent as the crisis hit- much higher than in comparable countries and too high according to many commentators. But it meant the Reserve Bank had plenty of room to move and would eventually cut rates by 4.25 percentage points to try to prop up the economy. And, through commodity exports, Australia was also hitched to the booming Chinese economy, which quickly regained its stride. 
But the new government also made the most of its good fortune. Still edgy and alert to possible danger as it grew accustomed to power, it was better prepared for the onslaught than many other gov- ernments. It acted earlier, and as a proportion of GDP-spent more than any other developed economy except Korea.1 
In total Rudd Labor poured $75 billion into various stimulus packages announced in late 2008 and early 2009. 
All the while it was haunted by a powerful political ghost. 
In 1929 Jim Scullin's Labor party had won government after thirteen years of conservative rule. Like John Howard, long-serving conservative prime minister Stanley Bruce also suffered the ignominy of losing his seat as his government lost office. A week after Scullin's victory Wall Street suffered 'Black Thursday', which marked the start of the Great Depression, Scullin had not reached for radical solutions, agreeing instead in 1931 to drastic cuts in government spending. He lost government that year, with the unemployment rate well over 
20 
per cent. 
Rudd and his senior ministers saw it as their mission to pro- tect Australian workers-their people-from a twenty-first-century depression. 
Both because of the economic conditions they inherited and because of what they did, Australia-alone among the thirty-three advanced nations counted by the IMF-avoided a recession in 2009, achieving positive growth through the year.

The Australian economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the financial year to June 2009. According to the Treasury it would have shrunk by 1.3 per cent without the government's spending.3 
Unlike the United States and Europe, where the number of unemployed had risen to 10 per cent of their workforces by the end of 2009, the ranks of the Australian unemployed drifted up from 4.1 per cent to 5.8 per cent but then the rise stopped. This was an extra 200,000 people without work, but not the 550,000 additional jobless that Treasury anticipated and the Rudd Government had so feared. 
But Australia also emerged from the maelstrom with the budget in deficit, and forecast to remain in the red through the whole of the next electoral cycle. 
Billions of dollars of spending the government labelled as 'stim- ulus' will be spent in 2010-11 and 2011-12, years in which the economy is expected to have bounced back to normal, and extra gov- ernment-funded public works are arguably no longer required to keep it going. 
Both sides of politics are now promising to dramatically rein in government spending to rebalance the books-promises which if kept will require profound changes to policy and to the services and government benefits Australians have come to expect. 
Australia has been almost immediately confronted with exactly the same problems that had dogged the end of the boom years in the lead-up to the crisis: shortages of skilled labour and of basic economic infrastructure ports, roads, railways. But it no longer has surpluses salted away to solve them. 
Crisis management overtook the middle eighteen months of the 3-year electoral cycle-the brief period when Australian govern- ments can get things done before they must start preparing to fight for their re-election.

Its totemic emissions trading policy had been destroyed by the torpedoing of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership and the collapse of the United Nations climate change talks in Copenhagen. 
Turnbull's successor, the former boxer Tony Abbott, came into the job swinging, and landed heavy blows before the government was ready to launch its re-election campaign based on reform of education and health. 
. 
At the same time the government's economic achievements were being overshadowed by the mistakes made in rushing out the spending the botched delivery of the home insulation scheme and the blow-out in the cost of the new school classrooms and halls. 
Kevin Rudd remains proud of the way his government handled the crisis, implementation problems notwithstanding. And he believes the Australian people agree. 
Tony Abbott will go to the 2010 election arguing that the polit- ical and financial costs of avoiding recession have been too high; Labor panicked and overreacted to a crisis that was never going to hit Australia as hard as the government feared. 
This is the inside story of the new Rudd Government and the recession it turned out Australia did not have to have, based on the detailed accounts of every key player. 
It is also the inside story of the even greater tumult inside the coalition, riven by leadership rivalry and deep policy divisions before the unexpected election of Tony Abbott allowed it to revive and regroup ahead of the 2010 poll. 
The panic of 2008 and 2009 may be fading from popular memory as Australians continue their lives much as normal. But it was arguably the 
greatest external threat the country has faced since World War II. The Rudd Government's response defines its first term, what it did, 
5 
PROLOGUE 
what it didn't do, and what it can afford to do next. And the aftermath of the crisis will define the election battle in which Labor seeks a second term, both for Kevin Rudd and for the socially conservative, economically opaque and politically pugilistic Tony Abbott. 
For Abbott the ghost of Scullin is an inspiration. "The last Commonwealth government elected in the shadow of an interna- tional financial crisis, the Scullin Government of 1929, lasted just one term. The last government elected at the close of a long boom, the Whitlam Government in 1972, lasted just three years', he writes in his 2009 political manifesto Battlelines as he urges conservatives against despondency and insists the next election remains winnable.* 
Rudd, the methodical former bureaucrat, prepared for the crisis and acted decisively. He succeeded in getting stimulus spending out the door fast enough for it to save Australia from its worst impact. Now his pitch for re-election is based on a disaster his government avoided and marred by the new set of mistakes he made along the way. In March 2009 Rudd controversially predicted on national tele- vision a 'political shitstorm' when the budget descended into deficit. Back then he had no way of knowing how fierce it would be.
