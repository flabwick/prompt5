**Student Progress Report (as of 20-05-25)**

**Units Covered and Performance Overview**

**Unit: Random Variables, Sample Space, and Probability Distributions**
**Coverage:** 90%
**Current XP:** 90 → Stage 2
Student has internalized basic concepts: outcomes, events, sample space, probability distribution tables. They showed good accuracy with event probability and were able to use structure for expected value. However, formal mapping of random variables and graphical (histogram) interpretation is weak.
**Recommend revisiting:** Visual interpretation (histogram, CDF).

---

**Unit: Expected Value, Moments, and Variance**
**Coverage:** 85%
**Current XP:** 470 → Mid Stage 3
Progressed well: strong conceptual understanding and nearly error-free computation of expectation. Variance introduced with self-corrected error; squaring rationale and SD interpretation were well explained.
Skewness was approached visually but lacked precision; higher moments (kurtosis) remain untouched.
**Recommend introducing:** Kurtosis, linearity of expectation, variance under transformation.
**Recommend revisiting:** Skewness for formal positioning and visual identification.

**Unit: Binary Regressors and Group Differences**
**Coverage:** 85%
**Current XP:** 210 → Stage 2
Student now accurately computes group means and interprets β₀ and β₁ in binary regression after initial confusion. They can handle direction reversal and apply interpretation logic independently.
Still lacks fluency with regression language beyond binary framing.
**Recommend introducing:** Visuals of regression line separation, connection to hypothesis testing.
**Recommend revisiting:** β₀/β₁ meaning in unfamiliar datasets.

**Unit: Four OLS Assumptions**
**Coverage:** 25%
**Current XP:** 60 → Mid Stage 1
Only Assumption 1 (E\[u|X] = 0) was engaged meaningfully. Student recognized omitted variable bias and inferred causality correctly. Other assumptions were untouched.
**Recommend introducing:** Assumptions 2–4 (IID, finite moments, homoskedasticity).
**Recommend revisiting:** Assumption 1 with symbolic and algebraic emphasis.

---

**Unit: Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)**
**Coverage:** 40%
**Current XP:** 30 → Stage 1
Initial response showed clear intuitive understanding of bias direction and causal logic, but no use of formula or symbolic expression.
**Recommend introducing:** Covariance formula for bias, generalization to multiple regressors.
**Recommend revisiting:** Structural derivation of OVB.
