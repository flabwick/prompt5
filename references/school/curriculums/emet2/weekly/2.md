**Unit 1: The Sample Average and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**

**Concepts and Ideas:**

* Definition and properties of the sample average $\bar{Y}$
* Randomness of $\bar{Y}$ due to sampling
* Parameters of $\bar{Y}$:

  * $\mathbb{E}[\bar{Y}] = \mu$
  * $\text{Var}(\bar{Y}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$
  * Standard deviation $\sigma_{\bar{Y}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
* Approximate normality of $\bar{Y}$ under CLT
* Exact normality of $\bar{Y}$ if $Y_i \sim \mathcal{N}$
* CLT applicability regardless of population distribution
* Conditions: IID sample, large enough $n$

**Methods You’re Expected to Use:**

* Identify when CLT applies
* Compute expected value and variance of sample average
* Approximate distribution of $\bar{Y}$ as $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$
* Use standardized form: $Z = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
* Understand practical implications of CLT using histograms/simulations

**Non-Required / Off-Syllabus:**

* Knowledge of PDFs for exponential, logistic, gamma, binomial
* Analytical derivation of CLT
* Proofs of convergence

**Visuals and Diagrams Required:**

* Histogram of sample averages from non-normal distributions
* Overlay of normal curve on histogram
* CLT simulation: convergence of sample averages from exponential to normal
* Distribution of $\bar{Y}$ for $n = 5, 30, 100$

**Unit 2: Hypothesis Testing Using the CLT**

**Concepts and Ideas:**

* Hypothesis testing framework:

  * Null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$
  * Alternative hypothesis $H_A: \mu \neq \mu_0$
* Role of CLT in testing population mean
* Decision rules using significance level $\alpha = 0.05$
* Rejection region based on standard normal:

  * $\left| \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \right| > 1.96 \Rightarrow \text{Reject } H_0$
* Probabilistic interpretation of test results

**Methods You’re Expected to Use:**

* Construct test statistic using sample mean and known/estimated variance
* Determine rejection region using 5% two-tailed critical values
* Apply test to real-world scenario (e.g. bus arrival time)
* Understand distribution under the null hypothesis

**Non-Required / Off-Syllabus:**

* One-tailed tests
* p-value computation
* Testing variance or higher moments
* Alternative significance levels (e.g. 0.01 or 0.10)

**Visuals and Diagrams Required:**

* Normal distribution curve centered at $\mu_0$
* Highlighted critical regions at 2.5% in tails
* Sample mean location plotted against null distribution
* Labelled confidence interval vs. observed sample mean

**Unit 3: Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean**

**Concepts and Ideas:**

* Definition: range of values for $\mu$ that would not be rejected at 5% significance
* Confidence interval formula (population variance known):

  * $\bar{Y} \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
* Confidence interval with estimated variance:

  * $\bar{Y} \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}$
* Standard error $SE(\bar{Y}) = \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}$
* Interpretation: intervals where true mean plausibly lies
* Use in determining consistency of hypothesized mean

**Methods You’re Expected to Use:**

* Compute sample mean and sample standard deviation
* Calculate standard error from sample data
* Construct confidence interval using $\bar{Y}$ and $SE(\bar{Y})$
* Use interval to evaluate consistency of hypothesized mean

**Non-Required / Off-Syllabus:**

* Use of t-distribution (z critical value used instead)
* Confidence intervals for medians, variances
* Adjusted intervals for small samples

**Visuals and Diagrams Required:**

* Number line showing confidence interval centered on sample mean
* Normal curve with shaded 95% region
* Visual indication of whether hypothesized mean lies inside or outside the interval

**Unit 4: Estimators, Estimates, and Desirable Estimator Properties**

**Concepts and Ideas:**

* Estimator: function/procedure to calculate a parameter from data
* Estimate: numerical outcome from applying an estimator
* Properties:

  * Bias: $\mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta}] - \theta$
  * Unbiasedness: $\mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta}] = \theta$
  * Variance of estimator
* Efficiency / Minimum variance among unbiased estimators
* BLUE: Best Linear Unbiased Estimator

  * Ȳ is BLUE for population mean under Gauss-Markov theorem
* Examples of bad estimators:

  * Tallest value in sample
  * Constant (e.g. 42)
  * Gender-specific subgroup averages

**Methods You’re Expected to Use:**

* Identify bias and variance from estimator definition
* Derive expected value and variance of weighted sample means
* Compare estimators using theoretical properties
* Prove sample mean has minimum variance among linear unbiased estimators

**Non-Required / Off-Syllabus:**

* Non-linear estimators
* Maximum likelihood estimation
* Asymptotic properties
* Estimators for non-mean parameters

**Visuals and Diagrams Required:**

* Histograms of estimates from repeated sampling
* Overlayed histograms showing bias or centering at true mean
* Table comparing variances of alternative estimators
* Visual derivation of variance of weighted average

**Unit 5: Confidence Intervals for Differences in Means**

**Concepts and Ideas:**

* Two-sample inference setup:

  * Two independent samples $Y_0, Y_1$
  * Objective: infer difference in population means $\mu_1 - \mu_0$
* Estimator: $\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_0$
* Standard error of difference:

  * $SE(\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_0) = \sqrt{ \frac{S_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{S_0^2}{n_0} }$
* Confidence interval:

  * $(\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_0) \pm 1.96 \cdot SE(\bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_0)$
* Use in testing treatment effects, intervention outcomes

**Methods You’re Expected to Use:**

* Compute sample means and variances for two groups

* Interval plotted around observed difference
* Highlight of whether 0 is within confidence interval for difference
