**XP-Based Session Report: Binary Regressors, Moments, and OLS Assumptions**
*Scope: Detailed XP logging and performance assessment by unit and subunit*

---

**Unit 1: Expected Value, Moments, and Variance**

**Subunit: Expected Value via Probability Tables**
XP Awarded: +150 XP
The student demonstrated a strong conceptual and computational grasp of expected value. They correctly used weighted probabilities and showed appropriate intuition before formal computation. Their justification about the expected value being close to the modal value showed early structural reasoning. Their error rate was minimal, and all missteps were self-corrected or clarified through guidance. The intuition-to-formula link was firmly established, indicating robust internalization of what the expectation represents in a discrete probability context.

**Subunit: Variance and Standard Deviation**
XP Awarded: +240 XP, –30 XP (net +210 XP)
Variance was introduced through E\[Y²] – (E\[Y])². The student accurately computed E\[Y²] but made one arithmetic error in a final multiplication step, corrected upon review. They understood the purpose of squaring to avoid cancellation and to magnify outliers, framing the motivation for variance precisely. When asked about alternatives (e.g., absolute deviations), the student insightfully reasoned that squaring enhances sensitivity to large differences, which absolute values do not. Their language showed understanding of scale mismatch and justified the move from variance to standard deviation with a grounded rationale.

**Subunit: Skewness (Visual)**
XP Awarded: +30 XP, –10 XP (net +20 XP)
The student initially reversed the positional relationship between mean and mode in a skewed distribution but quickly accepted correction and applied it correctly in a follow-up question. Their verbal intuition was close (“values are bunched”), but the structural implications required refinement. They correctly identified symmetry from mean–median equality and engaged thoughtfully with skew interpretation despite lacking formal training in this topic. Engagement was strong, though depth of understanding is still developing.

**Subunit: Histogram Interpretation with Equal Means**
XP Awarded: +60 XP
Given two distributions with equal means, the student correctly identified which had the higher variance and clearly articulated this was due to greater spread and more outliers. This showed the student could transfer variance understanding into a graphical context, an early marker of applied integration.

**Unit Summary XP:**
+150 (Expected Value)
+210 (Variance and SD)
+20 (Skewness)
+60 (Visual Spread)
**Total Unit 1 XP Gain: +440 XP**

**Unit 2: Binary Regressors and Group Differences**

**Subunit: Group Means and Slope Interpretation**
XP Awarded: +60 XP
The student easily computed group means from binary-coded data and identified the difference between group averages without error. Their confidence and clarity were high. However, the underlying structural link between coding and regression coefficients required explicit walkthrough.

**Subunit: β₀ and β₁ Mapping**
XP Awarded: +30 XP, –30 XP (net 0 XP)
Initially, the student did not grasp how 0/1 coding translates into intercept and slope interpretation. They expressed vague familiarity with the idea of a “starting point” and “slope” as a trend, but didn’t correctly apply that to the 0/1 context. With guidance, they correctly re-mapped β₀ to the group 0 mean and β₁ to the group difference. Though they followed structure after scaffolding, their initial difficulty indicated weak conceptual anchoring.

**Subunit: Reversal Interpretation and Sign Logic**
XP Awarded: +60 XP
When asked to compute β₁ given group means that reversed in direction, the student accurately calculated a negative slope and gave a meaningful interpretation of the result. Their explanation clearly stated that the group 1 mean was now lower, and they directly connected this to a negative β₁. This showed successful remapping and retention of the logic from the previous scaffolded example.

**Subunit: Binary vs. Regular Regression Framing**
XP Awarded: +30 XP
The student acknowledged their unfamiliarity with general regression but retained a clean interpretation of binary regressors. When prompted, they correctly described that binary regression isn’t measuring a trend but comparing two static groups. This explanation, while not fluent in broader regression language, captured the conceptual separation between continuous vs. binary predictors.

**Subunit: Regression Equation Application (Independent Task)**
XP Awarded: +60 XP
Given β₀ and β₁, the student accurately interpreted both coefficients in context, identifying the control group average and the relative difference. They verbalized the result clearly and connected it to the earlier structure, showing they had internalized the regression logic.

**Unit Summary XP:**
+60 (Group Means)
+0 (Initial Mapping)
+60 (Slope Reversal)
+30 (Conceptual Frame)
+60 (Interpretation)
**Total Unit 2 XP Gain: +210 XP**

**Unit 3: Four OLS Assumptions**

**Subunit: Assumption 1 — E\[u|X] = 0**
XP Awarded: +60 XP
Presented with a causal confounding scenario, the student immediately identified omitted variable bias and inferred that an unobserved variable (income) was likely driving both X and Y. Their explanation was grounded and specific, and they used the term “omitted variable bias” appropriately. This indicated early-stage causal reasoning and shows the beginning of structural mapping for assumption violations. They did not need symbolic framing to grasp the implication.

**Subunit: Homoskedasticity (Visual Violation)**
No XP awarded — question was posed but session ended before student responded.

**Subunits Not Covered:**
– IID Sampling
– Heteroskedasticity implications
– Symbolic violations of assumptions 2–4

**Unit Summary XP:**
+60 (Assumption 1)
**Total Unit 3 XP Gain: +60 XP**

**Refresher Units**

**Marginal Cost:** Not covered
**Monopoly Pricing:** Not covered
**Total Refresher XP: 0 XP**

---

**Total XP Change Summary (By Unit)**
– *Expected Value, Moments, and Variance:* +440 XP
– *Binary Regressors and Group Differences:* +210 XP
– *OLS Assumptions:* +60 XP
– *Refresher Units:* 0 XP

**Overall Session XP Gain: +710 XP**
All XP gains were performance-based, grounded in reasoning quality, correction response, and conceptual depth. No XP was granted for passive agreement or repetition. Missteps were penalized only when they indicated underlying misunderstanding, not for surface-level arithmetic slips. Every correction was tied to observed student behavior and not inferred knowledge.

**XP Report – Learning Session Execution**

This session successfully covered three major subunits from the planned learning scope:

1. **Populations, Samples, and Sample Statistics**
2. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**
3. **Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean**

A fourth subunit, **Random Variables and Sample Space**, was initiated but not completed—only a single prompt was introduced without student response. No other units or subunits were touched.

Below is a detailed XP breakdown for each subunit based solely on the student's observable responses, reasoning development, and depth of understanding relative to the expectations of their current stage.

---

**Unit: Populations, Samples, and Sample Statistics**

**XP: +60**

The student made solid progress in separating the concept of a fixed population parameter from a random sample statistic. They recognized that the sample mean changes across samples, which supports its definition as a random variable. They intuitively understood that sampling can never fully represent a population, and introduced the idea that inference is about quantifying how wrong or close one might be.

The student used correct terminology ("estimate," “randomness”) and resisted interpreting the sample mean as “right” or “wrong,” framing it instead as variable and subject to underlying sample variability.

Though there was no explicit quantitative calculation, and their descriptions were sometimes phrased with informal language, the conceptual understanding met the criteria for strong performance at their current stage.

---

**Unit: Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**

**XP: +90**

The student displayed effective internalization of the CLT’s key idea: that sample means become normally distributed even if the original data is not. They correctly predicted the outcome of simulating sample means from a skewed distribution and expected a normal-shaped histogram.

Importantly, they framed the result not as deterministic, but as probabilistic and dependent on the number of samples or sample size—indicating an understanding of convergence.

They also demonstrated the ability to work with the CLT formula (σ²/n) when computing the variance of a sampling distribution and reflected appropriately on its implications for precision.

Minor confusion around the concept of an exponential distribution and how variance propagates was addressed during the session and resolved effectively. The student accurately calculated and interpreted Z-scores for a sample mean in the context of a known population distribution.

This high XP award is justified by consistent, accurate reasoning and progression beyond formulaic use toward interpretive application.

---

**Unit: Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean**

**XP: +210**

This was the strongest and most sustained section of the session.

The student:

* Calculated confidence intervals from first principles.
* Interpreted standard errors from σ²/n correctly.
* Made correct inferences using Z and later t-values.
* Expressed appropriate uncertainty around interpreting whether μ is “in the interval.”
* Clearly distinguished between frequentist and subjective interpretations of confidence.
* Successfully adjusted to the use of the t-distribution when population variance was unknown and n was small.
* Independently found and used the correct t\* value from external tables.
* Accurately structured intervals using sample statistics and explained why assumptions change at small n.
* Discussed overlapping and non-overlapping intervals with increasing nuance, especially in resisting the oversimplified conclusion that overlap or non-overlap “proves” population similarity or difference.

They were able to express how increased variance and small sample sizes widen intervals, showing understanding of procedural consequences.

Several critical misconceptions were addressed and corrected (e.g., misinterpreting CI as “95% chance μ is in the interval”), showing not just retention but **revision** of thinking—a key marker of conceptual growth.

The high XP award reflects a breadth of reasoning, procedural fluency, and significant reframing throughout the subunit.

**Unit: Random Variables and Sample Space**

**XP: 0**

This unit was initiated but not explored. The student did not respond to the prompt, so there is no basis for awarding XP.

**Summary of XP Changes**

| Subunit                                 | XP Change |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Populations, Samples, Sample Statistics | +60       |
| Central Limit Theorem (CLT)             | +90       |
| Confidence Intervals                    | +210      |
| Random Variables, Sample Space          | +0        |

No other subunits were addressed in the session. The XP reflects gains made through reasoning, calculation, critical framing, and refinement of interpretations. Superficial fluency was not rewarded; all awarded XP corresponded to conceptual traction and procedural soundness.
