**Session Plan: Deep Dive into Moral Hazard, Natural Monopoly, and Multi-Period Intertemporal Choice**

**Scope Selection:**

Chosen scope:

* *Moral hazard and adverse selection*
* *Natural monopolies and duopoly inefficiency*
* *Multi-period intertemporal models (Euler, CRRA)*

**Justification:**
These topics are listed as completely *uncovered* in Section 0. Each represents a distinct conceptual framework (asymmetric information, cost structures, dynamic utility), enabling cognitive separation and preventing overload. Additionally, all three are exam-relevant and tightly connected to policy debates (e.g., insurance, market design, retirement savings).

**Session Structure:**

**I. Diagnostic Challenge Exercise (Desirable Difficulty)**

*Prompt:*
*A household is deciding between buying two health insurance plans. Plan A is cheaper but covers fewer conditions; Plan B is expensive but more comprehensive. Assume all households are identical in income but differ in health risk—information not observable to insurers. A new firm enters the market offering a universal flat-rate Plan C with full coverage but starts losing money rapidly.*

**Tasks:**

1. *Why might Plan C be unprofitable despite flat pricing and identical income?*
2. *What form of inefficiency may now arise in the market?*
3. *Explain whether this outcome can be avoided in a two-period world with declining marginal utility and savings.*
4. *Sketch what happens to firm average cost when two firms split a natural monopoly market with fixed cost F.*
5. *Write down the intertemporal utility maximization condition assuming log utility and interest rate r.*

This diagnostic probes:

* Selection effects → **adverse selection**
* Behavioral shifts under coverage → **moral hazard**
* Firm cost structures under output splitting → **natural monopoly**
* Euler equation logic with **log utility**
* **Marginal utility equalization over time** → intertemporal choice

**II. Instructional Phase**

**A. Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection**

* *Conceptual Distinction:*

  * **Adverse selection** = hidden types (ex ante); selection into insurance market.
  * **Moral hazard** = hidden actions (ex post); behavior changes after contract.

* *Required reasoning:*

  * Explain why full insurance can *increase* accident probability.
  * Show why *high-risk types* drive up premiums under pooled pricing.
  * Use **utility curves** (concave) and **certainty equivalents** to show why **risk-averse agents** may still reject fair insurance if selection effects distort pricing.

* *Methods:*

  * Compute EU and CE for two risk types.
  * Explain market unraveling graphically or logically (spiral premium effects).
  * Introduce **feasible region** in two-good model.

**B. Natural Monopoly and Duopoly Inefficiency**

* *Conceptual Focus:*

  * High **fixed costs**, **declining AC**, efficient provision by **single firm**.
  * Duopoly implies **duplicated fixed costs**, lower Q → higher AC per firm.

* *Required Graphs:*

  * One firm: MR = MC → Q₁, P₁; AC(Q₁) < P₁
  * Two firms: each Q = Q₁/2; show AC ↑, P ↓, profits → negative

* *Key Equation:*

  * AC(Q) = FC/Q + VC(Q)/Q

* *Decision Rule:*

  * If AC₁(Q₁) < AC₂(Q₂), monopolization is cost-efficient.

---

**C. Multi-Period Intertemporal Models**

* *Core Setup:*

  * Time-separable utility: U = u(C₁) + δ·u(C₂)
  * Budget: C₁ + C₂/(1 + r) = I
  * **Log utility** → u′(C) = 1/C

* *Euler Equation:*

  * 1/C₁ = δ(1 + r)·1/C₂ → C₂ = δ(1 + r)·C₁

* *Solving Strategy:*

  1. Use Euler equation to express C₂ in terms of C₁
  2. Plug into budget constraint
  3. Solve exact values (numerical version)

* *Comparative Statics:*

  * δ ↑ → stronger future preference → C₂ ↑, C₁ ↓
  * r ↑ → future consumption cheaper → substitution effect: C₂ ↑

**III. Spontaneous Knowledge Prompts (Spaced Recall)**

Interleaved throughout session:

1. **“Draw an indifference curve map for perfect substitutes and mark the MRS.”**
   → Test reinforcement of earlier gap.

2. **“What does the sign of cross-price elasticity tell you about two goods?”**
   → Reinforce untested concept from elasticity topic.

3. **“Explain why convexity of preferences implies a diminishing MRS.”**
   → Reconnect with foundational assumptions.

4. **“What’s the difference between compensating and equivalent variation?”**
   → Hit an uncovered welfare topic.

**End-of-Session Wrap**

*Final Quick-Fire Tasks:*

* Sketch a natural monopoly with and without a regulatory price ceiling at MC.
* Write the optimal consumption condition under CRRA utility.
* Describe, in one sentence, why moral hazard increases with full insurance.
