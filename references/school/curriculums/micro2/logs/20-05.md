**Session XP Report — Foundational Consumer Theory (Units 1–4)**

This report evaluates XP changes based strictly on the student’s *own inputs* during the session. The analysis reflects their demonstrated understanding and performance relative to each subunit. Only explicitly addressed material has been included. No inference has been made from the tutor’s input alone, and no assumptions have been made about uncovered content.

**Unit 1: Preferences and Indifference Curves**

*Subunit: Completeness and Transitivity*
The student demonstrated a strong conceptual understanding of transitivity and preference loops. They articulated how intransitivity undermines rational decision-making and identified its implications in real-world trade scenarios, such as the potential for a consumer to be exploited through preference cycles. The student was able to connect these preference conditions to the shapes and directionality of indifference curves, recognizing visual contradictions as signals of intransitivity.
**+90 XP** (1 stage above current)

*Subunit: Indifference Curve Shapes and Types of Preferences*
The student successfully classified perfect substitutes, perfect complements, bads, and useless goods based on curve shape and behavioral implications. Descriptions were precise, and the reasoning demonstrated both recognition of visual cues and behavioral consequences. The student was also able to interpret skewed indifference curves and correctly associated them with Cobb-Douglas preferences, articulating the implications of a high MRS and skewed substitution behavior.

**Unit 2: Utility Functions (Ordinal Only)**

*Subunit: Ordinal Utility and Utility Function Equivalence*
The student was initially unsure how to construct utility functions from indifference curves but recovered quickly. Once guided, they correctly identified utility functions consistent with perfect substitutes (e.g., U = A + B) and explained how changes to these (e.g., U = 2A + 2B) preserved ordinal preferences. They made effective use of example bundles to check preference consistency and grasped that utility values are meaningless except for ranking.

When asked about transformations like logs and squares, they provided mixed reasoning. The student correctly reasoned that logs preserve order for positive values, but initially misunderstood their impact on marginal utility and curve shape. They were later able to reframe and identify that functions like ln(A + B) or A² + B² preserved ranking and thus reflected the same preferences. The student's initial framing was fuzzy, but their final generalization—that same preferences arise from monotonic transformations—was complete and accurate.

**Unit 3: Marginal Utility and MRS**

*Subunit: Marginal Utility*
The student initially showed confusion between total and marginal utility and between variables and partial derivatives. Their notation was incorrect at first, but when asked to revise their thinking, they quickly corrected and accurately computed partial derivatives from a Cobb-Douglas function (U = AB). Once clarified, they consistently applied correct MU logic: MU\_A = B, MU\_B = A.
**+30 XP** (strong at current stage)

*Subunit: MRS Computation and Interpretation*
The student made an initial reversal error (stating MRS = MU\_B / MU\_A) but caught and corrected it. They then applied the MRS = MU\_A / MU\_B formula and interpreted it in a behavioral context, noting how many units of B a consumer would give up for an extra unit of A. This interpretation was initially vague but became precise and aligned with theory once reinforced. When asked about how MRS changes as A increases, they correctly identified that MRS falls and explained this as diminishing willingness to substitute B for additional A.

**Unit 4: Budget Constraints**

*Subunit: Graphing the Budget Line*
The student set up and manipulated the budget equation correctly to find intercepts and isolate variables. They showed full understanding of how to interpret the intercepts graphically. When prompted to determine the slope, they demonstrated clear reasoning and re-derived the slope accurately from the equation form. They explicitly tied the slope to trade-off meaning.
**+60 XP** (1 stage above current)

*Subunit: Slope as Price Ratio and Comparison to MRS*
The student recognized the connection between MRS and price ratio as a condition for optimal choice. They acknowledged that the slope of the budget line represents the price ratio, and when MRS equals this slope, the consumer is at an optimal point. The insight was initially tentative but self-generated and confirmed.
**+30 XP** (strong at current stage)

**General Observations**
The student’s performance showed consistent upward correction, reframing, and synthesis. Where misunderstandings occurred, they were generally self-repaired with minimal prompting. They did not fall into fluency traps and showed restraint in areas of uncertainty. Their growth was strongest in conceptual integration (Units 1 and 3), and their explanations showed increasing independence and precision as the session progressed.

Units not explicitly covered beyond this point (e.g., income/price change effects on constraints, constrained optimization, comparative statics) have not been evaluated.
