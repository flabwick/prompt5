**Likely Exam Question Types: Natural Monopoly & Regulation**

---

**1. Diagram-Based Analysis**

*“Draw a cost diagram of a natural monopoly. Indicate MC, ATC, and demand. Show the socially efficient output and the monopoly output. Shade the deadweight loss.”*

→ You must:
- Accurately label MC, downward-sloping ATC, demand, MR
- Show monopoly output: MR = MC → price from D
- Show efficient output: P = MC → Q*
- Shade DWL triangle between Qm and Q*

---

**2. Regulation Trade-off**

*“Explain, with diagrams, the implications of imposing a price ceiling at marginal cost in a natural monopoly. Discuss whether this outcome is sustainable.”*

→ Expect to:
- Draw price ceiling at MC
- Show zero/negative profit if P < ATC
- Explain firm exit risk
- Possibly calculate required subsidy:  
  \( \text{Subsidy} = (\text{ATC} - \text{MC}) \times Q^* \)

**3. Numerical Application**

*“A firm has FC = 1000, VC = 2Q. Demand: P = 10 – 0.5Q.  
Find: a) Monopoly Q, P, profit  
  b) Efficient Q, P  
  c) Size of subsidy required to induce Q*.”*

→ You must:
- Set MR = MC to find monopoly Q
- Use P(Q), ATC(Q) to compute profit
- For P = MC, solve for Q*
- Find difference between ATC and MC at Q*
- Multiply difference by Q* to get total subsidy

---

**4. Argumentative / Conceptual**

*“Why does a natural monopoly justify government intervention? Explain using cost structure and efficiency criteria.”*

→ Requires:
- Define natural monopoly
- Show conflict between cost efficiency and pricing efficiency
- Discuss DWL, firm losses, and subsidy logic
- Reference trade-offs: allocative efficiency vs. fiscal cost

---

**5. Compare Scenarios**

*“Compare outcomes under:  
a) Monopoly without regulation  
b) Price ceiling at P = MC  
c) Price ceiling at P = ATC  
Use diagrams and explain efficiency and sustainability in each.”*

→ Structure matters:
- Draw each case cleanly
- Identify CS, PS, DWL
- Discuss: which is efficient, which is sustainable, which needs subsidy
