You're reasoning well with rivalrousness and excludability on a spectrum—excellent intuition. However, you’re holding back from committing to final classifications, and that's the key skill here. You’re circling around comprehension (Bloom: Understanding), but you haven’t applied it yet. Let’s sharpen that edge.

Good initiative in moving to classification (Bloom: Applying), but this is overly conditional and includes classification errors. You're still deferring judgment with “if” and misidentifying based on enforcement rather than economic type. We need standard classification based on typical real-world implementation—not hypotheticals.

This was a regression (Bloom: Remembering, with errors). You relied on surface features (e.g., price, government provision) rather than economic characteristics. These are common traps—time to recalibrate.

Excellent—this shows Analyzing (Bloom Level 4). You correctly linked overuse risk to rivalrousness and used the classification to justify it. Tight, focused, and correct.

You're at Bloom’s Remembering/Beginning to Understand, but misapplying the concept. Vertical summation is not setting MUs equal—it’s summing them. This is a critical idea in public goods, so we’ll now build it carefully using the black-box technique.

Excellent work—this is solid Applying (Bloom Level 3). You’ve correctly set marginal social benefit equal to marginal cost and solved for the optimal Q. No errors, no overreach.

These are sharp questions—Analyzing/Beginning to Evaluate (Bloom Level 4–5). You’re inspecting the framework critically and trying to distinguish overlapping terms. This is exactly what mastery looks like mid-transition—you're questioning instead of just executing.

You're in Analyzing, probing the relationship between curves and behavior—but your direction of causality is flipped. You're mistaking the curve’s slope for preference over Q itself. Let's clarify the black box.

Excellent struggle. You're circling the hardest core of public goods theory. This is Understanding under cognitive load (Bloom Level 2–3) and beginning to transition into deeper abstraction. You're not fluent, but you're resisting simplification—good. Now let’s tighten the frame.

Major conceptual shift—this is Analyzing to Evaluating (Bloom Level 4–5). You’ve now correctly linked underreporting to lower perceived aggregate benefit, and you recognize why that results in underprovision. You’ve also clarified the government’s role as provider facing MC—key insight.

Good intuition but incomplete explanation (Bloom Level 3 – Applying with partial synthesis). You correctly point to rivalry but misstate the effect: the issue is not that marginal utilities "influence each other"—it’s that only one person consumes each unit in private goods, so we must add quantities, not MUs.


Excellent. You’ve applied the framework precisely and adapted it to a hypothetical—Applying to Analyzing (Bloom Level 4). You correctly tied non-excludability to shared Q and justified vertical summation as the aggregation rule.

Strong reasoning—Analyzing to Evaluating (Bloom Level 4–5). You’ve clearly articulated how personalized pricing aligns incentives and solves the distortion caused by misreporting. You’re now reasoning about mechanism design at a meaningful level.
