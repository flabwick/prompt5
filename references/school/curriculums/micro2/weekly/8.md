**3. Lecture Content: Core Economic Concepts**

  

**Consumption vs Production**

- **Consumers**:
    
    - Maximise utility within income constraints (credit-constrained)
        
    - Risk-averse
        
    - Value goods via money
        
    
- **Producers**:
    
    - Maximise profit = revenue – cost
        
    - Constrained by production costs (not credit)
        
    - Assumed risk-neutral (linear utility)
        
    - Value money directly
        
    

  

**Firm Structure Assumptions**

- Firm as a single profit-maximising entity
    
- Ignores:
    
    - Worker effort minimisation
        
    - Internal promotions/dynamics
        
    - Principal-agent problems
        
    
- These topics fall under organisational economics (excluded from course)

**4. Profit Maximisation**

  

**Conceptual**

- Profit = Revenue – Cost
    
- Optimum at: MR = MC
    
- Graphical Representations:
    
    - Total Revenue vs Total Cost (profit = vertical gap)
        
    - MR vs MC (intersection = optimal quantity Q*)
        
    

  

**Equational**

- π(Q) = R(Q) – C(Q)
    
- dπ/dQ = MR – MC = 0 → MR = MC
    
- MR = d(P(Q)·Q)/dQ via product rule
    

  

**Revenue and Marginal Revenue**

- Revenue = P(Q) × Q
    
- MR = d(P(Q)×Q)/dQ = dP/dQ × Q + P
    
- Competitive Firms: dP/dQ = 0 → MR = P
    
- Monopolies: dP/dQ < 0 → MR < P
    

  

**Elasticity Connection**

- MR = P × (1 + 1/ε)
    
    - ε = –∞ → MR = P (perfect competition)
        
    - ε < –1 → MR > 0
        
    - ε > –1 → MR < 0 (should reduce output)
        
    

  

**Demand and MR Examples**

- **Generic Demand**:
    
    - E.g., P = Q^–2/3 → MR = (1/3)·Q^–2/3
        
    
- **Linear Demand**:
    
    - P = A – BQ → R = AQ – BQ² → MR = A – 2BQ

**5. Voting Systems and Social Choice Theory**

  

**Context**

- Special focus in place of auction theory due to federal election
    
- Objective: Evaluate voting rules using mechanism design and social welfare theory
    

  

**Core Concepts**

- **Mechanism Design**: Create systems to achieve desirable social outcomes
    
- **Social Welfare Function (SWF)**: Aggregates individual preferences
    
- **Desirable SWF Properties**:
    
    - _Pareto Efficiency_
        
    - _Pairwise Independence_ (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives)
        
    - _Condorcet Winner_ concept
        
    

  

**Voting Systems**

1. **Dictatorship**
    
    - Follows one voter’s preferences
        
    - Satisfies Pareto and pairwise independence
        
    - Unfair by design
        
    
2. **Borda Count**
    
    - Ranks via points based on position
        
    - More balanced than dictatorship
        
    - Violates pairwise independence; vulnerable to irrelevant alternatives
        
    
3. **First-Past-the-Post (FPTP)**
    
    - Only first preferences matter
        
    - Prone to strategic voting; ignores broader preferences
        
    - May elect Condorcet losers
        
    
4. **Single Transferable Vote (STV)**
    
    - Rank-based elimination until one gets majority
        
    - Reduces strategic voting; avoids Condorcet losers
        
    - Doesn’t always elect Condorcet winners
        
    
5. **Two-Round Voting**
    
    - Top 2 candidates from round one go to runoff
        
    - Better than FPTP, but still strategically manipulable
        
    
6. **Mixed Member Proportional (MMP)**
    
    - Combines district-based and proportional representation
        
    - Used in Germany, NZ
        
    - Balances representation and fairness; well-regarded
        
    

  

**Key Theorems**

- **Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem**
    
    - No SWF can satisfy Pareto, pairwise independence, and non-dictatorship with 3+ options
        
    
- **Gibbard–Satterthwaite Theorem**
    
    - Every non-dictatorial, deterministic voting system with 3+ options is manipulable
        
    

  

**Conclusion on Voting Systems**

- No perfect system
    
- Trade-offs between fairness, strategy-resistance, practicality
    
- Australia’s preferential system is robust but not flawless
