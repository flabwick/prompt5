**Unit 1: Elasticity of Demand**

  

**Core Concepts and Ideas:**

• Own-price elasticity of demand: %ΔQx / %ΔPx.

• Cross-price elasticity of demand: %ΔQx / %ΔPy.

• Income elasticity of demand: %ΔQx / %ΔI.

• Elasticity as a general measure: percentage change in one variable relative to another.

• Price ratio elasticity of demand: %ΔQx / %Δ(Px/Py) (optional).

• Constant elasticity from Cobb-Douglas utility: own-price elasticity = -1.

• Relationship between demand functions and income/price shares.

• Elasticity via derivatives:

• Own-price: dQx/dPx × (Px/Qx).

• Cross-price: dQx/dPy × (Py/Qx).

• Income: dQx/dI × (I/Qx).

• Logarithmic forms of elasticity.

• Zero cross-price elasticity interpretation.

• Elasticities linked to expenditure shares.

  

**Methods Required:**

• Partial differentiation.

• Substitution into elasticity formulas.

• Algebraic simplifications.

• Using demand functions (e.g., Qx = 0.4I/Px).

• Derivatives with respect to price/income.

• Conceptual understanding of elasticity.

  

**Visuals/Graphs:**

• Optional chart of elasticity formulas.

• Optional flow diagram of elasticity types.

  

**Excluded/Non-required Topics:**

**Unit 2: Choice Under Uncertainty and Expected Utility**

  

**Core Concepts and Ideas:**

• Definition of certainty vs uncertainty.

• Gambles (lotteries) to illustrate uncertainty.

• Frequentist vs subjective probability (treated equally).

• Expected value: EV = Σpi·xi.

• Expected utility: EU = Σpi·U(xi).

• Utility functions: U(W) maps wealth to utility.

• Certainty Equivalent (CE): value giving same utility as EU.

• Risk premium = EV - CE.

• Utility of expected value ≠ expected utility.

• Fair gambles: EV = initial outlay.

• Risk attitudes:

• Risk-averse: CE < EV → concave U(W).

• Risk-neutral: CE = EV → linear U(W).

• Risk-loving: CE > EV → convex U(W).

• Use of EU to explain real-world decision-making.

  

**Methods Required:**

• EV: weighted average of outcomes.

• EU: apply utility function then weight.

• CE: solve U(CE) = EU → CE = U^-1(EU).

• Use utility functions (e.g., ln(W), √W).

• Graphical and algebraic comparison of EU vs EV.

• Identify risk preference from utility shape and CE vs EV.

  

**Visuals/Graphs Required:**

• Utility curve (x-axis = wealth, y-axis = utility):

• Mark EU, CE, EV, utility of EV.

• U(W) shapes: concave (risk-averse), linear (risk-neutral), convex (risk-loving).

• Gamble table: probabilities, outcomes, EV, EU, CE.

  

**Excluded/Non-required Topics:**

• Ambiguity aversion, Knightian uncertainty.

• Non-EU models (prospect theory, maximin, etc.).

• EV for continuous distributions.

• Utility over non-monetary outcomes.

**Unit 3: Two-Good Model of Uncertainty**

  

**Core Concepts and Ideas:**

• States of the world = goods in micro setup.

• Bundles: (wealth in state 1, wealth in state 2).

• Certainty line: 45° line (equal wealth).

• Indifference curves for risky preferences.

• Bowed-in indifference curves = risk aversion.

  

**Methods Required:**

• Construct/analyze two-good diagrams.

• Determine location relative to certainty line.

• Use symmetry and convexity of preferences.

• Map EU into indifference curves.

  

**Visuals Required:**

• Two-good graph:

• Axes = wealth in states 1 and 2.

• Certainty line.

• Iso-expected value lines.

• Indifference curves.

• Label uninsured, fully insured, partial insured, EV, actuarially fair point.

  

**Excluded/Non-required Topics:**

• Changing probability weights.

• Consumption-based bundles.

**Unit 4: Insurance under Uncertainty (Utility and Two-Good Models)**

  

**Core Concepts and Ideas:**

• Insurance = wealth transfer across states.

• Premium paid always; payout conditional.

• Full vs partial insurance.

• Fair insurance: preserves EV.

• Unfair insurance: EV reduced, utility may rise.

• Feasible insurance region: between certainty and iso-EV line.

• Infeasible: insurer loses or consumer rejects.

• Profit-maximizing contract: tangency of indifference curve and lowest iso-EV line.

• Slope matching: full insurance is optimal.

  

**Methods Required:**

• Compare utility of insured vs gamble.

• Assess CE and premiums.

• Identify offers on two-good graph.

• Determine fair/unfair, partial/full combinations.

• Use slope logic for optimization.

  

**Visuals Required:**

• U(W) graph with insurance outcomes.

• Two-good diagram:

• Certainty line.

• Iso-EV lines.

• Indifference curves.

• Labeled points: U, FF, unfair bundles, optimal point.

• Feasible vs infeasible zones.

**Unit 5: Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection**

  

**Core Concepts and Ideas:**

• Moral Hazard:

• Behavioral response to being insured.

• Reduces care, raises risk.

• Full insurance → more moral hazard.

• Not modeled explicitly; probabilities fixed.

• Adverse Selection:

• High-risk individuals self-select.

• Private info on risk type.

• Leads to rising premiums, market collapse.

• Distinct from moral hazard: selection vs behavior.

  

**Methods Required:**

• Qualitative reasoning with examples.

• Logical analysis of market dynamics.

  

**Visuals (Optional):**

• Timeline or decision tree for moral hazard.

• Spiral or layered demand curve for adverse selection.

**Unit 6: Empirical Utility Functions**

  

**Core Concepts and Ideas:**

• Log utility: U(W) = ln(W).

• Square root utility: U(W) = √W.

**Unit 7: Comparing EV and EU Frameworks**

  

**Core Concepts and Ideas:**

• EV: simple, lacks realism.
