**UNIT 1: ASSESSMENT CONTEXT AND EXAM REVIEW**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

**UNIT 2: PRODUCTION THEORY AND INPUT CHOICE**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Firms aim to maximise profit: revenue − cost.

• Production as transformation of inputs (capital and labour) into output (widgets).

• Modelled as Q = F(K, L), with K = capital (machine hours), L = labour (human hours).

• Only two inputs modelled, no intermediate goods or multi-product firms.

• Isoquants: combinations of K and L that produce same Q.

• Isoquant maps: Q = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

• Substitutability:

• Perfect substitutes: straight isoquants.

• Perfect complements: L-shaped isoquants.

• Cobb-Douglas: smooth, convex isoquants.

• MRTS = -MPL/MPK = - (dQ/dL) / (dQ/dK).

• Tangency between isoquants and isocosts: cost minimisation condition.

• Isoquants vs. indifference curves: firm vs. consumer.

• Expansion path: locus of tangency points as output increases.

• Input price effects: w increase → less L; r increase → less K.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Plot isoquants and iso-costs.

• Calculate MRTS using partial derivatives.

• Graph isoquant-isocost diagram, identify tangency.

• Solve MRTS = w/r to derive cost-minimising bundle.

**UNIT 3: PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS AND RETURNS**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Marginal Product:

• MPK = dQ/dK; MPL = dQ/dL.

• Diminishing marginal returns: d^2Q/dK^2 < 0.

• Returns to Scale:

• All inputs increase → output response:

• Increasing: Q increases more than proportionally.

• Constant: Q increases proportionally.

• Decreasing: Q increases less than proportionally.

• Cobb-Douglas: Q = A·K^a·L^b.

• Returns to scale depend on a + b:

• 1: increasing; =1: constant; <1: decreasing.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Compute marginal products using partial derivatives.

• Determine diminishing returns via second derivatives.

• Identify returns to scale from Cobb-Douglas exponents.

• Distinguish marginal product from returns to scale.

  

**Non-Required Methods:**
