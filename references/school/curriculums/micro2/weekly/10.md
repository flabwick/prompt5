Unit 1: Monopoly and Market Structures

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Definition of monopoly: A firm that is the sole seller of a good or service.
	•	Monopoly vs. perfect competition: downward-sloping demand vs. horizontal demand.
	•	Monopolies still profit-maximize where MR = MC.
	•	Demand curve is market demand; monopolist faces entire market.
	•	Marginal revenue is below the demand curve (due to downward slope).
	•	Monopolist has price-setting power, not infinite but substantial.
	•	Market structures shift from efficient (perfect competition) to inefficient (monopoly).
	•	Entry and exit do not occur in monopolies (long-run profit persists).
	•	Inefficiencies include deadweight loss and non-minimization of average costs.

Methods Required:
	•	Draw monopoly cost and revenue diagram:
	•	Axes: Quantity (x), Price (y).
	•	Include: downward-sloping Demand (D), Marginal Revenue (MR), upward-sloping or flat Marginal Cost (MC), U-shaped Average Cost (AC).
	•	Identify profit-maximizing quantity where MR = MC.
	•	Show monopoly price from D at that quantity.
	•	Highlight profit as (P - AC) * Q.
	•	Indicate consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss.
	•	Compare monopoly outcomes to competitive outcomes:
	•	Lower quantity and higher price in monopoly.
	•	Less total surplus; identify areas lost in DWL.

Off-Syllabus/Non-Required Methods:
	•	No need for dynamic models or time-path analysis.
	•	No requirement to model entry/exit mathematically.
	•	No game theory unless specifically introduced elsewhere.

Relevant Visuals:
	•	Monopoly diagram (D, MR, MC, AC, PM, QM, profit region, CS, PS, DWL).
	•	Comparison with perfect competition (overlay competitive price/quantity).

Unit 2: Market Failure and Government Intervention

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Definition of market failure: when unregulated equilibrium is not Pareto efficient.
	•	Causes of market failure in monopolies: under-provision (Q < Q*), pricing above MC.
	•	Government roles: correct inefficiencies through taxes, subsidies, price controls, or regulation.
	•	Government may not always improve outcomes due to information gaps, incentive problems.
	•	Discussion of first-best (maximize total surplus) vs. second-best (maximize subject to constraints).
	•	Perverse incentives (e.g., moral hazard in public healthcare).
	•	Limited information and costly data acquisition as limits to policy design.

Methods Required:
	•	Understand government interventions:
	•	Price ceilings: Set P = MC; force monopoly to expand output to Q*.
	•	Subsidies: Per-unit subsidies to align MR with MC at higher Q.
	•	Public ownership/regulation: May simulate marginal cost pricing.
	•	Analyze limitations of interventions:
	•	Firms may incur losses with P = MC if AC > P.
	•	Requires accurate cost and demand info.
	•	Risk of firms misrepresenting costs to manipulate regulated prices.
	•	Innovation disincentivized under strict price controls.

Off-Syllabus/Non-Required Methods:
	•	No requirement to model behavioral nudges or non-price interventions.
	•	Externalities are not analyzed beyond basic underprovision context.

Relevant Visuals:
	•	Modified monopoly diagram with price ceiling at MC.
	•	Show Q* production, zero-profit condition, negative profit if AC > P.
	•	Show DWL removed vs. losses incurred.
	•	Diagram of subsidy shifting MR up to intersect MC at Q*.

Unit 3: Natural Monopoly and Average Cost Structures

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Natural monopoly: industry where one firm can supply entire market at lower cost than multiple firms.
	•	High fixed costs, declining average cost over the relevant range of output.
	•	Splitting the market among multiple firms increases AC and may result in negative profits.
	•	Entry barriers arise endogenously from cost structure.
	•	Long-run equilibrium is one firm; competition unsustainable.

Methods Required:
	•	Use cost curves:
	•	Show fixed cost, declining AC.
	•	Compare AC under monopoly vs. duopoly (same FC, lower Q → higher AC per firm).
	•	Graphical model:
	•	Monopoly: MR = MC gives QM and PM; AC is below P.
	•	Duopoly: Lower Q per firm; AC above price → losses.
	•	Derive outcomes with linear demand and constant MC:
	•	Monopoly produces ½ Q*.
	•	Duopoly (Cournot): each firm produces ⅓ Q*, total = ⅔ Q*.
	•	Show in diagram:
	•	Monopoly profit region.
	•	Duopoly loss region.
	•	Consumer surplus comparison.
	•	AC curves for both scenarios.

Off-Syllabus/Non-Required Methods:
	•	No requirement to model more than 2 firms or continuous entry.
	•	No Stackelberg or Bertrand competition required unless taught elsewhere.

Relevant Visuals:
	•	Cost diagram with FC, MC, and AC under monopoly and duopoly.
	•	Show inefficiency of duopoly due to elevated AC and lower P.
	•	Cournot duopoly diagram (optional if taught): reaction functions, equilibrium quantities.

⸻

Unit 4: Price Discrimination as Efficiency Tool

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	First-degree price discrimination: charging each consumer their willingness to pay.
	•	Monopolist captures entire CS as PS.
	•	Quantity increases to socially optimal level.
	•	No DWL; but equity concerns arise.
	•	Implementation problems (requires full information about each buyer’s utility).
	•	Alternative forms (not detailed): second-degree, third-degree discrimination.

Methods Required:
	•	Diagram of price discrimination:
	•	Demand curve + MC.
	•	Area between D and MC up to Q* becomes PS.
	•	No CS.
	•	Show no DWL.
	•	Link to marginal benefit = marginal cost at all units consumed.

Off-Syllabus/Non-Required Methods:
	•	No second or third-degree discrimination required unless taught.
	•	No detailed modeling of consumer types or price menus.

Relevant Visuals:
	•	Price discrimination diagram showing full surplus extraction.
	•	Compare to standard monopoly: higher Q, no DWL, no CS.

⸻

Unit 5: Regulatory Mechanisms and Their Failures

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Government can impose:
	•	Price ceilings at P = MC or higher to preserve profit.
	•	Subsidies to encourage Q → Q*.
	•	Nationalization or direct provision in special cases.
	•	Failures include:
	•	Information asymmetry (firm knows cost, government does not).
	•	Adverse selection/moral hazard (in cost reporting, investment).
	•	Incentive issues: no profit → no efficiency improvements.
	•	Political economy: subsidies may appear as rent-seeking.
	•	Trade-offs: zero profit requirement suppresses innovation.

Methods Required:
	•	Graph marginal and average cost with regulated price.
	•	Show losses if P < AC, sustainability if P = AC.
	•	Discuss information and incentive issues in qualitative terms.

Off-Syllabus/Non-Required Methods:
	•	No full cost-benefit analysis required.
	•	No dynamic modeling of regulation or Ramsey pricing required.

Relevant Visuals:
	•	Regulated monopoly with P = MC and losses (AC > P).
	•	Alternative with P = AC and zero profit (partial DWL).
	•	Compare both to unregulated monopoly.

⸻

Unit 6: Non-Natural Monopolies and Government-Created Monopolies

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Legal monopolies created for:
	•	Administrative simplicity (e.g. medical registration).
	•	Incentivizing innovation (e.g. patents).
	•	Public interest or standardization.
	•	Risks:
	•	Corruption, rent-seeking, inefficiency.
	•	Historical examples (e.g. East India Company).
	•	Patents trade off short-run inefficiency for long-run R&D incentives.

Methods Required:
	•	Discuss qualitative trade-offs between static efficiency and dynamic innovation.
	•	Identify role of legal institutions in market structures.

Off-Syllabus/Non-Required Methods:
	•	No modeling of innovation or patent expiry cycles.
	•	No modeling of corruption/payments unless separately taught.

Relevant Visuals:
	•	None strictly required, but illustrative examples (timeline of patent, static vs. dynamic surplus) could aid understanding.

	•	How does a natural monopoly differ in cost structure from a regular monopoly?
	•	Why does price discrimination remove DWL?
	•	When might a monopoly be second-best?

Overall Visual Summary:
	•	Monopoly: D, MR, MC, AC, QM, PM, DWL.
	•	Perfect competition overlay: Q*, P*.
	•	Duopoly: higher AC, lower P, loss region.
	•	Natural monopoly: declining AC, fixed cost emphasis.
	•	Price ceiling/regulation: compare to AC and MC.
	•	Price discrimination: full surplus to firm, no DWL.
	•	Patents/legal monopoly: not graphed but contextual.


Unit 1: Introduction to General Equilibrium

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Difference between partial and general equilibrium.
	•	General equilibrium considers all markets simultaneously.
	•	Interdependence of markets (e.g., effect of rice market on pasta market and vice versa).
	•	Feedback effects not captured in partial equilibrium.
	•	General equilibrium as a model of simultaneous determination of all prices and allocations across multiple markets.

Expected Methods:

Unit 2: Walrasian Equilibrium and Assumptions

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Developed by Walras, early 1900s.
	•	Walrasian equilibrium definition: a price vector such that all markets clear (i.e., Qd = Qs for all goods).
	•	All agents are price takers.
	•	No transaction/search costs, no uncertainty, no externalities.
	•	Competitive firms and consumers maximize utility and profit respectively.

Expected Methods:

	•	Generalization: vector of prices with equal demand and supply per good (mathematical concept, not drawn).

⸻

Unit 3: Pareto Efficiency vs Equilibrium

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Pareto efficiency: no reallocation can make someone better off without making someone worse off.
	•	Efficiency does not imply equilibrium and vice versa.
	•	Walrasian equilibrium focuses on price vectors, not utility levels.
	•	Equilibrium allocation may or may not be efficient.
	•	Goal: show conditions where equilibrium implies efficiency.

Expected Methods:

	•	Two-good model: Goods A and B.
	•	Firms take capital/labour and produce A & B with a PPF.
	•	Consumers derive utility from A & B.
	•	Aggregate PPF: bowed out from origin (due to increasing opportunity costs).
	•	Iso-profit lines: slope determined by price ratios (e.g., banana/apple prices).
	•	Budget constraints for consumers derived from firm profits.

Expected Methods:
	•	Draw and label: PPF, iso-profit lines (same slope as relative prices), indifference curves, equilibrium point.
	•	Calculate slope of iso-profit lines using price ratios.
	•	Interpret budget constraint as income from firm profits.
	•	Analyze whether a given price ratio leads to excess demand/supply.
	•	Demonstrate how equilibrium price is found by finding slope where tangencies align.

Off-Syllabus/Non-required:

	•	Indifference curves (bowed in).
	•	Equilibrium point: tangency of iso-profit line and PPF, and also indifference curve and budget line.
	•	Diagrams must show shifts when prices change (non-equilibrium case), e.g., surplus bananas, shortage apples.

Unit 5: General Equilibrium without Production (Pure Exchange / Edgeworth Box)

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	No production; two consumers trading two goods (e.g., cookies and brownies).
	•	Each agent has an initial endowment.
	•	Indifference curves represent utility from consuming goods.
	•	Efficient allocation: all goods consumed, identical marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between both consumers.
	•	Edgeworth Box: combines both consumers’ allocations in one graph.
	•	Tangency of indifference curves = MRS_1 = MRS_2 → Pareto efficiency.
	•	Contract curve = set of all Pareto efficient allocations.
	•	Trades move from initial endowment to somewhere on contract curve.
	•	Equilibrium price ratio is such that supply = demand and MRSs are equal.

Expected Methods:
	•	Construct Edgeworth box: label axes, origins, initial endowment (I), and total goods.
	•	Draw indifference curves for both agents, showing relative positions.
	•	Identify tangency points (Pareto efficient allocations).
	•	Draw the contract curve (set of all tangencies).

Unit 6: Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	First Fundamental Theorem: Any Walrasian equilibrium leads to Pareto efficient allocation.

Unit 7: Efficiency vs Equity

Concepts and Ideas:
	•	Efficiency ≠ equity.
	•	Contract curve includes both equitable and inequitable allocations.
	•	Equilibrium could be at a corner where one person has everything.
	•	Economics does not define equity; it’s a normative philosophical concept.
	•	Equity may require redistribution not captured by the model.

	•	Imperfect information (adverse selection, principal-agent)
	•	Externalities (not yet covered)
	•	Public goods (not yet covered)
	•	Non-maximizing behavior (satisficing consumers)
	•	Violations of assumptions cause efficiency to fail.

Expected Methods:
	•	Identify which assumption is violated in a given case.
	•	Explain how violation leads to inefficiency.

	•	Behavioral assumptions undermine standard model predictions.

Expected Methods:
	•	Conceptual reasoning only; not formalized.
	•	Use examples to illustrate where maximizing fails to describe real behavior.

Off-Syllabus/Non-required:
	•	No requirement to model utility of satisficing agents.
	•	No expectation of familiarity with formal behavioral economics models.
