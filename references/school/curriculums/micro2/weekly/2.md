**Module 1: Preferences, Budget Constraints, and Consumer Optimisation**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Preferences: consumer likes/dislikes over bundles.

• Budget constraint: combinations of goods affordable within income.

• Preference assumptions: completeness, transitivity, monotonicity (more is better), convexity.

• Bundles: combinations of goods A and B.

• Two-good model: simplifies visualisation and computation.

• Rational consumer: aims to maximize utility subject to budget constraint.

• Consumer’s utility maximisation subject to a budget constraint.

• Tangency condition: the point at which the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line maximises utility.

• Standard assumptions: smooth, convex, inward-bending indifference curves; linear budget constraints.

• Extremes: perfect substitutes (linear indifference curves), perfect complements (L-shaped indifference curves).

• Generic assumption: both goods are divisible and exhibit diminishing marginal rate of substitution.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Graphically represent indifference curves and budget constraints.

• Identify affordable, unaffordable, and suboptimal (dominated) bundles.

• Determine feasible set (on or below budget constraint).

• Recognize dominated bundles: strictly less of both goods than another affordable bundle.

• Set up and interpret a budget constraint: $P_A A + P_B B = I$

• Identify and mark tangency point between budget constraint and indifference curve.

• Use indifference curve diagrams to locate optimal bundle (point X).

• Determine and compare bundles before and after income changes.

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions:**

• Preferences beyond two goods not discussed in depth.

• No required algebraic manipulation of utility functions at this point.

• Lagrangian multiplier method (not required).

• Edgeworth boxes or higher-dimensional preference maps.

• Specific numerical utility functions are not explicitly used in this unit.

  

**Relevant Visuals:**

• Budget constraint as straight line from I/PA (x-axis) to I/PB (y-axis).

• Indifference curve maps with increasing utility levels outward.

• Zones:

• Above budget constraint: unaffordable.

• Below budget constraint: affordable but dominated.

• On budget constraint: potential optima.

• Budget constraint and indifference curve diagram showing original and new tangency point (e.g., point X to Y).

• Multiple indifference curves to indicate increasing utility levels.

• Shift in budget constraint due to income change.

**Module 2: The Consumer’s Optimisation Problem (Standard Case)**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Consumer chooses quantities of two goods to maximize utility given budget constraint.

• Objective:

Maximize U(A,B)

Subject to PA·A + PB·B ≤ I

• Optimum usually lies _on_ the budget line (equality).

• Standard case assumes smooth, convex preferences (e.g., Cobb-Douglas).

• Optimal consumption occurs where highest reachable indifference curve is tangent to budget line.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Set up utility maximization problem.

• Graph indifference curves tangent to budget line.

• Derive and understand the optimality condition:

MRS = MU_A / MU_B = PA / PB

• Interpret tangency as graphical and mathematical condition.

• Use rise/run to compute slope of budget line (PB/PA).

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions:**

• No requirement to solve using Lagrangian multipliers.

• No demand for utility maximization in >2 goods.

• Do not equate utility function with price ratio (conceptual error).

  

**Relevant Visuals:**

• Budget line from (I/PA, 0) to (0, I/PB).

• Smooth indifference curves tangent to budget line.

• Points X, Y, Z showing suboptimal and optimal bundles.

• Arrow indicating increasing utility.

• Diagram labels: U1 < U2 < U3…, tangency at optimal (A*, B*).

**Module 3: Preference Structures**

  

**Perfect Complements Case:**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Goods must be consumed in fixed proportions (e.g., left and right shoes).

• Utility function:

U(A,B) = min{ αA, βB }

• Indifference curves are L-shaped, corners along lines like A = B, A = 2B, etc.

• Optimal bundle lies where kink touches the budget constraint.

• Optimality conditions:

• Spend all income: PA·A + PB·B = I

• Maintain fixed ratio: αA = βB

  

**Perfect Substitutes Case:**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Consumer is willing to substitute goods at a constant rate.

• Utility function:

U(A,B) = aA + bB (linear)

• Indifference curves are straight lines with slope -a/b.

• Optimal consumption is corner solution:

• All of good A if MU_A/PA > MU_B/PB

• All of good B if MU_B/PB > MU_A/PA

• If MU_A/PA = MU_B/PB → infinite optimal bundles on budget line.

  

**Non-Convex Preferences:**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Bowed-out indifference curves: preference against consuming mixtures.

• Convexity assumption violated → tangency no longer sufficient.

• Optimal consumption occurs at one of the budget line intercepts (all of one good).

• MRS = price ratio at interior point doesn’t imply optimality.

  

**Methods Expected (All Cases):**

• Graph appropriate indifference curve (L-shaped, linear, bowed out).

• Identify optimal bundle:

• Complements: where kink touches budget.

• Substitutes: compare MU/P.

• Non-convex: compare corner utilities.

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions:**

• MRS undefined or infinite at all non-kink points (complements).

• No tangency method (complements, substitutes).

• No derivative computation (non-convex).

  

**Relevant Visuals:**

• Complements: budget line and L-shaped curves, corner touching constraint.

• Substitutes: parallel indifference lines, optimal point at axis.

• Non-convex: bowed-out curves, interior suboptimal.

**Module 4: Income and Price Changes, Substitution & Income Effects**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Income changes:

• Normal goods: demand increases with income.

• Inferior goods: demand decreases with income.

• Both goods cannot be inferior.

• Price changes:

• Decompose into substitution (movement along IC) and income effects (new IC).

• Hicksian (compensated) vs. Marshallian (uncompensated) demand.

• Giffen goods:

• Strongly negative income effect outweighs substitution.

• Quantity consumed increases despite price rise.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Graphical derivation of income effects using parallel shifts in budget line.

• Construct hypothetical budget line (BC’) parallel to new constraint but tangent to original IC.

• Decompose effects: substitution (Z → Z’) and income (Z’ → Y).

• Track quantity change to identify normal/inferior/Giffen goods.

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions:**

• No income elasticity or Slutsky decomposition required.

• No calculus-based derivations or Engel curves.

  

**Relevant Visuals:**

• Budget lines shifting/pivoting.

• Points Z (initial), Z’ (after substitution), Y (final).

• IC1, IC2.

• Giffen diagram with Y right of Z despite inward pivot.

**Module 5: Demand Curves, Elasticity, and Welfare**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Deriving demand curves from two-good models.

• Elasticity: $E_d = \frac{dQ}{dP} \times \frac{P}{Q}$

• Use of logs: $\frac{d \ln Q}{d \ln P}$

• Taxation:

• Lump sum: parallel inward shift.

• Per-unit: pivot of budget line.

• Lump sum yields higher utility for same revenue.

• Compensating vs. equivalent variation:

• CV: income needed to restore original utility.

• EV: income reduction equivalent to utility loss.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Differentiate demand to compute elasticity.

• Graph comparison of tax policies.

• Derive CV and EV using ICs and budget lines.

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions:**

• No midpoint (arc) elasticity.

• No estimation techniques.

• No Ramsey or Laffer analysis.

  

**Relevant Visuals:**

• Demand curves.

• Budget lines under different tax schemes.

• CV/EV diagrams with ICs and budget lines.

**Module 6: Cross-Price and Income Elasticities**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Cross-price elasticity:

• Positive → substitutes

• Negative → complements

• Income elasticity:

• 1: luxury

• <1 but >0: necessity

• <0: inferior

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Compute elasticity using:

• Cross-price: $\frac{dQ_x}{dP_y} \times \frac{P_y}{Q_x}$

• Income: $\frac{dQ_x}{dI} \times \frac{I}{Q_x}$

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions:**

• No regression-based estimation.

• No empirical data analysis.

  

**Required Diagrams:**

• None explicitly; numerical examples used.
