**1. Monopoly Profit Maximisation**  
A monopoly chooses output where **marginal revenue (MR) = marginal cost (MC)**. The corresponding price is found on the demand curve. Profit is the rectangle between price and average cost (AC) at that output level.

**2. Total Surplus and Deadweight Loss in Monopoly**  
Shows how monopolies cause **deadweight loss** by underproducing. **Consumer surplus**, **producer surplus**, and **deadweight loss** are highlighted relative to the socially optimal output.

---

**3. Natural Monopoly Cost Structure**  
Illustrates a monopoly with high **fixed costs**, resulting in **declining average costs**. Competition is unsustainable because duplicating fixed costs leads to inefficiency.

---

**4. Splitting a Natural Monopoly into Two Firms**  
Depicts the effect of splitting a natural monopoly. Each firm faces higher **average costs** and lower **market prices**, resulting in **negative profit** and unstable long-run equilibrium.

---

**5. Viable Competition with Lower Fixed Costs**  
With **lower fixed costs**, the **average cost curve** shifts down. This allows two or more firms to operate profitably, making competition feasible and efficient.

---

**6. Price Ceiling at Marginal Cost (Ideal Efficiency)**  
A **price ceiling** set at marginal cost leads to **socially optimal output**. All surplus goes to consumers, but firms earn **zero or negative profit**, making it unsustainable without compensation.

---

**7. Price Ceiling with Partial Deadweight Loss**  
A **higher price ceiling** is used to allow firms to earn **non-negative profit**. This introduces some **deadweight loss**, but enables long-run operation.

---

**8. First-Degree Price Discrimination**  
The monopolist charges each consumer their **willingness to pay**, capturing the entire **surplus** as profit. **Output is socially optimal**, but **consumers receive no surplus**.

**General Equilibrium and Edgeworth Box Visuals Explanation**


---

**1. Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) and Feasible Set**
Illustrates the bowed-out PPF, showing infeasible (outside), inefficient (inside), and potentially efficient (on the frontier) allocations.

---

**2. Indifference Curve Tangent to PPF (Pareto Efficiency)**
Depicts an indifference curve just tangent to the PPF, identifying the Pareto efficient point where utility is maximized given technical feasibility.

---

**3. Non-Equilibrium: Iso-Profit Line and Price Ratio (1:2)**
Shows firms maximizing profit at a point not matched by consumer demand, demonstrating disequilibrium with mismatched supply and demand.

---

**4. General Equilibrium: Price Ratio Leads to Tangency in Supply and Demand**
Displays a situation where the slope of the iso-profit line equals the slope of the indifference curve and the PPF—an equilibrium with all markets clearing.

**5. Edgeworth Box Construction: Initial Endowments**
The setup of the Edgeworth box with two consumers, each with an initial allocation of two goods, and individual indifference maps.

---

**6. Contract Curve: Set of All Pareto Efficient Allocations**
A red line drawn through all points where the indifference curves of the two consumers are tangent—representing Pareto efficient trades.

---

**7. Region of Pareto Improvements from Initial Allocation**
Shaded region shows where both consumers can become better off compared to the initial endowment—demonstrating potential mutually beneficial trades.

---

**8. Budget Line Through a Non-Optimal Price Ratio**
Illustrates the price line that results in an allocation (J) that improves upon the initial endowment (I) but does not reach efficiency.

![Budget Line Before Efficiency](image10-16.png)

---

**9. Budget Line Yielding Efficient Allocation (Z)**
The one price line that directly results in a final allocation on the contract curve—where marginal rates of substitution are equal and all goods are consumed.

---

**10. Exam-Style Edgeworth Box with Contract Curve**
A clean, exam-ready version of the Edgeworth box showing indifference curves for both consumers, initial endowment, and the contract curve.
