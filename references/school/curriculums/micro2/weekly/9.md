**Module 1: Consumer Theory**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Consumers aim to maximise utility.

• Utility derived from consumption.

• Consumers face budget constraints due to fixed income.

• Diminishing marginal utility of income: risk aversion.

• Utility function properties: concavity, diminishing returns.

• Indifference curves, budget lines.

• Income and substitution effects implied but not directly discussed.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Utility maximisation subject to budget constraint.

• Graphical analysis of indifference curves and budget lines.

• Comparative statics under changes in income or prices.

• Use of Lagrangian (implicitly assumed knowledge).

• Use of marginal rate of substitution equating price ratio.

  

**Off-syllabus Topics/Exceptions:**

• No intertemporal consumption models.

• No lifetime income/consumption models.

• No debt/credit constraint modelling beyond conceptual.

• No taxation, subsidies, or government intervention.

  

**Relevant Visuals:**

**Module 2: Producer Theory and Cost Structures**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Firms maximise profit, not utility.

• Profit = Revenue – Cost.

• Revenue intrinsically valuable; no credit constraint.

• Cost structure: increasing marginal cost from diminishing returns.

• Firms are risk-neutral: constant marginal utility of money.

• Output decision rule: produce where MR = MC.

• Total Cost (TC) function derived from production function.

• Marginal Cost (MC) = dTC/dQ.

• Convexity of cost curves assumed.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Solve profit maximisation using MR = MC.

• Set up and solve: max π(Q) = R(Q) – C(Q).

• Derive FOC: dπ/dQ = MR – MC = 0.

• Use derivatives to find MC, MR.

• Graph Revenue and Cost; locate max profit via largest vertical gap.

• Use product rule when differentiating R(Q) = P(Q)·Q.

• Plot cost function and derive MC from TC.

  

**Off-syllabus Topics/Exceptions:**

• No principal-agent problems.

• No organisational economics.

• No multi-period models or long-term investment modelling.

• No input cost breakdown or minimisation covered here.

  

**Relevant Visuals:**

**Module 3: Revenue, Elasticity, and Marginal Analysis**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Revenue = P(Q)·Q.

• Competitive firms: MR = P.

• Imperfect competition: MR < P.

• MR and elasticity: MR = P(1 + 1/ε).

• MR can be negative if demand is inelastic.

• Elasticity affects MR and profit-maximising output.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Differentiate R(Q) using product rule.

• Derive MR from inverse demand.

• Use MR = MC for optimal Q.

**Module 4: Market Structures and Firm Behaviour**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Monopoly: firm demand = market demand.

• Perfect competition: firm faces horizontal demand.

• Monopolistic/duopoly: residual demand.

• MR derived from firm-level demand.

• Linear demand: P = A – BQ → MR = A – 2BQ.

• Non-linear demand: MR derived case-by-case.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Use inverse demand to derive MR.

• Derive MR analytically.

• Compare MR under various structures.

• Apply MR = MC.

**Module 5: Profit Maximisation and Firm Output**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Profit = Q(P − AC).

• Optimal output: MR = MC (or P = MC).

• Positive profit: P > AC; Zero: P = AC; Negative: P < AC.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Compute vertical gap between P and AC.

• Identify output where profit area maximised.

• Use marginal reasoning for optimal output.

  

**Off-syllabus Topics/Exceptions:**

• No algebraic optimisation unless specified.

  

**Relevant Visuals:**

• Graphs with MC, AC, and P.

• Shaded profit/loss regions.

**Module 6: Supply and Market Equilibrium**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Perfect competition: firms are price takers.

• Firm-level supply: MC = P, only above AVC.

• Shut-down rule: P < AVC → no production.

• Market supply = N × firm supply.

• SR equilibrium: QD = QS.

• LR equilibrium: P = MC = min(AC), zero profit.

• Entry/exit drives LR equilibrium.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Derive Q from MC = P.

• Apply shutdown rule.

• Aggregate supply over N firms.

• Solve for equilibrium by setting supply = demand.

**Module 7: Taxation, Welfare, and Externalities**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Positive: price rise > tax.

• Surplus decomposition: CS, PS, Gov revenue, DWL.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Use wedge diagram to find PB, PS.

• Money: instrumental for consumers, goal for firms.

  

**Methods Expected:**

**Module 10: Comparative Statics and External Effects**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Demand shock raises price in SR → profit → entry → LR P returns to min(AC).
