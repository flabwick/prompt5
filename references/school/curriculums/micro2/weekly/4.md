**Unit 1: Two-Period Intertemporal Choice Framework**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Comparison between consumption now vs. consumption in the future

• Consumption smoothing across two periods

• Introduction to intertemporal choice as a framework

• Time as a structuring variable in utility

• Discounting future utility with parameter δ (delta)

• Intertemporal utility maximization

• Budget constraint linking consumption across periods with interest rate r

• Optimality condition: marginal rate of substitution equals relative price

• Substitution and income effects from changes in r

• Normal vs. inferior goods in intertemporal context

• Utility functions: log utility as special case

• Assumption of identical utility functions across periods

• Implications of marginal utility equality condition: MU₁ = (1 + r)δMU₂

  

**Expected Methods:**

• Treat time as two discrete periods (period 1 and period 2)

• Model consumption bundles as (C1, C2)

• Treat money as the single good consumed over time

• Use additive, time-separable utility: U(C1, C2) = u(C1) + δ * u(C2)

• Utility function: increasing, concave (e.g., log utility)

• Solve utility maximization using substitution or Lagrangian

• Derive and apply optimality condition: u′(C1) = δ(1 + r)u′(C2)

• Solve system of equations: optimality + budget constraint

• Use comparative statics for changes in r or δ

• Justify consumption direction change through normal goods assumption

• Calculate marginal utilities, marginal rate of substitution (MRS = u′(C1)/[δ * u′(C2)])

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions / Off-syllabus:**

• No continuous-time models

• No multi-good intertemporal bundles

• No stochastic time paths

• No use of corner solutions

• No use of Cobb-Douglas or CES unless specified as log utility

  

**Relevant Diagrams:**

• Basic 2D graph: C1 on x-axis, C2 on y-axis

• Indifference curves (bowed inward)

• Straight budget constraint with slope -(1 + r)

• Tangency point of indifference curve and budget line

• Arrows showing substitution/income effects from interest rate changes

• Optimality condition as tangency: MRS = (1 + r)/δ

**Unit 2: Log Utility Case**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Special case: u(C) = log(C)

• Marginal utility: u′(C) = 1/C

• Optimality condition becomes: 1/C1 = δ(1 + r)(1/C2)

• Derive C2 = δ(1 + r)C1

• Use budget constraint: C1 + C2/(1 + r) = I

• Solve for C1 and C2 exactly

• Example: δ = 0.95, r = 0.10, I = 100 → C1 ≈ 51.2, C2 ≈ 53.6

  

**Expected Methods:**

• Algebraic substitution and simplification

• Plug in values for numerical solution

• Interpret solution in terms of intertemporal smoothing

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions / Off-syllabus:**

• Other functional forms (e.g., CRRA, CES)

• Indirect utility functions

  

**Relevant Diagrams:**

• Graph of log(C): increasing and concave

• Budget line intersecting indifference curve with precise solution point

**Unit 3: Comparative Statics and Time Preference**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Analyze changes in r (interest rate):

• Substitution effect: r↑ → future consumption cheaper → C2↑, C1↓

• Income effect: direction depends on whether saver or borrower

• Net effect on C1 is ambiguous

• Analyze changes in δ (discount factor):

• δ↑ → stronger future preference → C2↑, C1↓

• MRS becomes flatter

• Substitution and income effects point to higher C2

  

**Expected Methods:**

• Decompose total change into substitution and income effects

• Use graphical and derivative reasoning

• Apply optimality condition to new r or δ

• Explain bundle movement through indifference and budget shifts

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions / Off-syllabus:**

• No full Slutsky/Hicks decomposition algebraically

• No requirement to derive indifference slope via calculus unless specified

  

**Relevant Diagrams:**

• Indifference curve shifts from δ changes

• Bundle movements and comparative static results

• Summary tables for substitution/income effects

**Unit 4: Multi-Period Models and Extensions**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• N-period model: utility = ∑ δˣ u(Cˣ)

• Equalize effective marginal utility: δˣ(1 + r)ˣ u′(Cˣ) = constant for all t

• Use Euler equations for intertemporal smoothing

• Graphical representation not applicable for N > 2

  

**Expected Methods:**

• Recursive reasoning or Euler equation derivation

• Simplify under equal interest and discount rates

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions / Off-syllabus:**

• No dynamic programming or Bellman equations

• No graphing for N > 2

  

**Relevant Diagrams:**

• Conceptual alignment of declining marginal utilities

**Unit 5: Non-Standard Preferences and Present Bias**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Non-separable utility: today’s consumption affects future utility

• Time-varying hedonic utility

• Quasi-hyperbolic discounting: present bias

• Utility: U = u(C0) + β ∑ δˣ u(Cˣ), where β < 1

• Preference reversals and dynamic inconsistency

  

**Expected Methods:**

• Interpret β as capturing present bias

• Compare exponential vs. quasi-hyperbolic discounting

• Solve for plans using backward induction (sophisticated agents)

• Construct utility tables for naive vs. sophisticated
