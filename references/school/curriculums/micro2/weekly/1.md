**UNIT 1: Preferences and Indifference Curves**

  

**Core Concepts:**

- Preferences as complete, transitive orderings over bundles of goods (e.g., apples and bananas).
    
- Indifference curves represent combinations of goods giving equal satisfaction.
    
- Direction of higher utility: typically up and to the right.
    
- Convexity indicates preference for diversity; convex (bowed-in) curves.
    
- Special cases:
    
    - **Perfect substitutes:** straight lines; constant MRS.
        
    - **Perfect complements:** L-shaped curves; consumed in fixed ratios.
        
    - **Bads:** upward-sloping curves; more of a bad lowers utility.
        
    - **Useless goods:** utility unaffected; flat or vertical curves.
        
    - **Concave curves (bowed-out):** reflect preference against diversity.
        
    

  

**Methods Required:**

- Sketching indifference curves from verbal descriptions.
    
- Labeling bundles and drawing arrows for increasing utility.
    
- Translating preference statements into qualitative indifference maps.
    
- Distinguishing between types of preferences based on shape.
    
- Explaining assumptions made when interpreting verbal preference statements.
    

  

**Non-Required:**

- No cardinal utility.
    
- No intransitive or discontinuous preferences.
    
- No 3D utility representations.
    

  

**UNIT 2: Utility Functions and Ordinal Utility**

  

**Core Concepts:**

- Utility functions assign numbers to bundles based on preferences.
    
- Only the ordering matters (ordinal utility); utility numbers not meaningful on their own.
    
- Different utility functions can represent same preferences (monotonic transformations).
    
- Examples:
    
    - **Perfect substitutes:** U = αA + βB.
        
    - **Perfect complements:** U = min(αA, βB).
        
    - **Cobb-Douglas:** U = A^α * B^β.
        
    

  

**Methods Required:**

- Sketching curves from utility functions.
    
- Evaluating utility for bundles.
    
- Converting equivalent utility functions (e.g., √bd and log(bd)).
    
- Identifying type of preferences from functional form.
    

  

**Non-Required:**

- No interpersonal utility comparison.
    
- No cardinal analysis unless stated.
    
- No welfare conclusions based on utility numbers.
    

  

**UNIT 3: Marginal Utility and MRS**

  

**Core Concepts:**

- Marginal utility: MU_A = ∂U/∂A; MU_B = ∂U/∂B.
    
- MRS (Marginal Rate of Substitution) = MU_A / MU_B.
    
- MRS reflects willingness to trade goods to stay on same indifference curve.
    
- MRS varies with consumption bundle unless utility is linear.
    

  

**Methods Required:**

- Computing MU using partial derivatives.
    
- Evaluating utility and MRS at specific bundles.
    
- Comparing trade-offs (e.g., compensation questions).
    
- Understanding MRS interpretation: slope of indifference curve.
    

  

**Non-Required:**

- No second derivatives or optimization.
    
- No use of implicit functions.
    

  

**UNIT 4: Budget Constraints**

  

**Core Concepts:**

- Budget constraint: P_A * A + P_B * B = I.
    
- Represents the set of affordable bundles.
    
- Slope: -P_A/P_B; reflects relative price.
    
- Shifts:
    
    - **Income change:** parallel shift.
        
    - **Price change:** pivot around axis intercept.
        
    

  

**Methods Required:**

- Graphing budget constraints with labeled intercepts and slopes.
    
- Identifying feasible and infeasible bundles.
    
- Analyzing effects of income/price changes.
    

  

**Non-Required:**

- No Engel curves, indirect utility, or multiple constraints.
    

  

**UNIT 5: Special Indifference Curve Forms**

  

**Perfect Substitutes:**

- Linear curves, constant MRS.
    
- U = ax + by.
    
- Preferences indifferent along lines with fixed slopes.
    

  

**Perfect Complements:**

- L-shaped curves; utility at corners.
    
- U = min(ax, by).
    
- No substitution away from fixed ratio.
    

  

**Bads:**

- Upward-sloping curves.
    
- Direction of higher utility toward less of the bad.
    

  

**Useless Goods:**

- Flat or vertical curves depending on axis.
    

  

**Methods Required:**

- Drawing and identifying linear, kinked, and non-standard curves.
    
- Interpreting the shape and direction.
    
- Applying to real-world examples (e.g., substitutes, bads).
    

  

**Non-Required:**

- No smooth trade-off at kinks.
    
- No utility derivation from first principles.
    

  

**UNIT 6: Technical Tools and Calculus**

  

**Core Concepts:**

- Microeconomic models use abstraction and mathematics.
    
- Variables: prices/income = exogenous; choices/utility = endogenous.
    
- Differentiation:
    
    - Power, product, chain rules.
        
    - Partial derivatives: ∂U/∂A, ∂U/∂B.
        
    
- Tangents represent slopes (e.g., MRS).
    

  

**Methods Required:**

- Differentiating basic utility functions.
    
- Solving simple systems (e.g., equating MRS and price ratio).
    
- Identifying variable roles in equations.
    

  

**Non-Required:**

- No Lagrangians or constrained optimization.
    
- No integration, matrix algebra, or higher-order calculus.
