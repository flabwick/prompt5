**Updated Progress Report: Student Understanding**

---

**Section 0: Uncovered Content**
*Content not yet examined or recalled in any session.*

* Moral hazard and adverse selection
* Natural monopolies and duopoly inefficiency
* Multi-period intertemporal models (Euler, CRRA)
* General equilibrium with production (PPF, iso-profit tangency)
* Welfare comparisons: compensating vs equivalent variation
* Production cost structures: expansion paths, MRTS
* Regulation failures and legal monopolies
* Voting systems and Arrow/Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorems

---

**Section 1: Needs Reinforcement**
*Topics previously attempted but currently show confusion or incomplete reasoning.*

* **Income and substitution effects:**
  Previously weak, and still not attempted in recent session. Remains in Section 1.

* **Perfect substitutes – utility and MRS interpretation:**
  Not revisited this session. Inconsistency between utility form and slope remains unresolved.

---

**Section 2: Initial Understanding**
*Demonstrated basic grasp, with mild inconsistencies or simplifications.*

* **Indifference map interpretation:**
  Not re-tested. Remains in Section 2.
* **Expected utility framework (setup only):**
  Not re-tested. Remains in Section 2.
* **Elasticity derivation via derivative method:**
  Now attempted. Student required tutor walkthrough but followed logic. Some conceptual alignment emerged. Moved here from Section 0.
* **Elasticity magnitude/sign interpretation:**
  Understood with guidance, including signs, absolute value convention, and context reasoning. New placement.

---

**Section 3: Stable Understanding**
*Topic explained with clarity, no errors during retrieval or application, but not yet tested under variation or delay.*

* **Revenue implications of elasticity (behavioral logic):**
  Correctly articulated reasoning for elastic/inelastic revenue effects. Demonstrated strategic thinking.
* **Classification of elasticity values and related outcomes:**
  Correct interpretation of –0.5, –1.5 examples; recognized revenue and quantity directionality.

---

**Section 4: Nearly Mastered**
*Topic successfully recalled and reasoned through across contexts or spaced sessions.*

*None currently at this level.*

---

**Section 5: Mastery Achieved**
*No errors or gaps across four spaced retrievals.*

*None currently at this level.*
