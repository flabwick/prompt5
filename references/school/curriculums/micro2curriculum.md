**UNIT 1: Preferences and Indifference Curves**

  

**Core Concepts:**

- Preferences as complete, transitive orderings over bundles of goods (e.g., apples and bananas).
    
- Indifference curves represent combinations of goods giving equal satisfaction.
    
- Direction of higher utility: typically up and to the right.
    
- Convexity indicates preference for diversity; convex (bowed-in) curves.
    
- Special cases:
    
    - **Perfect substitutes:** straight lines; constant MRS.
        
    - **Perfect complements:** L-shaped curves; consumed in fixed ratios.
        
    - **Bads:** upward-sloping curves; more of a bad lowers utility.
        
    - **Useless goods:** utility unaffected; flat or vertical curves.
        
    - **Concave curves (bowed-out):** reflect preference against diversity.
        
    

  

**Methods Required:**

**UNIT 2: Utility Functions and Ordinal Utility**

  

**Core Concepts:**

- Different utility functions can represent same preferences (monotonic transformations).
    
- Examples:
    
    - **Perfect substitutes:** U = αA + βB.
        
    - **Perfect complements:** U = min(αA, βB).

- No use of implicit functions.
    

  

**UNIT 4: Budget Constraints**

  

**Core Concepts:**

- Budget constraint: P_A * A + P_B * B = I.
    
- Represents the set of affordable bundles.
    
- Slope: -P_A/P_B; reflects relative price.
    
- Shifts:
    
    - **Income change:** parallel shift.
        
    - **Price change:** pivot around axis intercept.

**Module 1: Preferences, Budget Constraints, and Consumer Optimisation**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Preferences: consumer likes/dislikes over bundles.

• Budget constraint: combinations of goods affordable within income.

• Preference assumptions: completeness, transitivity, monotonicity (more is better), convexity.

• Bundles: combinations of goods A and B.

• Two-good model: simplifies visualisation and computation.

• Rational consumer: aims to maximize utility subject to budget constraint.

• Consumer’s utility maximisation subject to a budget constraint.

• Tangency condition: the point at which the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line maximises utility.

• Standard assumptions: smooth, convex, inward-bending indifference curves; linear budget constraints.

• Extremes: perfect substitutes (linear indifference curves), perfect complements (L-shaped indifference curves).

• Generic assumption: both goods are divisible and exhibit diminishing marginal rate of substitution.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Graphically represent indifference curves and budget constraints.

• Identify affordable, unaffordable, and suboptimal (dominated) bundles.

• Determine feasible set (on or below budget constraint).

• Recognize dominated bundles: strictly less of both goods than another affordable bundle.

• Set up and interpret a budget constraint: $P_A A + P_B B = I$

• Identify and mark tangency point between budget constraint and indifference curve.

• Use indifference curve diagrams to locate optimal bundle (point X).

• Determine and compare bundles before and after income changes.

  

**Non-Required Methods / Exceptions:**

• Preferences beyond two goods not discussed in depth.

• No required algebraic manipulation of utility functions at this point.

• Lagrangian multiplier method (not required).

• Edgeworth boxes or higher-dimensional preference maps.

• Specific numerical utility functions are not explicitly used in this unit.

**Module 2: The Consumer’s Optimisation Problem (Standard Case)**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Consumer chooses quantities of two goods to maximize utility given budget constraint.

• Objective:

Maximize U(A,B)

Subject to PA·A + PB·B ≤ I

• Optimum usually lies _on_ the budget line (equality).

• Standard case assumes smooth, convex preferences (e.g., Cobb-Douglas).

• Optimal consumption occurs where highest reachable indifference curve is tangent to budget line.

  

**Methods Expected:**

• Set up utility maximization problem.

• Graph indifference curves tangent to budget line.

• Derive and understand the optimality condition:

MRS = MU_A / MU_B = PA / PB

• Interpret tangency as graphical and mathematical condition.

---

**Module 3: Preference Structures**

  

**Perfect Complements Case:**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Goods must be consumed in fixed proportions (e.g., left and right shoes).

• Utility function:

U(A,B) = min{ αA, βB }

• Indifference curves are L-shaped, corners along lines like A = B, A = 2B, etc.

• Optimal bundle lies where kink touches the budget constraint.

• Optimality conditions:

• Spend all income: PA·A + PB·B = I

• Maintain fixed ratio: αA = βB

  

**Perfect Substitutes Case:**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Consumer is willing to substitute goods at a constant rate.

• Utility function:

U(A,B) = aA + bB (linear)

• Indifference curves are straight lines with slope -a/b.

• Optimal consumption is corner solution:

• All of good A if MU_A/PA > MU_B/PB

• All of good B if MU_B/PB > MU_A/PA

• If MU_A/PA = MU_B/PB → infinite optimal bundles on budget line.

  

**Non-Convex Preferences:**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Bowed-out indifference curves: preference against consuming mixtures.

• Convexity assumption violated → tangency no longer sufficient.

• Optimal consumption occurs at one of the budget line intercepts (all of one good).

• MRS = price ratio at interior point doesn’t imply optimality.

  

**Methods Expected (All Cases):**

    - Risk-averse
        
    - Value goods via money

---

**4. Profit Maximisation**

  

**Conceptual**

- Profit = Revenue – Cost
    
- Optimum at: MR = MC
    
- Graphical Representations:
    
    - Total Revenue vs Total Cost (profit = vertical gap)
        
    - MR vs MC (intersection = optimal quantity Q*)
        
    

  

**Equational**

- π(Q) = R(Q) – C(Q)
    
- dπ/dQ = MR – MC = 0 → MR = MC
    
- MR = d(P(Q)·Q)/dQ via product rule
    

  

**Revenue and Marginal Revenue**

- Revenue = P(Q) × Q
    
- MR = d(P(Q)×Q)/dQ = dP/dQ × Q + P
    
- Competitive Firms: dP/dQ = 0 → MR = P
    
- Monopolies: dP/dQ < 0 → MR < P
    

  

**Elasticity Connection**

- MR = P × (1 + 1/ε)
    
    - ε = –∞ → MR = P (perfect competition)
        
    - ε < –1 → MR > 0
        
    - ε > –1 → MR < 0 (should reduce output)
        
    

  

**Demand and MR Examples**

- **Generic Demand**:
    
    - E.g., P = Q^–2/3 → MR = (1/3)·Q^–2/3
        
    
- **Linear Demand**:
    
    - P = A – BQ → R = AQ – BQ² → MR = A – 2BQ

**5. Voting Systems and Social Choice Theory**

  

**Context**

- Special focus in place of auction theory due to federal election
    
- Objective: Evaluate voting rules using mechanism design and social welfare theory
    

  

**Core Concepts**

- **Mechanism Design**: Create systems to achieve desirable social outcomes
    
- **Social Welfare Function (SWF)**: Aggregates individual preferences
    
- **Desirable SWF Properties**:
    
    - _Pareto Efficiency_
        
    - _Pairwise Independence_ (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives)
        
    - _Condorcet Winner_ concept
        
    

  

**Voting Systems**

1. **Dictatorship**
    
    - Follows one voter’s preferences
        
    - Satisfies Pareto and pairwise independence
        
    - Unfair by design
        
    
2. **Borda Count**
    
    - Ranks via points based on position
        
    - More balanced than dictatorship
        
    - Violates pairwise independence; vulnerable to irrelevant alternatives
        
    
3. **First-Past-the-Post (FPTP)**
    
    - Only first preferences matter
        
    - Prone to strategic voting; ignores broader preferences
        
    - May elect Condorcet losers
        
    
4. **Single Transferable Vote (STV)**
    
    - Rank-based elimination until one gets majority
        
    - Reduces strategic voting; avoids Condorcet losers
        
    - Doesn’t always elect Condorcet winners
        
    
5. **Two-Round Voting**
    
    - Top 2 candidates from round one go to runoff
        
    - Better than FPTP, but still strategically manipulable
        
    
6. **Mixed Member Proportional (MMP)**
    
    - Combines district-based and proportional representation
        
    - Used in Germany, NZ
        
    - Balances representation and fairness; well-regarded
        
    

  

**Key Theorems**

- **Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem**
    
    - No SWF can satisfy Pareto, pairwise independence, and non-dictatorship with 3+ options
        
    
- **Gibbard–Satterthwaite Theorem**
    
    - Every non-dictatorial, deterministic voting system with 3+ options is manipulable
        
    

  

**Conclusion on Voting Systems**

- No perfect system
    
- Trade-offs between fairness, strategy-resistance, practicality
    
- Australia’s preferential system is robust but not flawless

**Merged Curriculum: Microeconomic Theory and General Equilibrium**

---

**Module 1: Perfect Competition, Monopoly, and Market Efficiency**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Perfect competition as a benchmark for efficiency

• Conditions: many buyers/sellers, homogeneous goods, perfect information, free entry/exit

• Marginal cost = marginal revenue as profit maximization condition

• In long-run equilibrium: zero economic profit, average costs minimized, total surplus maximized

• Producer surplus = profit in short run, but zero in long run

• Efficient allocation: P = MC

• Monopoly definition: single producer of a good/service

• Market power: price-setting ability

• Downward sloping demand curve → MR < P

• Monopoly leads to positive economic profit

• No entry → profits persist in long run

• Monopoly causes inefficiency: total surplus not maximized, deadweight loss from underproduction, average cost not minimized if Qm < Q*

• No productive or allocative efficiency

  

**Required Methods:**

• Compare marginal cost and marginal revenue

• Graph analysis of supply/demand, MC, ATC, MR

• Identify equilibrium price and output

• Draw monopoly diagram: demand, MR, MC, ATC

• Identify Q where MR = MC, find price from demand curve

• Calculate profit: (P – ATC) × Q

• Identify and shade deadweight loss area on graph

• Compare Qm vs Q*

• Compare ATC at Qm to minimum ATC

  

**Not Required / Off-Syllabus:**

• Behavioural assumptions or market dynamics under imperfect competition

• Collusion, cartel behaviour, dynamic pricing strategies

• Empirical estimation of DWL or surplus

  

**Visuals:**

• Graph with downward sloping demand and MR, U-shaped ATC, MC

• Mark Qm, Pm, ATC at Qm, and profit rectangle

• Monopoly diagram with CS, PS, DWL clearly marked

• Efficient output (Q*) compared to monopoly output (Qm)

  

**Equations:**

• Profit = TR – TC

• MC = MR at Q*

• P = MC in perfect competition

• Zero profit: P = ATC

• MR = d(TR)/dQ

• Profit = (P – ATC) × Q

• Total revenue = P × Q

• Deadweight loss = ½ × (Q* – Qm) × (P – MC)

---

**Module 2: Natural Monopoly, Regulation, and Government Intervention**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Natural monopoly: high fixed costs, ATC declines over relevant output

• Economies of scale: ATC falls as Q increases

• Single firm more efficient than multiple firms

• Splitting market raises ATC, may cause negative profits

• Price ceilings: P = MC restores efficiency

• Short-run: monopoly produces Q*

• Long-run: firm may exit if P < ATC

• Subsidies can correct underproduction: firm paid per unit to lower effective MC

• Government intervention: aims to improve efficiency under failure

• Market failure types: monopoly pricing, externalities, public goods, asymmetric info

• Limitations: info constraints, incentive issues, implementation costs

  

**Required Methods:**

• Cost diagrams to show rising ATC when output is split

• Use numerical assumptions to demonstrate 1 firm more efficient

• Draw monopoly with imposed price ceiling

• Identify profit/loss under ceiling

• Calculate necessary subsidy to induce Q*

• Profit = TR – TC, where TC includes duplicated FC

• Loss = (ATC – P) × Q

• Price ceiling = MC → efficiency

• Effective MC = MC – subsidy

• Government cost = subsidy × Q

• MB ≠ MC at market equilibrium under failure

• Social welfare loss = DWL

---

**Module 3: Price Discrimination and Strategic Output**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• First-degree price discrimination: charge each consumer MB

• Firm captures entire surplus, no DWL

• Q = Q*

• Equity concerns: zero CS

• Cournot competition: duopoly firms choose Q assuming other fixed

• Each firm produces 1/3 Q*

• Total market output = 2/3 Q*

• Inefficient but better than monopoly

  

**Required Methods:**

• Diagram of first-degree PD

• Show firm capturing all surplus

• Cournot: Q = ⅔ Q*

• 2 firms each: Q = ⅓ Q*

**Module 4: General Equilibrium Theory and Efficiency**

  

**Concepts and Ideas:**

• Partial equilibrium vs. general equilibrium (many interconnected markets)

• Price changes lead to flow-on effects between markets

• Necessity of modeling multiple goods

• Walrasian equilibrium: all markets clear

• Competitive markets, price taking, full info, no externalities

• Tangency between indifference curve and PPF = Pareto efficient allocation

• First Fundamental Theorem: Walrasian equilibrium → Pareto efficient

• Edgeworth Box (pure exchange): trade, MRS equalization, contract curve

• Second Fundamental Theorem: any Pareto efficient allocation supportable by suitable endowment and prices

• Equity vs. efficiency: not the same; equitable outcomes not ensured

  

**Methods Required:**

• Construct two-good general equilibrium models

• Trace substitution, feedback effects

• Define Walrasian equilibrium; check market-clearing with price vector

• Setting P < ATC may cause exit

• Market failure from broken assumptions:

• Imperfect competition (monopoly, monopsony)

• Imperfect info (adverse selection, principal-agent)

• Externalities and public goods

• Non-maximizing behaviour (satisficing)

• Robustness: welfare results hold broadly but fail with assumption breakdown

  

**Methods Required:**

• Identify failures from assumption breakdowns

• Understand theoretical failure modes

• Connect behavioral economics to inefficiency

• Identify regulation backfire scenarios

  

**Not Required / Off-Syllabus:**

• Mechanism design or formal modeling
