SPEAKER 1
There we go. Let's have a go at doing that straight away. Oh no, I gotta go for my finding God. I With that one. Oops, we need to do that. Where are we? Week 11, isn't it? Good. Done, jeez, I'm technological, aren't I, being able to do that? Extraordinary, isn't it? Good, OK. Get rid of that. OK, good. All right. Well, welcome everyone. Uh, I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners, uh, the number one now and pay my respects to elders, people and country. Just a reminder, we've had to do a slight shuffle of these final lectures of the course, mainly because one of our lecturers, uh, had, had a personal commitment where he had to reschedule. So I'm doing gender and the economy in modern Australia today. Professor Peter Whiteford is, is, uh, talking about tracing the welfare state tomorrow, so please do come along to that. Peter's basically one of the world's leading authorities on the welfare state, um, a major figure in the field, and always gives a great lecture, and, uh, John Hawkins will give the China boom lecture next week. So it'll be a bit out of sequence, he'll do the chute for China boom, we'll come to the lecture, uh, next week, but I don't think that'll make any great, uh, great difference. OK, so gender in the modern economy, or gender and the economy in modern Australia. What I do with this one, it's one of the kind of, uh, uh, you know, sort of, uh, synthetic, if you like, lecture, uh, lectures or, or, um, summarising lectures in the course. I go back over some of the weeks and topics that we've done previously and subject, I guess, a sharper lens of gender to those topics. So, you know, we've dealt with gender at various points during the course, we've dealt with, Um, uh, particularly women's, uh, experiences, entrepreneurs, as, as, as workers. We probably have less to say about masculinity, but we have talked about things like the male breadwinner idea, which was very much based on a particular notion of domestic masculinity. What I wanted to do today is, is to go back over some of that material and to, to rethink it in terms of, uh, a gender lens, but also to introduce some new material. Um, gender is a concept, I won't go into enormous detail here, it's a concept that I think has been widely deployed in the, the social sciences and humanities since about the 1970s, and it's really concerned with the ways in which differences between men and women. Uh, images and roles associated with masculinity and femininity are handled in cultural and social terms, OK, so it is in a way a kind of conceptual framework for apprehending reality, including understanding the past. Any number of conceptual frameworks that one can use to do that, but gender is one that we, we customarily use and, and, and find helpful in, uh, explaining some aspects of the dynamics in the past. And I hope what I have to say will illustrate that um through some examples um today. So, you know, it's one of the things I wanna do in this, in this lecture is to really invite you to rethink, I guess some of the silences that we, we encounter in a course such as this. What are the things that aren't spoken of, what are the things that are, Only half visible or invisible when we talk about the economy, when we use concepts like gross national or gross domestic product, for instance, when we talk about a living wage or a minimum wage, when we use some of those customary terms like economic growth and so on, you know, what, what uh, what are we not talking about, what is rendered, uh, either invisible or barely visible, In that kind of discourse, and here's one example of that, and I guess, um, you know, the fact that uh we finally do have uh a statue honouring Zelda Delpranno outside Trades Hall in Melbourne, only from uh a couple of years ago, I think it was unveiled, I don't have the exact, uh, uh, date in my head, I think about 2023, but a very recent, Uh, statue there on, on the left, and I think we're reminded of the ways in which aspects of our history generally, of Australian history generally, including economic history, um, are often invisible in the conventional narratives, you know, even a book which is good, I think, as, as Ian McLean's Why Australia Prospered. I wonder if he really does give due attention. To gender in a book like that, he certainly, it comes in as an explanatory tool at certain points. You might recall his very interesting argument that the much um expanded involvement of women in the workforce in the Second World War lays the basis, he believes, for greater women's economic. in paid work after the war and therefore for certain aspects of the post-war boom, so he links, you know, uh, women's labour in those two phases, the war and the post-war, in an explanation of, of, of the post-war boom. So it's not that McLean ignores gender, does he give it enough attention though? Let's, let's perhaps, uh, consider that today. So, um, Selda Delpranno, of course, chained herself to the Commonwealth Building in Melbourne. In 1969, uh she was a trade unionist, she was in fact active in the meatworkers union. Um, and you can see there, uh, her protest on the right of the screen, more, and no more male and female rates, one rate only. And this was a challenge, of course, to the male breadwinner system that we've spoken about at a number of points in this course, going all the way back to the harvester judgments of 1907, or the harvester decision of HB Higgins, president of the, uh, Common. Of court of conciliation and arbitration where he lays down 42 shillings as the rate, the the the sort of rate of a living wage, but he conceives it very much as a male breadwinner's wage. It's it's it's sufficient for a man to support a wife and three children. Of course it gives rise to a whole political economy, really, to a whole regime of social policy, uh, in which men's and women's entitlements are quite different. And in which economic protection for women is largely affected, at least in theory, in practise, of course, it was often very different, but in theory through paying a male breadwinner's wage, that is through a family wage, OK, and you can see here uh Zelda Delpranno uh protesting against the fact that that has given rise to differential, uh, what rates of paid between between men and women. Uh, the women, and here's her testimony, uh, of an, an arbitration, uh, commission, as it was called by this stage, hearing. The women sat there day after day as if mute, while the men presented evidence for and against their worth. It was humiliating to have to sit there and not say anything about our own worth. I found the need to sit there silent, almost beyond my control. I was incensed with the entire setup. So, also, not just challenging if you like the outcomes, the output, if you like, of this process of wage arbitration, which we've, Explored in this course, but also the institution itself, the ways in which the processes and institutions are dominated by male voices are dominated by men's agency in which women are pushed to the margins, OK, so the phenomenon for instance of. The trade union with its male leadership, uh, often significant numbers of women workers by the 1960s, but the hierarchy of the union was essentially a male dominated one. That was certainly the case with the meat workers to which Delpranno belonged. So let's um talk a little bit about, you know, this in a more abstract way, and, and feminism has been critical of many aspects of economics and economic history of the way in which it has been conceived, of the way in which it's been carried out. And some of the critiques are along these lines. Firstly, the neglect of reproduction, the fact that women are essential to the to the reproduction of the workforce. And therefore, to the economy as a whole, and there's a kind of invisibility, I think about reproduction within uh economic history. We've probably, you, I mean you think about this course, we've probably said more in this course about immigration and the role that immigration has played in building workforces than we've we've we've talked about uh reproduction within uh the the household. OK, the, the reproduction by men and women, but through women's labour. Uh, and women's, you know, women's role in the household of, uh, a workforce. And, and we've had, we just kind of assume that it's, uh, there, that it's, it's taken for granted aspect at times of our economic history, um, and, and that's really what feminists are drawing attention to here. The neglect of, of the home as a, a site of production, which I'll talk about a bit more at the moment. Again, think of how households are often represented within the kind of economic history we've been doing. Very often as sites of consumption, in which someone goes out into the paid workforce, sometimes women, but more commonly man, they bring wages into the household and that facilitates consumption. OK, that that's a very common way of thinking about households, and we still do it today, but there's perhaps more reason to do it today, it's still inaccurate, highly inaccurate as a way of thinking about how households work, but, In a lot of the periods that we've been talking about in this course, the household is an incredibly important place for quite conventional forms of economic production, and I'll talk about that briefly in a moment. Thirdly, and this of course is still highly relevant to households today, the neglect of unpaid labour, and we can link this up with a broader critique of both economic and labour history that's come from historians such as uh Melanie Oppenheimer. And that is that a lot of our conventional ways of thinking about work and about the economy and about production, neglect or ignore unpaid labour. Um, sometimes it's voluntary labour in the public sphere, but also the unpaid labour, which is, uh, disproportionately women's labour in the home itself, the work of childbearing, the work of maintaining, uh, a household, all of those kinds of things are still there. They fall disproportionately on, on women. And again they have a kind of invisibility, I think in many of the concepts and narratives associated with uh economic history. And fourthly, um, the use of the household as a unit of analysis neglects inequality within families. So if we focus on the household, there are quite a lot of surveys that do this, what's actually happening within that household in terms of what kinds of labour are being, uh, you know, is being performed by men, by women, by children, and another something else that, that, uh, we need to take into account here. How uh resources are distributed within households, even something as basic as who gets to eat what within households where there's scarcity. These kinds of things can often be invisible when our units of analysis are sort of pitched at a level where we we're we're unable to dig down. Now we do actually now have surveys, there have been surveys for some decades. There's a survey called HILDA, for instance, which is carried out regularly in Melbourne. Uh, which I won't go into the acronym mainly because I'll embarrass myself by not being able to remember all the bits and pieces of it, but the HILDA survey does do things like measure, um, the hours performed in household labour by men and women. So we do have surveys that that make this kind of thing much more visible now, but throughout much of the economic history of Australia, that kind of data doesn't exist. Or, as I'll explain in a moment, we have data. That looks kosher, that looks, you know, reliable, that looks objective, and all the rest of it, but actually is highly misleading about how men's and women's contributions to the workplace, to the, to, to, to uh production are actually happening. I'll get to that in a moment. Again, think of some of those concepts that are rolled off my tongue and the tongues of other, uh, lecturers and no doubt tutors in the course, gross domestic and gross national product per capita GDP, uh, think of the, you know, ideas of sectoral shares of GDP, you know, manufacturing, pastoralism, agriculture, uh, services, patterns of trade, who Australia's trading with, what Australia's trading. Where is gender in all this? OK, it's often invisible in these kinds of discussions, yet we know that, uh, you know, any arguments, for instance, to take one example about sectoral shares of GDP has strongly gender dimensions. I mean, think of the growing and important role of women in the services sector in modern Australia. OK, this is. Highly gendered phenomenon. OK. And yet we, we, we often pitch our discussions at levels of, you know, 60% of, of, of the economy, uh, uh, uh, or 60% of GDP with services. But we, we often don't dig down, uh, to, to actually analyse the gendered characteristics of, of, of those sectoral shares. So just going back to, you know, um, earlier parts in the course, we, I drew attention, I think probably was it week one, certainly a long time ago, maybe a week two, to, to women's entrepreneurship in early, uh, colonial Australia. I mean we have well-known examples from the convict era, uh, Mary Reby, Elizabeth McArthur, whose, um, you know, role as, as, as wives and mothers really fans out into a more independent entrepreneurial role. In the case of Mary Reby, she's widowed. And so, uh, you know, inherits property from her husband, and of course becomes an entrepreneur in her own right. In Elizabeth McArthur's case, you might remember that her, her, her husband, um, um, has to go off to, uh, to, to, to London after the uh the rum rebellion, he's gone for years, he's gone for years, and so, you know, we, we commemorate. Uh, we did commemorate, I should say, on the $2 note, you know, years ago we'd have a picture, I know that it's a long time since we've had $2 notes, but we had $2 notes, and, and there was John McArthur, pioneer of the wool industry. So had a picture, you might, you might remember I showed it to you, you had a picture of John McArthur with a lovely looking Merino sheep next to him on the $2 note. Where was Elizabeth? OK, where was Elizabeth? On what note did she appear? Well, of course she appeared on no note back then, um. Newspaper, and this is where, you know, the whole issue of sources, which those of you came along, To the uh Butlin archives uh some weeks ago, you know, I guess we're introduced to just how important, um, the, the primary source base of research is in economic history. And this is a really interesting example, a very good example of the ways that, uh, electronic, um, our digital, uh, newspaper databases have been used to bring. Colonial women's entrepreneurship into into view. Um, to take, you know, one example there of Cath Bishop's minding her own business. I mean, using online newspaper databases for both Australia and New Zealand, she was also able to show the mobility of, of individual women, because you can trace them through, um, uh, key word searching. In a way that was frankly impossible when, you know, we were using microfilm or hard copy of newspapers, you can actually see that a woman working in Sydney, uh undertaking some business in Sydney in say 1860, might turn up in Wellington. 15 years later doing something completely different, OK, and it's given a new perspective on the uh uh place of women's entrepreneurship in in economies, but also some of the some of the characteristics of that entrepreneurship that is often characterised by surprising levels of geographical mobility, that it's characterised by women undertaking a range of different kinds of business across the life course. OK, so if you're interested in this kind of thing, Cath Bishop's work's terrific, you've looked at an article by her earlier in the course, she's done much more detailed work on both Australia and New Zealand since, and similarly with Claire Wright, um, her very earliest work, some of you might know her work from more recent times, she's a very well-known author now. Um, but Claire, her, her PhD and early first book was Beyond the Ladies' Lounge, Australian, Australia's Female Publicans, where she homes in on the role of, of women as a particular kind of entrepreneur, as a, as a hotel keeper, a publican. um, and I remember this from, you know, my, my own mother's stories of growing up in northern Melbourne, you know, northern suburb in in a suburb of of Melbourne. Uh, in the 1930s and 1940s and the publican of the the hotel that was right next to where, you know, her parents had their shop and where she lived, Croxton Park Hotel, which is still there actually, uh, was, was a woman that my mother always referred to as Mar Kelly. OK, Mark Kelly, beautiful, is it, evokes Irishness, evokes, uh, sort of maternalism, you have the whole lot. And she'd talk about how, you know, the, the women were allowed into the bar, into the ladies' lounge to drink in the afternoon, but at a certain point in the afternoon, Mark Healy, uh, would come out with pails, you know, like pails that you take camping. And they'd be filled with with beer, and the women would be sent packing with their pails of beer to take home to their, their husbands for when their husbands arrived home. OK, you can see there the the gendered expectations about men and women. We were allowed in the pub to drink in a certain part of the pub, in the ladies' lounge at a certain time in the afternoon. Mark Kelly ensured that the women were sent home to fulfil their womanly duty. Of, of cooking their meals for their husbands and no doubt to, to give them some beer and a little pail, perhaps to have some themselves, uh, unless, of course, their husbands were perhaps, uh, uh, uh, visiting the same pub, but in a different bar, the public bar, before 6 o'clock when the pub would close and everyone would have to leave. So, um, women as, as publicans, you know, an important role in, in, in this sort of industry. OK, let me talk a bit more about the male breadwinner idea. Now we've come across this in the course. OK, people are familiar with the basic idea here. OK, born in Australia basically is a legal concept really in 1907 through the Harvester decision. But, but, it it hid a multitude of complexities. Let me talk a little bit about those, those here. One of these was discovered by historians back in the 1980s. 1 of our colleagues here actually, uh, or she came to ANU later, Desley Deacon, discovered this, and it's very, very interesting. She and other historians were puzzled. They were puzzled when they looked at the colonial census. So the, the, the you know, you all know the census, the national census we have in Australia every five years. Well, before 1911, that was undertaken at the level of the colony. There was a Victorian census, there was a New South Wales census, South Australia, and so on. Very similar to to to what would happen nationally from 1911. And they were puzzled because. The figures for Victoria and New South Wales on farming, when they were compared simply didn't add up. Simply didn't add up This seemed to be. A a very um large number of uh essentially farmers in the uh Victorian case. Individuals contributing. labour and entrepreneurship to the farm, being counted as essentially productive units when accounting for the, the, the, you know, agricultural industry. But there was only about half the number for New South Wales when they did the, the figures, you know, the same sorts of count the counting it looked like, looked like the same things were being counted, but many more many more dependents. There were many more individuals in the rural economy of New South Wales who were showing up in the figures as dependents. Now all this was, all this was. All this amounted to was, was a kind of different approach. To collecting statistics, a different approach to counting heads, but it was highly ideological. In Victoria, the census chief, the man who took the census was called Hater, Henry Hayter. And he had a kind of classical liberal understanding of economic production. If an individual was a productive unit, hater wasn't particularly interested if they were a man, a woman or a child, they'd be counted. And so when he was, he was essentially counting farmers, the women were basically just thrown in with the rest as productive units on a farm. OK. His equivalent in New South Wales was a man called Timothy Coughlan, TA Coghlan, very famous figure in Australian economic history because he later, after he went to London, wrote really the first big Australian economic history. Now Coghlan Took a different view, Coghlan's background, he was a Catholic. He had, he was also a kind of, I suppose you'd say, uh a progressive liberal, perhaps even a kind of almost a social democrat. You know, a strong believer in concepts like the male breadwinner and living wage idea. And he basically counted farmers. Only Um, or rather, he counted, uh, only men, only the male farmer, when assembling the statistics on farming in New South Wales, the farmers' wives, Were counted as dependents. He categorised them as dependents. Now ideologically what he's doing here, of course, is he's upholding the concept that a producer is a man, and there's something rather disreputable about the idea of women being out in the fields and doing farm labour. It looked a bit continental and European, uh a bit barbaric and uncivilised to a figure such as Coghlan. And that ideological disposition has shaped the ways in which he's taken the census, the ways in which the census calculations have been carried out. And so in two colonies, you know, just a river between them. The accounting of farm work and and farm entrepreneurship of of um if you like, you know, the, the farm production was quite different. And so you've got, you know, it's, it's a real reminder that those often objective looking columns of statistics do embody values. They embody ideas and ideologies. Now in 1890, the various census chiefs from around Australia got together because they saw this as a problem. They said, well, we need, we need a common set of standards, otherwise we can't really, you know, compare. Statistics between colonies, and we need to be able to do this, you know this is a period where federation's beginning to get off the ground, and so they do adopt a common standard. What do you think they might have adopted, it being 1890? Sorry? Yeah, they adopted the Coghlan one for New South Wales, and you can see how that feeds in to the ideologies that we and and practises and institutions we know we all know about the male breadwinner ideal. The idea that a productive worker is a man and a dependent is a woman, or perhaps a child. OK, so people clear on, on that, reasonably clear what's happening there. So if you want the whole argument, it's in a journal called SIS, S I G N S, uh, 1985, Desley Deacon, D E A C O N, you'll get it in full text through the ANU library website. Um, but there have been other studies too that have looked at aspects of, of, of census taking that reveal the way these ideologies work. So women's role in production. Which is kind of visible, or had been visible in the case of the Victorian census becomes invisible, uh, you know, as, as national census taking develops um based on the New South Wales precedent. Other aspects of women's production that are often invisible within economic statistics. Women produce goods in the home. They made and mended clothing. OK, who, who, who's you know, mother or, um, parents, grandparents make their own clothing here, yeah. Yeah, yeah, a little bit, little bit, it's probably less common than it used to be. My mother made all of her own dresses, all of them. Um, so it was a very common thing to do. And of course, um, mothers usually did it for, for children, for babies, very common. Making a mending of clothing, um, the growing of fruit and vegetables, OK, the backyard with fruit with, with its fruit trees, the quarter acre block in Australia, the suburban. Ideal, often allowed for that. Uh, people living in in rural areas of course were were generally quite easily able to grow things like fruit and vegetables on their own, their own land. The keeping of poultry of chooks, OK, again, very common, uh, for, for, well, deep into the the 20th century, who he lived in a house where they had chooks in the backyard. Yeah, it still, it still happens, it still happens, um. You probably do it more for fun, it's nice to have, but you could go out, and probably a dangerous thing to say these days, but you could probably go out and afford eggs, your families, but in, in these cases we're we're talking about an environment often of greater scarcity. OK. Um, the keeping of bees. Remember our next door neighbour in Melbourne kept bees, uh, making of food, bread, jam. People do this, uh, for a hobby these days, and they probably enjoy the fact that they're saving a bit of money, that they're perhaps eating fresher food than they get down the, the supermarket, all those sorts of things. But, um, you know, it's probably, uh, for most of us more marginal, I think, as an economic activity than it was in this period, where it's more integral to the solvency of any particular household. Um, women provided services in the home, of course, um, they managed household budgets, they prepared food, they had children, looked after them, as I've already talked about, they cleaned, and they entertained. Uh, it's also worth keeping in mind here the phenomenon of outwork, where women were involved in, um, certain types of manufacturing, um, it was often outwork where women took the materials into the home. And produced, uh, um, you know, could be dresses or it could be boots and shoes within the household itself and were paid by the piece, and the finished products would be taken back to uh the factory. OK, so that's a very very still very common, less common in Australia than in many other countries, but artwork is still a a global phenomenon, very common in late 19th early 20th century in Australia. The good wife was valued, yes, as as a partner, sexuality and marriage, but also as an economic asset. OK, keep in mind also the gender imbalance, OK, the imbalance of sex ratios through much of 19th century Australia, where there are many more men than women. It's not really until we get it to about the 1870s that you can see this beginning to really balance out, in some place like Melbourne, you are getting a relatively balanced sort of. Uh, um, ratio of men and women. But deep into the 20th century in rural Queensland, there are many more men than than women. So a woman was valued, not least, because marriageable women were often scarce in, in colonial Australia. OK, many convicts, many male convicts, and, and remember, I think male convicts what outnumbered the women was it 6 to 1, probably remember from week one. Um, it's very common for male convicts to die bachelors, OK, to die as bachelors because there simply weren't enough women for them to marry. Um, the sexual division of labour, uh, uh, is, is a very important aspect of, uh, uh, the, uh, economy, uh, in Australia. Uh, it remains, the legacies are still with us in various ways. There are still certain kinds of work, as you know, that are understood, conceptualised as women's work more than as men's work and vice versa. So it's not that the sexual division of labour isn't with us, but it has deep roots in, um, the, certainly in 18th and 19th century Australia. There were fairly clear demarcations between what was considered men's and women's work in colonial Australia. There's a lot of grey areas too, and I, I guess I just described one of them, farm labour being one of those, um. And sexual division of labour was in large part maintained through wage differentials. So in other words, a man's job usually attracted something like a male breadwinner's wage. So the, the, the, I mean, Higgins in, in 197 didn't stumble across 42 shillings by accident. OK. Um, the harvester judgment's a bit of a fraud, actually, you know, he brings in all these people giving him evidence, Oh, it cost me this much to run my household. All the evidence is there in the, in the transcript. But in fact, he basically just settles on what had been a laborer's wage, you know, in the 1870s and 1880s, 42 shillings a week. In other words, uh, uh, 7 shillings a day, basically, of 66 day week, 6 times 742. So he, he kind of, you know, he doesn't. And it's given a kind of, you know, gloss of research and science, but in fact he basically settles on what had been a laborer's wage. And of course that was a man's wage. That was considered a kind of a, a, a minimum wage that, uh, you had to pay a man if he was going to live respectably as a family man. Anything less than about 42 shillings back in the 1880s, it was just considered you wouldn't be able to do that. Now of course many jobs did attract less than 42 shillings uh for a 6 day week. So man's jobs tend to attract a male breadwinner's wage. A woman's job might attract half of a breadwinner's, so 20 shillings a week rather than 42 shillings a week, somewhere around there. Uh, to put that in perspective, a really good skilled worker, someone like a, a train driver, would get about 20 shillings a day. OK. So a train driver, a compositor in a printing office, highly skilled, uh, uh, work, um, involving an apprenticeship, would be getting probably about, uh, what, uh, in a day what a woman might get in a, in a week. OK, they're they're the kind of differences we're talking about here. Uh, so a woman's job might attract half of a of of a breadwinners for roughly comparable work, but difficult to compare, of course. The assumption of course was that married women didn't work and so you didn't need to pay them a breadwinner's wage. Single women, it was said, were working for pocket money. Or to supplement a family's income until they married, and then would be protected by a male breadwinner's wage. You can see there a picture of, of women coming out of a factory, um, and, and the slants, as you can see, is very much towards younger women. That is a group of, of younger women. OK? So the idea was that it was something you did between school and, and marriage to earn the term that was used in, in the 19th century was pin money, they called it pin money. But, you know, we'd say pocket money today. OK. Now of course the reality is that many women did actually have families dependent on them. OK, that's the reality. I'm talking here about, you know, how kind of a wage system is constructed around certain types of expectations and images. Changing contours of women and paid work and here you've got some of them. Keep in mind, I mean that's the image, you know, that sort of is quite. The idea of the factory girl is emerging as almost a kind of national type by the time we get to the later 19th century, and, and Tayloresses went out on strike in the early 1880s, so they're becoming unionised, they're adopting the, the same kinds of industrial strategies as as as male, uh, unions. Um, but the main form of paid labour for women was domestic service. Uh, it's domestic service, um, until the early years of the 20th century. I think the turning point's about 197, and that's when they go from being over 50% to under 50%. OK, domestic servants often living in a household. OK, and providing you know, a, a, a form of paid labour, um, which, uh, you know, would, would involve a whole range of, uh, uh, you know, sort of needs of a middle class, usually an upper middle in Australia, an upper middle class household, caring for children, cleaning. Uh, laundering, uh, those sorts, gardening, um, uh, there were some men, of course, um, some men were involved in domestic service, but it was particularly a field for, for, for women, and very hard work, because remember, we're talking about a period where labour saving household appliances barely existed. I mean they really take off around the 1920s, so, you know, for the 19th century up to about World War One. If you had to wash a bed, a double bed sheet, it's really hard, heavy work, really hard, heavy work, and it's done by hand, so you can see how labour intensive this would have been, it's poorly paid, it's often under the, the, the, you know, quite harsh taskmaster, who might be the, the mistress of the house who who's able to, to watch what you're doing, so many younger women thought that was a a preferable thing to do. More freedom Didn't have to live in. Basically, as soon as you're out the factory gates, your time was your own. And often for for slightly better wages too. And and lower hours, protected hours increasingly as the unions became involved. So, domestic service, um, as I've already indicated, manufacturing is becoming significant in the 19th century, into the early 20th century. There are some of the big ones, uh, clothing, so uh the tailoress was the, the, the term that was used. It was the tailoress's union, footwear, boots, shoes, uh, food processing and packaging. OK, so those, um, you know, kind of all those industries that are sort of linkages from rural industry, from. Cans of soup, jam making, factories, all the rest of it, um, women, women were involved in that biscuit making, those sorts of things. Um, as I said, some of this is done, particularly clothing and footwear is done as artwork. They do it at home, they make up stuff from the materials provided by the factory, and then they take the, the items back. They're paid by the piece rather than by the hour. There's also a growing presence of women in the commercial workforce in the 20th century as typists and secretaries, replacing male letter writers and clerks. OK, so clerical work, the 19th century equivalent if you like, of the typist is, is mainly male work. And they're in short supply. OK, one of the key roles was letter writer. OK, those of you who went to the Butlin archives, if you remember, those big volumes that had the, the, the carbon copies of the letters that had been written by the, the letter writers, that's mainly male work. And it begins, you get paid nothing, very little, very poor pay when you go out as a probably a 15 year old, uh, yeah, probably 15 years old to to begin that sort of work. But as you get more seniority, you, you would be paid more. And so there's, there's social mobility through clerical work in the 19th century. Look, it has some resemblances to IT work today, OK? Um, cause they're, they're often in short supply clerks in the, in the 19th century. Um, as, um, new technologies came in, there were quite a few of these, but the one that we remember most, I guess is the typewriter. Um, it, it is increasingly feminised, and women are paid less for doing work, the same kinds of work that men had done as clerks in the 19th century. OK. It's a complex process, but basically, it, it, it, it does involve the emergence of typists as secretaries, the emergence of typing pools in offices, in, in large enterprises, and the, the, if you like, wages are degraded in that context through the processes I've been talking about, this idea that women should not attract. Uh, a, a breadwinner's wage, OK. Um, women are also increasingly present as shop assistants in the emerging department stores, the modern department store is emerging at the end of the 19th early 20th century. I think Myer, Myer is established in Bendigo. People still know about Myer, I know hardly anyone goes to these places, but Myer, uh, was established in Bendigo in 1900, if I remember correctly. So, you know, the department store emerges, uh, particularly around this time, and women are, are in a growing presence among shop assistants. I've talked in the course at various points about some of the state interventions, state intervened in the economy as we know through tariffs to protect the industry, but also through industrial arbitration to set wages and conditions. In support, as I've already indicated of the male breadwinner concept. The there was this idea of new protection under the Deakin government in the early 20th century, and this was the idea that manufacturers would only get tariff protection if they paid fair and reasonable wages to their workers, and there was a kind of legislative regime. Set up to ensure this, much of which was invalidated by the High Court, it has to be said, but by then the arbitration court has already intervened to establish various principles around the living wage, and the harvester judgement comes out of that process in 197, as I've said, 42 shillings a week, basically 6 times 7, considered sufficient for a man to support a wife and three children. Um, the, and the family wage becomes central to social policy, can you see a problem with this in terms of fairness? What's the problem with this? Who here in this room is a single male, an unmarried male with no dependence on them, no children to look after? Most of you, right? Pretty good, hey? Pretty good, you get a family wage, you get a male breadwinner's wage, no wife, no kids, fantastic. Fantastic, it's almost a disincentive for marrying. It didn't really act that way, but you can see, you can see that there was a kind of problem at its very heart. OK, it wasn't treating the individual man as, as an individual, it was basically treating that man as embedded in a, in a, in a domestic context, as, as having a wife, as having three children. So that's fundamental. Uh, 11 of the, the, the examples of its, you know, sort of irrationality or unfairness, if you like, and the other of course is. The woman, the place of the woman in this, we know that women did have dependents. We know that women had dependent. So how do you, how did this evolve? How do we, how, how did the, the state and particularly the arbitration court or commission as it later was called, develop this? Well, um, the, the critical turning point here was the fruit pickers case. I'm sure this is something that's, you know, gonna be on your minds forever. The fruit pickers of 1912 fruit pickers case. Now what did the fruit pickers case involve? Well, This dealt with the problem of the grey areas, this dealt with the problem that in the fruit growing industry, and this is particularly up on the Murray, places like Mildura and and you know, those, those sort of riverland areas. That there were men and women involved in fruit picking. And there were men and women involved in fruit packing, that is picking them off the trees, oops sorry, and packing them in boxes, OK, they were actually things that involved both men and women. So what do you do? What do you do if you're establishing a male breadwinner system, who gets paid what? So Higgins scratches his bald head in 1912, and he says, right, I know how we'll do it, I know how how we'll do it. If the work's predominantly performed by men, And this was the case with fruit picking. It'll attract a male breadwinner's wage, it'll attract the living wage based on harvester. But if the work is predominantly done by women, packing, packing in boxes, it'll only attract what he what was what came to be called a minimum wage, and that was about 54% of the male wage. Now you can see what's happening here. What it's doing is the state intervention. Is actually crafting a sexual division of labour in an industry where it's blurred. So you can see where the how the state intervention works here. It's actually defining, picking as male labour. It's giving employers, frankly, incentives to employ only men in that particular field and of course big incentives to employ only women in packing cos you can pay them less. OK, only a bit more than half of what you have to pay men if it, if that attracted them over. So you can, you can see how this, this works. The, the men are going to gravitate to, to the fruit uh picking, and the, the women are are basically there in the packing, attracting a, uh, The, the lower wage. No, no, uh, man is going to gravitate to that, and the, and a set of norms and expectations will emerge around each of those different types of functions that will see them as either men's work or women's work. OK, so there are big values around the, the, the breadwinner and the dependent that are operating. They're operating within a framework of emerging social policy based on that fundamental masculinism and patriarchy of the male breadwinner concept. Reasonably clear? OK, good. OK, now I won't go into all this in detail, we've already dealt with some of it, but, you know, just let's go back over some of the topics we've looked at, thinking about them in terms of gender, World War 1, World War 2. Very importantly, those of you who you're about to do exams, the number of time I get in times I get in exams, and because the men all went off to to war, uh, in the First World War, women entered industry, I'm told, in Australia. Well, they didn't for the most part. There was no great rush of women into industry, into new jobs, uh, into unconventional jobs in Australia, in, uh, the First World War. There weren't massive labour shortages, uh, um, not, not, not, uh, outside the, the city, I mean, I'm thinking there particularly of of factory employment. And remember Australia doesn't have a highly developed munitions industry or any of the kinds of industries that indeed did absorb very significant numbers of women in Britain. So don't confuse the Australian situation with the British one in the First World War, and don't confuse World War 1 in World War with World War 2, because in World War 2, there was a, a big rush of women into industry, uh, in some cases compulsorily, because remember the government had the power to direct them. OK, so there's a massive movement of women into non-traditional occupations, sometimes, and this is again, you know, the government's fiddling here, what's it do? Women going into industries where there's lots of men, they look like they're doing basically the same work as men, what are you gonna pay them? Well, the government in World War 2 established the Women's Employment Board, which basically came down to about 90%. In the context of the Second World War, it's amazing what necessity will do. OK, if you've got to bind women to to absolutely essential war labour, which is what was happening here, all of a sudden paying them a men's a man's wage or something close doesn't seem so onerous anymore, and the government basically forced employers. To do it. Once the war ends, of course, less sense of necessity, women's wages drift back, uh, about 75%, they kind of settle that in in industries where men and women are doing roughly comparable work. OK, so very interesting, uh, situation in World War II, it kind of shakes things up, but in the end, the male breadwinner system survives the Second World War, it survives into the 1950s for, Uh, Zelda to protest against it in the late 1960s, and we can do this sort of gender lens, I think with a number of topics, so the depression, Construction, um, uh, manufacturing were very, you know, certain parts of heavy industry were very badly affected, and that really shreds male employment in particular, but you go to things like food packaging and processing. Things like that where there's continuing demand because people still have to eat right, and, and of course in those industries where women are more prominent, um, there's the the the levels of unemployment are not quite at those stellar levels that you get with some of the, the, the industries dominated by men that basically shut down like housing construction and and commercial building. So slightly different experiences of, of, of unemployment and underemployment by men and women in the depression. In this case, men might have been more badly affected, on the whole, by by unemployment because of the nature of the industries that they were in, and of course it gives rise to this discourse of of women taking men's men's jobs, um. Uh, the long boom, the period that Nicholas talked about, women's employment was growing faster than men's, but there's no major increase in women's employment in manufacturing, which is growing, at least up to 1960. What that suggests is that many women are going into service industries. They're going into these, you know, developing banking and insurance and and department stores, uh, the consumer and retail economy rather than into into manufacturing. Um, many migrant women join the workforce, OK, so bringing in that aspect, thinking about the ways in which that post-war immigration, uh, influences the developments I'm talking about here. Women were increasingly employed in services and professional work during the 1950s and 1960s. Uh, I won't go, you can read that in your own time, just, uh, some testimony of a young woman growing up with both her parents working in manufacturing in inner Melbourne. The double uh shift if you like, the double load of, of a woman bringing up a family as well as going off to work a night shift in, in the factory. And then the situation in the 80s where you've got lots of new jobs, um, developing 1.4 million new jobs, but 900,000 of them are taken up by women, and a lot of those are part time. You can see different sort of formulations. The way in which it's gonna challenge some of the, the, the, the, the assumptions about how people work, about what they're paid, about, about the, the relationship between work and, and, and life more generally. OK, so you, you can see there, so I won't go into that deal, you can follow that in, in your own time. I'm not gonna do that in, but, you know, think here also of the, the, the, the, the continuing kind of shadow, if you like, of that older economy and the ways in which certain types of labour have been more validated and more valued than others. And we, we see this in politicians constantly putting on high views.
