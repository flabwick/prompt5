SPEAKER 1
I don't know. I don't know, I mean, I think it's hard now for. The coalition, I mean, I, I don't think there's any serious possibility of getting a majority, um, but yeah, I mean they could fall over the line. The problem they've got now, I think, is they've spent so much time insulting the teals, um, and, and then, you know, liberal line media insulting the teals that if it comes down to negotiations, they're gonna be in a weak position, I suspect we'll see. OK, I better get a start. So, um, my acknowledgements to traditional owners, Nanna War Namburi, I pay my respects to elders, people and country. So, today, and again, thank you for coming today. Today is the first of two lectures on the 1980s. My focus here will be on government and policy. My focus tomorrow, and we've got some all sorts of wonderful film and all the rest of it. Assume everything works, uh, will be on business. Um, so two aspects, two different aspects. Obviously, there's uh important intersections, um, but I've, you know, just for the purposes of the two lectures have treated them as, as discrete topics. Um, so, let me take you through. I'll just recap, um, briefly on the later 70s. I showed you this slide last time, but was rushing a bit towards the end. So, just reminding you that the 1975 budget, Uh, the labour budget, the one that was blocked in the Senate, uh, the one that precipitated, uh, the dismissal was at the centre of the dismissal of the Whitlam government, was actually in many ways a, a, um, a budget that prefigured the modern era because it was, um, uh, it moderated increases in government spending, it was preoccupied with bringing down. The budget deficit, uh, the rhetoric that accompanied it was about fighting inflation, which would become the mantra of the 1970s, later 1970s and 1980s, uh, especially for the coalition, for the Liberal Party and the coalition, but also for labour eventually as well. Um, and as I've said, it was blocked in the Senate, not for economic reasons, but for political reasons. I won't go into the loans affair again, but the loans affair, the unorthodox loan raising methods of the labour government, in particular two of its ministers, Jim Cairns and uh more particularly Rex Connor. Um, became, you know, the pretext for the coalition, uh, blocking supply, blocking that budget in the Senate, using its numbers there to defer approving that budget, uh, which culminated in the, uh, dismissal of the government by the Governor General on the 11th of November 1975 on the grounds that it could not fund uh government that basically it wasn't able to secure its supply bills to secure appropriation. So, um, as I mentioned last time, stagflation became a term that was used for that combination of low growth, low, Uh, economic growth, uh, low rates of economic growth and inflation, and unemployment all coming together and with the result that the kinds of, um, Keynesian interventions and management of the economy that had been standard for governments in the 19, well in fact even earlier, I mean the first Keynesian budget in Australia was arguably the first wartime budget, which was November 1939 under the Menzies government, uh and, and you know that. Um, use of government interventions, use of governments, uh, fiscal power to increase or to to to decrease public spending as a way of smoothing out economic cycles of boosting demand or or sometimes suppressing demand in the overall economy, which we associate with Lord Keynes, the the Cambridge economist. Major figure in economic thinking, um, that's coming to an end, that the kinds of methods would not be able to deal with, uh, the problems of uh low growth plus inflation plus unemployment. OK, so the, the, the, the traditional idea that you could basically just increase government spending, it would boost demand, and the, the economy would come back into balance. Uh, was no longer going to work because you had structural, deep structural inefficiencies in the economy, in the allocation of resources within that economy. So those fiscal methods, you know, adjusting government spending in that way were no longer, um, uh, satisfactory. They were no longer found to be working. So, you know, the the Whitlam government had greatly increased government spending. In its 1974 budget, but all that had done was exacerbate the problem of inflation. OK, it hadn't brought the economy back into, uh, um, into a balance because it had stimulated demand, but the economy wasn't able to meet that demand, um, and so essentially you, you had, uh, a worsening of inflation which at one point was sitting at about 20%. As it had been back in the early 50s. And so this mantra of fighting inflation first, the first, of course, was fighting inflation. Once you dealt with that, it was argued then unemployment would eventually come down. OK, so it's a return in many ways to the kinds of economic orthodoxies that were associated with the period of the gold standard, you know, back um uh before the 1940s. Kinds of um deflationary policies that had been circulating and had been pursued during the depression of the 1930s by more conservative governments, uh, more orthodox financial and economic thinkers. And so what this contemplated was the use of unemployment as a weapon for dealing with inflation, that is, you would really deliberately increase the unemployment rate, and this would suppress inflation, it would bring inflation down. OK, that one of the consequences of more people being out of work would be suppression of demand, uh, would be, uh, a, a shift towards more efficient production, and this would bring inflation down to more manageable levels. And, um, this is pursued in Australia. You can see how, how this, um, sorry. You can see how contrary this is to, um, the kind of ethic that, uh, Nicholas Brown was talking about in his lectures on the post-war period, on post-war reconstruction, on the long boom, where he talks about full employment, having become the policy, kind of, um. You know, essentially a bipartisan policy in Australia that all governments would pursue the fullest employment possible. Well, in the context of the economic crises of the 1970s and 1980s, governments are moving away from that idea, they're prepared to use an increase in the unemployment rate to bring down the, the uh level of inflation. Now, in Britain and in the United States at the beginning of the 1980s, this is done in a very drastic way. Uh, the US administration there initially of Jimmy Carter and, and, and soon afterwards of Ronald Reagan and the Thatcher government, the Thatcher Conservative government in Britain, um, the central banks in each instance, the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England in the United Kingdom. Um, there is a deliberate engineering of mass unemployment in the early 1980s in each place. I mean, I think at the peak you had about 3 million people unemployed in Great Britain, in the United Kingdom, for instance, OK. Um, also mass unemployment in the United States, but one of the things this does, Is that it breaks inflation for decades in those places, OK, inflation was brought down to very low levels, uh, Australian governments didn't pursue that sort of rather radical policy, if you like, radically conservative, of course, it's not radical in the sense of being pro-abor. Um, they didn't pursue that radical policy, probably for a range of reasons. One of them was a still extremely empowered union movement. Uh, another was the somewhat limited capacity within Australia's institutional structure for any single government to engineer, uh, high unemployment and low inflation. We've got, you know, a, a, a complex federal system, you've got a reserve Bank in Australia that remained committed, uh, it's, it's, you know, it's charter continued to commit it to, to full employment. I think the strength of the union movement, the strength of the full employment idea remained um very powerful in Australia in the early 1980s, and as a result, Australia doesn't really go down this path, so there's certainly, uh, you know, a strong attempt by the Fraser government initially and then eventually by the Hawke government to bring down inflation. But not with the drastic, um, uh, you know, kinds of uh engineering, if you like, of unemployment that occurred in a number of other countries in this period. OK, and that that means that Australia has a higher inflation rate, than it than its trading partners during the 1980s, and this is undoubtedly a a a a disadvantage to Australia in terms of its overall economic performance. OK, so, um, I talked briefly about the Fraser government last time, 75 to 83, um, in some ways it returns to a 1930s rhetoric of austerity, one of the phrases that, Phrases, phrases that came to be associated with Fraser was life wasn't meant to be easy, which he got he borrowed from George Bernard Shaw, the Irish playwright. Life wasn't meant to be easy, and, uh, this became associated with his generally austere approach to running the economy. But it's important to keep in mind the government wasn't really a prototype for Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher. Um, it doesn't launch a frontal assault on the unions, the unions remain very powerful. Um, spending cuts happened but were more moderate, I think, than in some other jurisdictions around the world in this period. The centralised system of industrial um relations continues, and this is a very important institutional feature. This is one of the things, if you like, that really made the aggressive pursuit of uh inflation, uh, or, you know, uh, aggressive pursuit of, of, um, uh, you know, uh, lower rates of inflation, more difficult. You had uh an industrial relations system. In which the state, in which tribunals of various kinds at both the state level, the sub-national level, and nationally, are still playing a central role in determining wages. And this makes wages the the the term that economists often use is sticky. It makes wages sticky. You can't, um, engineer drastic, uh, you know, uh, decreases in wages if you've got a very dispersed institutional structure. In which wages and conditions are being decided by different, you know, commissioners and judges in different kinds of tribunals and courts across Australia. And so that continues under Fraser. Fraser has no enthusiasm whatsoever for dismantling that long standing centralised industrial relations system. Tariff protection also remains high. There is no drastic move towards free trade in this period. Uh, the White Australia policy is replaced by multiculturalism and by the resumption of significant levels of migration from Asia for the first time really for a century. This is in the second half of the 1970s. And you do have the very modest beginnings of banking reform and financial liberalisation. The government calls uh an inquiry, um and it reported, it was called the Campbell Committee report. And it had quite drastic um recommendations in it for liberalising the financial order, that is, um, uh, reducing the level of regulation around banking and, and also non-banking institutions in Australia, but very little of that is implemented under the Fraser government, and this is very important because this would resume. This this process uh would resume and be radicalised under the labour government that followed, OK, but there, there um isn't really drastic financial liberalisation. So, what you can see here in the Fraser government, 75 to 83 is really for the most part, a continuation of that old, Australian settlement, you know, that that Paul Kelly, I, I was on a panel with Paul Kelly on Sunday morning at the Sorrento Writers Festival, I should have told him we've been talking about Australian settlement. But you recall, you know, the pillars that he has in the Australian settlement, you know, tariff protection, wage arbitration. Uh, state paternalism, much of this remains in place. Much of this remains in place under the Fraser government, the exception really being, well, two exceptions of those five pillars, white Australia and imperial benevolence. Australia is well and truly moved out from under the British umbrella in this period, although obviously very close alliance with the United States. But those other aspects, state paternalism, tariff protection, arbitration, wage arbitration are all still there. Any questions? Is that reasonably clear? Reasonably clear. OK, so main points, you don't get kind of the, the radically conservative poli uh uh politics of fact that would be associated with later with Thatcher and Reagan, um, you get a a a broad continuation of key economic and financial dimensions of the Australian settlement, yeah. What is the bank? Yeah, so things like allowing foreign banks to operate in Australia, it believed the dollar should be allowed to float, it believed that state banks, state-owned banks, government owned banks were now basically redundant. There was no reason for them. So a range of, of, uh, you know, um, liberalising mess that the market should play a much stronger role, um, that the, the kinds of, um, you know, restrictions that still existed around, um, Uh, deposits, for instance, the amount that, that, that trading banks needed to deposit with the Reserve Bank, those restrictions that really went back to the war, you know, they'd been established really as very direct controls, you might remember Selwyn Cornish talked about this a few weeks ago. So they're they're established really in about 1942 as a wartime measure and and in through different measures, different um instruments, they're really continued in the post-war period and it leads to a very highly regulated banking sector. So interest rates are regulated by government, for instance, you know, basically things like home loan interest rates and and the amount. that the banks were lending to home, uh, to, to prospective homeowners. All of that is, is, is highly regulated by government during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s. What the Campbell report was basically saying is that the banks should be given more leeway to do business their own way, rather than being restricted in those kinds of ways by by government. OK. And here are some of the problems of the Fraser government, so you can see there's no return to a golden age, inflation is persistent, you still persistent unemployment, the unions remained strong and pressed for wage increases. You had also very widespread tax evasion during the period, so you had, you know, if you're an executive, for instance, in this period, you might have your employer paying your children's private school fees. As a way of effectively avoiding a cash transaction which would attract income tax, for instance, you know, so all highly illegal now under fringe benefits tax uh legislation, but open to all all sorts of abuses back then. Um, and, and then 1982, 1983, you had a recession drought. There's John Howard, who was treasurer, uh, through some of this period, but by the time you get to 1982, 83, you've got another recession, double digit unemployment, double digit inflation, double digit interest rates, all above 10%, OK, and, and a sense of the economy going nowhere. Yeah. Mm There were, yes, so you're getting the first shoots really in the 19, well in fact it occurs a bit earlier, so there's a bloke called Bert Kelly, who's a South Australian MP and he begins pushing, Oh, I don't know, from about 1963, for, for the winding down of protection. So he'd get up in the parliament, you know, and, and he'd say, you know, this protection thing's no good, it's a racket, whatever. He initially begins modestly by talking about the kind of methods that were being used to decide tariff rates, but it eventually develops into. Full frontal sort of attack on the tariff system. And he's in full flight by the 70s. He's still there, and in full flight, he has columns in newspapers, and, and, um, the, the, the, the emerging, um, right-wing think tanks, uh, some of the more financially literate, I guess, financial journalists, they're listening to him, and they're developing a critique of aspects of this too. So, Yes, um, uh, the, the, the new sort of more what we now call neoliberal, um, uh, economics has its advocates, uh, inside the Liberal Party in the broader political right, and, and so, and actually there are elements even within um the, the labour Party and labour movement. That are sympathetic to these ideas. I mean, Whitlam was quite sympathetic to some of these ideas. He, I mean, Whitlam, you know, regarded protection as a kind of racket, OK, and, and as you know, he did cut tariffs in 1973. But yes, within the Liberal Party, there's a free market lobby already emerging by the 1970s, yeah. OK. Um, so, 1983, the country's not in great shape, um, uh, Australia's in a recession, also has a drought, um, and there is an election more or less due sometime in 1983. Uh, as it turned out, Fraser decided to go early, it was a misjudgment. The labour Party changed its leader from, uh, that man, Bill Hayden, who became leader in 1977. Uh, almost one, went pretty close to winning the 1980 election, got a big swing to the labour Party but not enough. Uh, but in early 1983, the labour Party switches to, um, to Bob Hawke. There he is, um, as leader, just at the moment that Malcolm Fraser back in Canberra, so the labour Party's meeting up in Brisbane. Shadow cabinet up in Brisbane, they changed leadership, just at the moment that um Malcolm Fraser is going out to Government House to ask for an early election. So by the end of the day, Fraser faces Hawke. Who'd been leader of the ACTU president of the ACTU in the 1970s, rather than Hayden, who, uh, agreed to resign in favour of, of Bob Hawke. So this is the 1983 election that will be held in March of that year. Hawke leading the labour Party, he'd been in parliament since 1980, Fraser leading the coalition, leading the Liberal Party, um, in the election now during the election campaign. Uh, the labour Party signs an agreement with the ACTU, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, that Hawke had previously led, and this is called the Prices and Incomes Accord, or sometimes just the accord. Now this is signed in February 1983, so before the Hawke Hawke wins that election, so it's signed while Labor's still in opposition, and what's it do, what's based on a concept called the social wage. And it's based on Ideas that had developed and been applied in Britain during the 1970s by labour governments there, Britain had labour governments from 1974 through to 1979, troubled labour governments dealing with a, you know, frankly a, a declining economy. But one of the things they did was, or developed was this idea of the unions entering into an agreement, a formal agreement with government. And what, what it basically amounted to is unions saying we'll, we'll agree to, to restrain our you know our demands for wage increases, OK, we will, you know, moderate, Our demand, so alright, inflation might be running at at 8%, but we're not gonna expect wage increases of 8% to match the inflation rate, we'll accept less, but you have to give us stuff in return. OK, so it's based on this notion of a kind of social contract between the unions. And a labour government, in this case an opposition about to become a government. Now you might think why unions? Well, unions remain incredibly powerful organisations in Britain and in Australia in this period. They still represent about 60% of wage earners. Their capacity to basically push up inflation was enormous. OK, uh, if, if a major union, such as say the metal workers with 200,000 highly skilled workers, if they got a major wage increase, if they managed to persuade employers and the arbitration commission to give them a wage increase, bang, it goes right through the whole economy. OK, this is the pace setter notion where you have skilled powerful unions who are able to set the pace for less skilled unions. They, they were usually male, it has to be said in this period, they were usually male tradesmen, OK, but in highly strategic parts of the economy, if they got a big wage increase, it had ramifications right through the wage system, and then of course through the whole economy. So that's why governments have an incentive to enter into a formal agreement, that's what labour does before it gets into office. So the idea was, these were some of the things that were inside the first of those agreements. Medicare, so that little green and gold card that sits in your pocket is a product of the prices and incomes accord. OK, Australia did not have a system of national insurance, national health insurance, except very briefly, really, in 1975, 1976, Medibank, which the Fraser government then dismantled as a universal system, so there's nothing after that, and it's there as a trade-off to the unions in return for wage restraint. So Medicare is introduced, In February, 1st of February 1984, it is there in the original accord agreement. OK. So it's a reminder of a world that's passed, you know, that a a a a a reform that consequential really came very much out of the power, the political and industrial power of the unions. OK, back in in 1983, 184. So Medicare is an example, targeted welfare spending, so that the government said we'll spend more on social welfare. OK, we'll, uh, more on social security. Later versions of the accord included superannuation. OK, and eventually compulsory legislated superannuation in 1992. So some of these, uh, you know, institutions we now kind of take for granted, came out of this social wage concept, which lasted from 1983 through to 1996 through all that period of of labour government. People reasonably clear how that works. It's a bargain. It's a signed agreement. We'll moderate, we'll we'll we'll, we won't demand as much at the point of production, you know, over wages, we'll accept slightly lower wages, but you give us stuff in return. OK, so the major expansion of the universities in the later uh 80s and early 90s and tertiary education generally, was also very much a part of this kind of dealing that was going on between the unions and, Eventually the labour government once once it wins office in March 1983. So there's Hawke who becomes the prime minister. The key, uh, partnership, if you like in this government, uh, really right through to 1991, uh, is that between Hawke and Paul Keating as treasurer, Keating's not even 40 at this stage, uh, when he becomes treasurer in 1983. Um, you know, this is a, a, a reformist government. It picks up on a number of the, the kinds of issues that have been sitting there during the 70s and 80s. The governments had nibbled at, the Whitlam government had nibbled at, the Fraser government had nibbled at, and it, it, it basically wins four elect 5 elections eventually in a row, and he's progressively implements a kind of dismantling of much of the old Australian settlement. And the order, as I'll explain in a moment, basically goes financial reform. And then uh uh essentially industrial relation, well, no, in fact, then, uh, tariff reform and then industrial relations reform. OK, that's kind of the order. It doesn't all happen at once, OK, but basically in waves during the 1980s and early 1990s. No coincidence that it's a labour government that gets gets gets to industrial relations reform last. Why? They could. OK, it has an agreement with the unions that basically depends on the old centralised wage system. OK, how could, how could a body like the ACTU, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, enter into an agreement with the government, Unless you had a relatively centralised system of wage determination. You know, so the, the, the, the institutions, the old institutions of industrial relations are really the last to fall in this process of reform. There are criticisms, there were criticisms of the accord at the time. There have been criticisms since. Here are some of them. Unions and the welfare sector said, well, you know, um, government is, is very enthusiastic and the media is very enthusiastic about wage restraint. Business is very enthusiastic about wage restraint, but we're not getting enough in return. So they argued that, you know, they were upholding their end of the bargain. OK, by restraining wages, but that the government was also restraining its spending in ways that weren't offering the full benefits that they believed they were entitled to. So that's one criticism, there's simply not enough not enough in it for the unions. Secondly, business argued, uh, conversely that unions were getting too much, and particularly that unions had too much sway, too much influence over government policy. Very important to keep in mind here that there are also reforms to the institutions of government that allow a greater say for both unions and business in economic policy during the 1980s. Some people call this corporatism. A corporatist approach that brings in major economic interests to the heart of government, but business argued that, you know, this was a labour government and they were particularly uh uh you know, too favourable if you like, to to to union uh influence. Thirdly, many social movements argued that the accord was anti-democratic corporatism, there's that word again, because it was based on dealings between a limited range of interests at the expense of others. So one of the first things the Hawke government does in April 1983 is it calls a national economic summit, and it's held in the House of Representatives chamber at what's now Old Parliament House, was then still Parliament House. And it's interesting, I mean, go in and have a look, there are still videos of this, and if I had time, I'd show you, and you'll notice it's a sea of suits. You look at the room, and there's, you know, probably I don't know, a couple 100 people in there, and they're all basically men in suits. OK, and of course they're union leaders and they're business leaders. Only one woman had speaking rights at the National Economic summit, Cabinet minister Susan Ryan. OK. The um environmental movement, conservation movement, uh, indigenous welfare advocates, um, they were either excluded or they were given virtually token representation. So the Australian Council of Social Service has, I think, one representative there. Amidst this massive group of business and union and other leaders, so it's based on a kind of limited understanding or limited sense of the interests that matter. Indigenous people aren't represented. OK, so the argument against this kind of accord, um, you know, process is that it excluded key interests from a role in decision making. It privileged the powerful economic interests of unions and business. And 1/4 argument that's come out of more recent academic critique really, Marxism, political economy approaches, basically says that look, what the accord was really, was a way of co-opting union leaders. Into the economic and political order, it gave union leaders a privileged place in determining, shaping government policy, and that what it did was it effectively tamed the unions, the greater union militancy that had been around in the 1970s, you know, the unions calling a general strike when the Fraser government was dismantling Medibank, for instance. I remember it well, my dad took me to the beach. I thought general strikes were a good thing. Um, it's about 1976. Uh, so that greater union militancy of the seventies, they argue, was essentially dampened and or blunted through the accord process because it brought union leaders, but not the rank and file, but union leaders into the heart of government at the expense. Of, you know, a kind of more activist militant unionism, better able to, to fight for working class interests. That's the argument that is put by, uh, that, that particular group. Elizabeth Huntry is a, a, a Sydney scholar, um, has elaborated that, I think most fully and, and very interestingly. OK, so criticisms of the court. And here's this takes us back to the question about what's happening in the Liberal Party and the free market lobby business, because yes, they're active in the 70s, but it's kind of lone voice stuff. It's, it's still pretty isolated, not terribly powerful, look rather marginal. Milton Friedman visits Australia in the 70s, you know, the, the sort of apostle of monetarism or uh uh a prophet of monetarism, you know, he's brought out by one of the think tanks. I mean, all this is happening, but, It's in the 80s, the, the, the, the, what's, you know, now called, what was then called the new right really comes into its own, and it has a number of dimensions. So you've got a labour government, but you've also got a kind of insurgency, if you like, over on the political right um around economic and industrial and other issues too, also around issues of immigration and race, so. Um, has a number of dimensions here. The mining industry ran a successful campaign against national land rights for indigenous people in 1984-1985, 1983 to 1985, which basically uh destroyed any prospect of national land rights legislation, despite that being government policy. You had the historian Geoffrey Blainey campaigning against the level of Asian immigration. To Australia, arguing it was too high for social cohesion, was coming at a time of high unemployment, so, There's agitation from the rights, particularly from the mining industry, Hugh Morgan was one of those around Aboriginal land rights, but you're also getting people criticising Asian immigration. Fourthly, you have another group that coalesced in a body called the HR Nicholls Society. I won't go into the reasons for that, but HR Nichols was a, an early critic of the arbitration system in Australia, and that gives you a hint about what this group of people like. They, um, like free markets, they don't like unions, they don't like the arbitration system, they basically suggest markets should be deciding levels of wages, not courts, not tribunals, not commissions. Um, they want individual, uh, industrial relations reform, uh, towards individual contracts and away from, you know, a central role for unions in the process of determining wages and conditions, away from a central role for tribunals and commissions. So they want to dismantle the old arbitration system. So that's another group. And then finally, you have um a a a a much more militant approach from the farming lobby in the National Farmers Federation. It's anti-union, it's anti-tariff protection, so it returns in many ways to ideas that farmers had had back in the 1920s, that tariffs, high protection were not in their interest because it increased the cost of farming inputs. Because it made the, the, the challenge of placing their own products on markets harder because other countries would retaliate against Australia's tariffs. So anti anti-union, they want lower lower wages, lower wage costs, but also anti-tariff protection. And what's interesting is that the National Farmers Federation. Um, they actually fund a number of employers who take on the unions, and these become kind of emblematic industrial disputes of the 1980s. In general, the level of industrial disputation drops markedly in the 1980s. Why? Why do you think? Why does the level of strikes go down? What have the unions done? They've signed up to an agreement, right? OK, so the union leaders want to keep them at work, they're not gonna strike lightly. So the levels of of of dispute goes down. In the context of that accord, but you have a number of individual disputes that are kind of used almost as theatre, by the political right, by the anti-union, anti-Labor right. One of them was in a kind of marginal sort of um cattle cattle concern in northern New South Wales where, I think the guy was, was sort of rounding up wild cattle and slaughtering them for, for, for consumption. He took on the unions, um, CE, which I've got there was an electricity dispute, it's a bit different because it involved a confrontation between the conservative government in Queensland of Queensland. And the electricity workers, so it's a slightly different case. Dollar Sweets, a tiny confectionary company in Melbourne, but a very high profile conflict between a militant union there and a um uh um um a manufacturer. OK, which was again used by industrial relations reformers on the right as propaganda, and finally quite a big one at Robe River in Western Australia. These are iron these are iron ore miners. This was a big one, OK, and, and, and, uh, uh, a major confrontation, this involved, yeah, about about 1300 workers up in the Pilbara. OK, all of these, they, they're kind of high profile, um, disputes, and they're being kind of um framed within a struggle over the future of the industrial relations system in which you have people on the right, in the new right, who are arguing for, you know. A tax on union power, for the courts, for the common law to be used against unions, for the dismantling of centralised industrial relations, for the role that markets should play in determining wages and conditions, not tribunals. OK, so you can see that's, yes. Yeah, so the you say what what they wanted to do, Peter Costel people heard of Peter Costello, who was a treasurer in the Howard government. This is where he cuts his teeth, the Dollar Sweets dispute in Melbourne. And basically, uh, it was the idea that, um, uh, employers shouldn't, they should just forget about the the industrial tribunals, they should simply sue the unions for losses. OK, that was the, the basic idea that that um the new right was pushing during this period. OK. So, as I said, as I said, the government turns initially to financial reform, and the big reforms, the first of them, and perhaps the biggest of them, is the decision to float the dollar in December 1983. OK, this effectively was Australia responding a long, long way down the track, 12 years to what the United States had done. Do you remember when? I talked about it last time, I think. Do you remember when, when did the United States effectively float its dollar? When did, when did it go off the gold standard? 1971. OK, so Australia had remained essentially for fixed currency, a currency that was still regulated by officials, via a daily meeting right through all those years, right through to 1983. OK, and this was defended by, for instance, senior figures in Treasury as a way of dealing with inflation, for instance, as one of the instruments for dealing with inflation. That Australia could avoid, um, uh, you know, the, the using unemployment to deal with inflation, by using, um, the level of value of the Australian dollar to deal with that, OK? So, um, it, it was, you know, considered an instrument that could be used to deal with the problem of, of inflation. OK, so the dollar is floated by the government in 1983. Uh, basically what this amounts to is a decision that it'll be the markets, the financial markets that determine the level of the dollar. When the markets want Australian dollars, its value will go up. When the markets are selling Australian dollars because they lack confidence in the economy, its level will go down. But the idea was that this would have a balancing mechanism in it. OK, if the value of the dollar goes down, of course, it should stimulate exports, OK, and that would help to bring the economy back into, into balance. OK, so this, this was the kind of the theory behind it. There were other financial reforms in the period, a decision to allow foreign banks. To have licences, so there was a decision made to allow 16 foreign banks to have licences from mid 1985, and in 1986, in the middle of a balance of payments crisis that I'll come to you in a moment, restrictions on foreign investment were also eased, OK, to allow foreigners to invest in Australian companies with fewer checks and restrictions. OK, so, generally a kind of financial liberalisation going on here. OK. I mean, to, to give you an example of how the dollar was the way in which the dollar was fixed before December 1983, is that 4 officials each morning would decide what its level should be. There'd be an official from Prime Minister's department, there'd be an official from Treasury, from the Department of Finance, and from the Reserve Bank. And they all sit down together and decide what the day. Now the problem with this was a little bit what I was describing I think in the last lecture, that it, it essentially, because they tended to act in predictable ways, it meant that traders were kind of able to make money. By simply anticipating what the decision would be. OK, because they were effectively acting in highly predictable ways, that it was a kind of a, a winning gamble, and a kind of a bet you couldn't lose if you're a trader, because you, you really knew when it, when, when the officials were gonna increase or decrease the value of the Australian dollar because you knew about the kinds of things that they were responding to in the broader economy, OK? What Keating said, who was treasurer when it floated, he said now, The traders, these, these speculators, traders if you like, would be betting against one another, and this was healthier for the economy. It wouldn't be a case of actually betting against the government itself. Tax reform is one of the things the government also takes on in this period, and I've already mentioned one of those taxes, uh, that was introduced in the mid 1980s, uh but they introduced capital gains tax, so kind of a, a, a, a tax on, on, uh, you know, major profits if you sold a particular shares or if you sold uh property. Uh, land, other property at a, at a, at a, you know, a great profit that the government would claim a certain percentage of that as a tax, fringe benefits tax I've already mentioned, so these are things like benefits that you receive from your employer. Now a subject to tax, so you know, even in our department over there, if, uh, Maria Nugent, our head of school, takes out a bunch of staff to some lunch for for Christmas or whatever, that has to be declared. The university has to declare that because it attracts a fringe benefits tax. Obviously it's a trivial amount of money, but we are legally obliged to do that. OK, where it's an employee who is receiving the benefit, to take just a trivial example. Uh, there were cuts to income tax rates. The top rate in 1983, 60% for very high levels of, of, of earning. Um, it was reduced to 49%. OK, it was reduced to, to, to, to 4, so significant reduction in the top level, um, but the argument was that, you know, what governments were losing from high income earners, uh, in income tax by bringing the top rate down, they were gaining through these other taxes, FBT and capital gains. Um, there were business tax cuts and also the removal of the double taxation of share dividends. This is the franking credits thing that we heard about in the election a few years ago. So, um, basically what was happening here is that companies were paying tax, and then when a shareholder in a company got their shares, they paid tax on that income to, it's a form of double taxation, so that was um abolished in, in, in this period. Um The government flirted with the idea of a consumption tax, a goods and services tax. Paul Keating wanted one. Uh, but, uh, union opposition and indeed even some business opposition meant that it wasn't adopted. OK, Hawke opposed it, other members of cabinet opposed it, uh, Keating, uh, lost out in that particular debate. Australia didn't adopt a consumption tax until what, 15 years later, as a result of that. So tax reform, um really responding I think to some of the uh revelations about, uh, tax evasion uh that had occurred in the 19 early 1980s. Now 1986 is a period of crisis, not a recession, but a balance of payments crisis, and it's sometimes remembered as the banana republic crisis. What happened? Well, the first thing that happened is that there was downward pressure on the prices of Australian export commodities. Now you know about the, there's a story you've heard once or twice in this course already. When else did it happen? 1930, 1890, you've got it happening here again in 1986. It's exposing the vulnerabilities of an economy that relies heavily on the export of a limited range of commodities. You've also got high levels of protection, you've got a kind of tariff war. Same sort of thing we're seeing now going on between Europe and the United States in which Australia is basically caught up. So you've got that going on as well. So what happens is the the the very familiar scenario that we saw in 1930 as well, a balance of payments crisis, that is, Australia is earning less in the world than it's spending on imports. Opening up a gap. Opening up a gap. OK, and this was understood as, you know, having the potential to actually plunge the economy into a 1930s style, uh, depression, or at least a recession. The dollar collapses, so whereas, you know, it basically had something like parity with the American dollar, it declines to about 50 cents. OK, so 50 cents American, $1 Australian, so there's a, it's a measure of the declining confidence of the money markets in the Australian economy. But what happened then was very interesting. The reforms that had been brought in in 1983, 1984 kind of worked. They kind of worked during 1987. With political consequences because the government is re-elected in mid 1987. As the economic indicators turn around. The the government cuts its spending. But there's also an improvement in commodity prices. Government has no control over that, of course, that's the world market. But the other thing that happens is there's a rise in manufacturing activity and in exports, taking advantage of the lower Australian dollar. OK, cause remember what happens when a dollar, when, when the value of the currency declines, a couple of things happen. Your exports are more competitive in the world. So it's probably gonna result in export recovery, but it also gives your manufacturers, your local producers advantages over imports. Because people, uh, there is, if, if you like less foreign currency in the country to buy those imports. OK, those imports are less competitive against the locally produced product. So it also boosts domestic industry. When the value of your own currency plunges against key trading partners, that's what happened in 1986, and the recovery of 1987 is based on those economic indicators. Now, I am out of time, so I'm not gonna continue. What I'll do, I won't give you the a pitch for a thesis. What I'll do in the next lecture in the beginning, is I'll just give you a background to the the period of the later 1980s. Um, and then we'll plunge into a discussion of, uh, business. Now, it's actually a useful point at which to finish, because it really is in a lot of ways, 1987 is a pivotal moment in all this because the stock market collapses in New York. OK, so it is a bus a kind of business collapse that has all sorts of ramifications for both business and government in the later 19.
