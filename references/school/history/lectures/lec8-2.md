SPEAKER 1
Righto, OK, let's go. OK, so I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we're meeting in the Nanna and Namburi and pay my respects to people, elders, and country. So welcome back, uh, everyone, um, after the Easter break, who had a look at the Fletcher Jones film? Yeah, it's really good, don't you think? I really like it. Um, yeah, it's sort of captures a kind of aspect of Australian history that you don't often see captured actually in in documentary films, so um. Be very interested in your, your thoughts on that, perhaps we'll um we can talk about that at some point today, if we have a bit of time, if not, um, certainly talk about it with your, your tutors, um. So, uh, yes, uh, I'm lecturing again today, uh, end of the, the long boom, um, so it's picking up really where Nicholas left off with his, uh, long boom lecture, and, um, let's get into it. OK, so, um, to recap really, um, on, uh, the long boom itself, which uh Nick talked about, David Lee talked about in relation to mining. Uh high rates of economic growth, so the average between the early 60s and the mid 70s, 61 to 74, is 4.8%, which is basically the same kind of growth rates that you were getting in that other long boom that we've talked about in this course, which was when? When was the other long boom, if you like, in Australian settler economic history? Which one? Yeah, so basically between the gold rushes and the depression in the second half of the 19th century, so very similar kinds of rates of economic growth as far as they can be calculated, of course for the earlier period, the kind of national accounting that um produces these kinds of figures, uh, was invented really in the 1930s, OK, so, um, you know, there are obviously um challenges in, in dealing with early periods. Um, rising prosperity, so per capita GDP per individual, not, um, just overall growth rates, was still 2.5%, still 2.5, OK, so, um, you know, lower than the overall growth rate, but that still meant that that people were getting on average wealthier during this, during this period as as Nicholas talked about. Unemployment was generally low, people talk about full employment during this period. It was usually under 2%, which is kind of standard turnover for a capitalist economy, um, uh, low with, with of course that notable exception which I'll come back to the early 1960s, that the credit squeeze when it did go up a little bit. Uh, generally low inflation too for much of this period, so governments are worried about inflation, um, but in general, um, it's kept well and truly under control, you can see there, it's, it's at about 2.5% in the 1960s. As you know, relatively high immigration, given the size of the population, this is the period of the mass immigration programme, it takes off about 1947. It also draws, of course, on non-British migrants, uh, we've assisted migration for the first time, so there's been non non-British migration in the past, otherwise I wouldn't be standing before you. But, uh, assisted non-British migration, um, is a feature of that post-war period, um. And and the development of a consumer economy, which I talked about for the interwar years in an early lecture, but it really takes off in the post-war era, as again, as Nicholas talked about, the rise of car ownership, the rise of home ownership, um, homes full of all those um uh electrical appliances and all the rest of it. This is the the the, you know, the long boom, really the high water mark of industrial Australia, so it's 29% of the economy, very similar proportion of the workforce, around 1960 on the eve of the mining boom, 1961, you've got there. OK, so it's an industrial economy, it looks like a mature industrial economy. David Lee talked about the mining boom, important to keep in mind, it's mainly an investment boom for much of the 1960s, OK, the mining itself only really takes off towards the end of that decade. Um, trade with Asia is developing, um, trade with China began in a significant way in the late 1950s, particularly in wheat, um, and, uh, John Hawkins, we'll talk about that in a future, uh, lecture. Um, but Japan, especially, as both of our previous lecturers talked about, becomes very important. It's Australia's largest export market by 1967. That's when it, it, it basically, uh, overtakes, uh, the United Kingdom. And it's a period of international economic stability underwritten by generally high rates of economic growth in various developed economies, but also the institutions and the order that was established coming out of the Second World War. And Nick talked about in an early lecture. So the the term, the affluent society, it's, it's JK Galbraiths, and Nick mentioned that book by the American economist, adviser to John F. Kennedy. In fact, he becomes ambassador Kennedy's ambassador to India. Um, uh, that was the name of the book he wrote. It's a, it's, it's also a very good description for Australia in this period of the 1960s. But what about the vulnerabilities? Well, again, Nicholas spoke about some of these. One of those is tariff protection, which increases during the 1960s. At the same time as the first really significant critiques of tariff protection emerge really for the first time since the 1920s. OK, so you get criticisms in the financial press from a a a relatively, still relatively small group of financial journalists. You get the first significant criticisms emerging within the parliamentary ranks. There was a kind of dissident South Australian Liberal MP called Bert Kelly, uh who uh was also a columnist. He wrote for the press but was um beginning to develop a critique of the high levels of uh tariff protection in Australia, the term that was given to this in the 60s, Um, or perhaps more subsequently than in the 60s was McEwanism because the trade minister of the period, the Country Party leader John McEwen, is the major proponent of high tariffs as a means of national development during the 1960s. Tariffs go up as the import. The licencing system is dismantled, so tariffs become the key instrument for controlling trade, for trying to protect Australia's balance of payments during the 1960s. They weren't really needed in the same way in the 1950s because of that import licencing system that Nick talked about. But tariff protection, of course, um helps to um accentuate various kinds of inefficiencies within Australia's manufacturing system, in particular, OK, that it it tends to, To protect industries against competition with, with uh corresponding uh negative effects on prices, prices tend to go up for consumers and also problems of quality, OK, and these were emerging, beginning to emerge in things like the relatively new car industry, for instance, but we shouldn't take these critiques too far. Australia was actually exporting cars in the 1960s to Asia. On in a small way, most cars were being produced for the home market, but um certainly, you know, those inefficiencies are developing and they're also being increasingly critiqued or criticised um uh within uh among a minority at this stage. The the general consensus remains in favour of tariffs as a means of national development, of course you have powerful vested interests, unions, uh industry that wanted tariffs to be kept high. You had highly regulated banks, but remember what um Selwyn Cornish talked about a few weeks ago, um, less regulated non-banking institutions like building societies, they're not subject to the same prudential supervision, the same restrictions and regulation. As the major banks, a vulnerability in the system really would come out in the 1970s when there were runs on building societies and you had, you know, state premiers like Don Dunstan and Neville Wran basically, you know, standing outside the building societies with um. Loud hailers reassuring people that their savings were safe. OK, so we end up, that's the situation we end up with in the sort of later 70s and early 80s and it's partly, you know, expressing, reflecting a vulnerability in the system. There's much less regulation of those non-banking institutions. Inflation um uh re-emerges as an issue, particularly in the late 1960s and early 1970s, um, that late period of the long boom. I'll talk about the reasons for that in a moment. Occasional unemployment, as I mentioned, most obviously during the credit squeeze corresponding of course, or coinciding with the 1961 election which Menzies and the coalition almost lost. I mean, Calwell, labour went within two seats of uh of basically winning that election, it was a two seat majority. Uh, white Australia in the Cold War, all of these provide kind of, I suppose, vulnerabilities in a world that's changing rapidly. OK, uh, the White Australia policy, Australia's highly restrictive racialized immigration policy, looked incredibly or increasingly anomalous in the 1960s, at a time when, You know, Australia and other Western countries are talking about freedom and democracy, they're fighting wars in Asia, at the same time as they say, well, we'll fight wars in Asia, but Asians can't come into the country. OK, and at a time when Asian economies are becoming more dynamic, most obviously, Japan. OK, so we wanted to trade with Japan, but the idea of of immigrants from Asia still remained deeply problematic. There is liberalisation of the White Australia policy from 1966 onwards when Harold Holt becomes Prime Minister, replacing Menzies. But broadly speaking, the policy remains in place even after that. Just that governments tended not to talk about it as much. OK, so that's the vulnerability in a world that's that's shifting. And union militancy too is becoming more of a thing in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In many ways, you know, that generation of union leaders, uh, union officials who'd, um, experienced, uh, you know, two world wars, a depression, um, there was, even amongst, you know, the communists, and they led a number of these unions, there was a caution. About how much you would demand, about how far you would go, a fear that if you demanded too much, that it would rebound against you, OK, that, that it would destabilise the economy, that it would see the return of inflation, that it may stimulate unemployment. Now, what's happening by the time we get to the late 60s and early 70s is that generation is literally dying off. Blokes didn't live very long. I actually had to look this up for a reason last night. You know, life expectancy in this period for blokes is still basically hovering around 60, 65. OK, you did not live very long. And so these old union leaders, guys like Jim Healy, for instance, the great communist leader of the Waterside Workers' Federation, I think. He dies in 1961, if I remember rightly, that generation is like, they're being replaced by more adventurous union leaders who are less constrained by the kind of culture of austerity that surrounded the depression and war. OK. So, um, I'll talk a bit more about that in a moment actually. What are some of the manifestations of the end of this long boom? So here we're looking at the surface appearances, what's it look like, and what I'll try to do and the rest of the lecture really is to look under the bonnet. What's what's driving it? So here are some of its manifestations. Firstly, higher unemployment. Higher levels of unemployment, eventually, a return to levels of unemployment, That had not been seen since the 1930s, cause remember from about 1942 onwards, the problem is in unemployment, the problem is you couldn't get enough workers. OK, that's a huge problem during the Second World War, and it would remain a problem after the Second World War, even with mass immigration. OK, that structural unemployment that had been a feature of the Australian economy from about the 1890s through to the beginning of the Second World War. Is returning It's returning, OK, initially, you know, it's above 5%, 0 that's not too bad, but it was certainly bad by post-war standards, and of course eventually it would rise much higher than that into into double figures during bad periods. Higher inflation, remember, as I showed you before, inflation, broadly speaking, was under control during the long boom, but look what's happening. The average rate of inflation during the 1970s is 9.8%. It is just under 10%. What is it now? We've been worrying about inflation lately. 3. OK. So I think at its peak in the recent inflation. We got just under 8%, I think, very briefly, but not for a whole year, very brief. So this is the average for the 1970s. What this means is there are actually periods where it's a lot higher than this because there are also periods where it's lower. So there's a period around what, 1974, where I think uninflation's back up around early 1950s levels of about 20%, OK? And I'll get to this next in the next lectures when I lecture on the 1980s, but, The rate of inflation in the 80s is actually rather similar. So this is now locked in. OK, again, there'll be periods where it's lower, periods where it's higher, but inflation rates, the average inflation rate during 70s and 80s is around this level that you can see here, about um around 10%. What often happens during periods of economic downturn, it had happened in the 19 or 1890s, it had happened again in the 1930s, lower rates of immigration, lower rates of population growth. OK, often with deleterious consequences on economic growth. OK, so lower rates of immigration. You can see all of those little planks, if you like, that had made up the long boom, not all of them. Consumer economy remains robust as it had during the depression, but you can see what's happening here. Lower rates of per capita income growth, look at it, not under 1% compared to the figure that I showed you before for the long boom, which was 2.5%. OK, lower rates of growth, lower rates of of of income per capita income. The term that was given to this combination of high unemployment, lower rates of growth was stagflation. Stagflation. OK, the idea of a stagnant economy. OK. Stagnant yet inflationary. And this was the problem that governments, policymakers had to deal with through the 1970s and 1980s, and they had to do it in an economy that still lacked sophistication, particularly the export economy. Australia's export economy of the 1960s and 1970s into the 1980s was much less sophisticated even than today. OK, it's very heavily dependent on a a a narrow range of agricultural commodities, and, and wool and wheat are very important. Some um minerals are becoming more important, as David Lee talked about coal being one of them. But it's it's a, a relatively unsophisticated uh export economy in particular. So why, now, now we're gonna look under the hood. Why did the long boom end and not surprisingly, we can't simply focus on domestic factors, OK, Australia has an open and a closed economy in a way. It's very closed in certain respects with its protectionism. 1950s import licencing and all the rest are very regulated in many ways, high levels of labour regulation and so on, but at the same time it's also a very open one. OK, it's an export economy, it's very vulnerable to external shocks when the capital flows stop. The Australian economy is in trouble, as happened in 1930, for instance, and and in and in 1891. OK, commodity prices drop, more trouble, more trouble, you're gonna have a balance of payments problem. And if you've got fixed currencies, which is what we have in the post-war era, and a balance of payments problem, you're in real strife. OK, basically, it denudes your gold reserves. OK, so, Um, international factors matter a lot, and the world that there is a kind of decline going on in the robustness of the world economy, a world economy still dominated by the United States in the early 1970s. What's happening? Well, firstly, The United States is becoming less dominant because two important powers, defeated powers from the Second World War, have now recovered. OK, they're, um, almost miraculous post-war recovery under the American umbrella. And that's we're talking here about Western Europe and particularly Germany, West Germany and Japan, and their post-war bounce back, um, which had been so dynamic during the 1950s and 1960s, was also coming to an end. OK, they're becoming less dynamic economies as they establish themselves because they've been so successful. OK. So, um, Whereas in, you know, Japan, for instance, is a major, uh, becoming a major importer of Australian steel, and that would continue into the 1970s, the Japanese economy is also becoming more mature and moving from things like construction, drawing on steel to electronics, which of course, you know, Japan's still a major electronics uh exporter. OK, and on it goes. Um, cars, Japanese cars, OK. So, that post-war bounce back's coming to an end, lower rates of growth as a, as a result. Um declining labour discipline and rising material expectations in the late 60s. So the patterns I described for Australian union leaders are happening everywhere. OK, the union leaders who had been so integrated into the British, the British war effort. OK, in World War II, that generation. Is also passing away and you're getting a a a more militant um shop steward, led on the floor of of of factories and so on. Um, approach to labour relations, OK, um, so a lot of the older restraints that had been there during the 1950s coming out of the Second World War are starting to, uh, fall away, and of course inflation is one of the factors. As soon as you get higher levels of inflation, you're gonna get higher wage demands, and that's one of the things that's happening as the economy. stabilising, there are more incentives for unions to demand more. But also these explosive consumer economies of this period, and you know, when I say Western Europe, we're not just talking about the the the the really obvious cases of, you know, West Germany and France, you know, even countries that have been very important to Australia in the post-war period like Italy have got their act together. Italy by the 1960s is a dynamic industrial economy. OK, so all of this is producing a different sort of situation, um. Uh, rising material expectations, consumer demand, declining labour discipline, increasing strike levels, and, and it is fundamentally destabilising, but it's all being driven by big structural changes in the economy, as, you know, the, the, the kind of American dominated post-war order is giving way to something else during the 1960s and 1970s. There are also strains on the international financial system, and I'll dig down into those in a moment, and as I've already said, the return of inflation from the later 1960s. So let me have a look at some of the reasons for that. So we've already talked about the Bretton Wood system, um, you know, this is a part of the post-war order, it's invented in 1944. Bretton Woods was the site of the conference. It's in Connecticut, I think, from the United States. Basically pegged exchange rates. Which was set up at the end of World War 2, are now under strain. So the the the the ways that these um um currencies worked is that they were essentially on a gold standard, which meant that they were that they were stable against each other, is probably the simplest way of putting that, they're stable against each other. That doesn't mean they never moved, they did move, but they only moved within certain limits. They only moved within certain limits. You didn't have wild fluctuations based on demand and supply of the currencies, based on trading. OK, you had much more limited movements of these currencies against one another, and this was deliberately designed to avoid the kind of beggar thy neighbour policies of the depression era, where you had, you know, devaluations, radical devaluation to try and make your, your, your exports more competitive and to boost your domestic industry, and then. Another country would just devalue against you and all that was happening was a kind of destabilisation of international trade. This was designed to stabilise it, but it's coming under all sorts of strain by the time we get to the late 1960s and early 1970s. 1 of the reasons for that is that global financial markets are becoming more liberalised. How can I explain this? Um, there were severe restrictions on what's called convertibility coming out of the Second World War. You couldn't just, you know, wander down to the street with 10,000 Australian pounds or whatever and say, I, I'll have some US dollars, thanks. No, there were laws against this sort of stuff. OK, there were all sorts of and and this was a part of initially the dollar shortage, that there's a kind of global famine of US dollars because the United States didn't want anything that the rest of the world was producing in that period because it was so industrially dominant, I exaggerate, but you know, you can see if you've got one dominant power, very hard for other countries to get enough American dollars. So it's. It's initially about that, but also broadly speaking, it was um a stabilising thing that you restricted convertibility between currencies as a way of ensuring a broad stability in their value between one another and against gold, which remained the kind of standard against which, you know, this was being measured. So, um, Uh, you'll recall I talked about how the gold standard, I won't go into that here, I talked about how the gold standard worked in in an earlier lecture. And, and it's in place in this period. So, so you're getting flows of speculative capital. But it's at the edges, right, because the currency's not moving drastically against one another, but you're getting capital that is actually flowing between different financial markets in order to get the profits at the edges. Because what's happened of course in a a a relatively stable system is that the movements of currencies are actually quite predictable. OK, people who knew what they were doing and the traders did were basically getting guaranteed profits because you generally knew what the, the central banks or the officials, whoever was doing the the setting of the currency each day, and it was in Australia every single weekday. OK, they'd sit down, 3 officials, eventually it was 4 officials, and they'd set the currency, the level of the currency. Against a basket of currencies from Australia's trading partners, that's how it worked. OK, I'll talk more about how it's dismantlement in the next couple of lectures, but that's how it worked. But basically, once as a trader, you understood the principles that were being followed by the officials, you couldn't lose. OK, you couldn't lose. It was like having a a a kind of foolproof betting system. Do they exist, you horse racing fans? I don't know, but anyway, it was like a foolproof betting system. OK, so that's happening, you're getting, you know, significant flows of capital to take advantage of this relatively stable system in which there was nonetheless some movement of currencies. Now, another destabilising thing is sort of has echoes of today, doesn't it? The US was running current account deficits, particularly against those two dynamic countries of this period, West Germany and Japan, the comeback kids. OK, so in other words, in other words, the United States is is buying the products coming out of these economies, all those lovely, you know, cassette recorders and Japanese cars and beautiful German cars and all the rest of it. They have undervalued currencies which gives them a trading advantages. OK, and meant that they were running trade surpluses with the biggest economy, the United States, OK? It it is, it's a fundamentally destabilising aspect of this order. It's creating pressures within the system. And as I've said, you get the return of inflation. One driver of it was the Vietnam War, which cost a fortune to fight. And another, happening at exactly the same time as the Vietnam War was a significant expansion in the US welfare state under President Johnson, under Lyndon Johnson. OK, the Great Society programme, you know, all sorts of programmes to eliminate poverty, um, uh, various forms of uplift and uh medi Medicaid for, for, for poor, for, you know, American poor, expansions of, of educational provision, a whole range of, of, uh, socially progressive uh measures. But all happening at the same time as this administration is fighting an expensive war in Indochina. This is inflationary. How does the US pay for it? Well, that tried and true method, particularly of dominant economies, just press the print button. Just press the print button, print money. OK, which, you know, it happened in the First World War, particularly, happened in the Second World War 2, Print money, so that's one thing, and again, this, this is inflationary, this is inflationary. So how does the uh US administration respond to these pressures that are building up, it's the deficits, the trade deficits running with these big dynamic economies, these growing dynamic economies in Asia, Japan, and in uh Western Europe. Well, the Nixon administration takes the United States off the gold standard. It basically brings the Bretton Woods order to an end. OK? It's a floating currency. From this point on, from this point on, those traders with their bets will basically be betting against one another, as Paul Keating would put it later in an Australian context. OK. The idea was that the currency would find its own level. OK, uh, and, uh, you know, if, if uh there was confidence in that currency, there'd be investment, so on, if there was a lack of confidence, there'd be capital flight, um, that the market would play a stronger role, the government would no longer be uh directing things, so it was a way of producing a greater flexibility. But of course, it is also internationally destabilising. It means that a lot of the verities and certainties of that post-war order are being pulled away in in the early 1970s. Uh, another factor was, uh, the OPEC oil crisis as it's called, in which a number of um Middle Eastern, Middle Eastern countries in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, the, the, um, Arab, what is it, the 4th, um, Arab-Israeli war as it was called, used to be called, um, they um quadruple the price of oil. They formed a cartel and they quadruple the price of oil. Now the problem with that for the international economy is very clear, the whole international economy runs on oil, OK, it's it's incredibly dependent on oil. And that's inflationary, OK, that has another inflationary effect in an economy that's already a global economy that's already inflationary, that's experiencing lower levels of growth, but continuing levels of high demand, it's inflationary. OK, so these are some of the, the sort of broad external factors that are uh providing the context for, Australia's situation. What about domestically? So here's some domestic factors. Australia has an overvalued exchange rate in the 1970s. I mean these things are all relative, these things are all relative, but economists were arguing that it was an overvalued exchange rate, that it had been set at a higher level than the broad parameters of the economy should have dictated if it had been set by the market. Now governments were doing this, this was effectively the work of government in this period, governments controlled this through their officials, um, uh, the Reserve Bank did have some role, but only as one among several institutions in setting the level of the currency each day. But overvaluation of the Australian dollar aimed to stem the inflow of foreign capital because that was inflationary. This was an anti-inflationary measure. If you overvalued the Australian dollar, you'd get less foreign capital flowing into the country, less liquidity, less money in circulation. Um, but the problem with that is that overvaluation also reduced exports. It made exporters less competitive. So not surprisingly, this question of where to set the Australian dollar was a huge matter of contention between the Liberal Party and the Country Party, the coalition partners, because the Country Party on the whole, wanted a devalued currency because it would help exporters of wool and wheat. OK, whereas the Liberal Party representing more urban interests, uh, and concerned about inflation tended to favour overvalued exchange rates as a way of controlling levels of inflation, uh, as, as, as, um, uh, you know, effectively a way also of propping up a domestic industry. OK, cause it, it, it would increase the spending power of an Australian dollar on the ground in Australia, would allow people to buy, um, uh, you know, essentially goods. Through their their overvalued currencies, OK, so, overvaluation reduced exports and increased imports, it, it allowed people to buy um uh those imports. Growing industrial militancy, which I've talked about and large wage increases that occur, especially during the Whitlam era, 1973, 1974, the government, the Whitlam government used the public service as a pacesetter, so it increased public service salaries as a way of encouraging private industry also to increase their salaries. OK, so this is a deliberate strategy, a deliberate design. That uh you know, if you increased clerical, the cost of the price of clerical labour in the public service, private employers would be forced to to put up their wages as well, and also the institution of equal pay for men and women did have economic impacts, OK, we celebrate it quite rightly as a uh a social justice and an advance, but of course it has short-term economic impacts. And thirdly, is what was called, um, this key article here was 1976, the Gregory effect, and this is kind of Australia's version of what's been called the Dutch disease really. Bob Gregory you'll still see around campus, by the way, he's still with us, still hanging around here, and he wrote this absolutely critical article had an enormous impact on the way in which people understood the economy. And what he, what he said was that, OK, you've got this mining boom going on, got all this resources, development, coal, natural gas, oil. What this was doing was was pushing up the exchange rate. OK, it was producing cheaper imports. OK, people could, could buy the goods coming into the country because the Australian dollar was valued very highly, um, and. He argued, well, this is a good thing on the one hand, because, you know, we've got a a a a a sort of emerging we've got an oil crisis in the I said there's not enough oil to go around, there's a resources crisis. We need access to cheap energy, he's saying that's good. Helps Australia. It sort of is a buffer against this international downturn caused by inflation, by shortages of oil and all the rest of it. But the problem with this, he said, Is that it places pressure I I should say on agriculture and manufacturing, so it would draw labour, for instance, away from agriculture and manufacturing into mining, but it also makes those industries less competitive. It makes them less competitive. OK, it means that it's harder to export agricultural produce, wheat and wool, um, at a price that makes it competitive on, uh, the international market. OK, if you've got large numbers of imports coming into the country, that places pressure on domestic industry. OK, so it, it provides a problem for local manufacturing called the Gregory effect after Bob Gregory, the economist. The Clary O'Shea strike was one of the key moments in, if you like, the sort of emergence of greater industrial militancy in 1969. The Arbitration Act, Australia's arbitration system that set wages and conditions centrally. The Federal Act had penal provisions in it, so if a if a union went out on strike illegally, Uh, union leaders could be imprisoned, uh, unions could be fined. Um, what happens, and this was a, a, a dispute in the tramways industry, you can see there the tramies union, is that O'Shea, uh, who was a tramway union leader, went to jail. OK, he basically, uh, the union refused to pay fines under these penal provisions, and he was in prison, and this became a real core celebre. OK, huge sort of um. Moments if you like, that that essentially did away with the penal provisions of the arbitration Act, and it opened the way for greater freedom for unions to defy industrial awards if they felt they were unreasonable. OK, so you can see that that story I was telling earlier. Declining labour discipline is reflected in certainly the Clary O'Shea strike, but it, you know, there was a general sense, I think, within the community that union leaders shouldn't go to jail over industrial disputes in that sort of way. So it, it sort of, um, I guess, exposed the system and the vulnerabilities and frailties of the system to um public controversy and debate. And then the coming of the Whitlam government is an important moment, 7275, there's Whitlam with um his treasurer Frank Crane. It's very important, the broad picture if you like, of the Whitlam government is that it's um programme of spending, which was substantial, had been formulated during the long boom. It was very much designed for a long boom period with high levels of growth. By the time Whitlam comes in at the end of 1972, The long boom is coming to an end for all of the reasons and in all of the ways that I've been talking about. So you can see there's some aspects of the Whitlam government, expanded welfare state and social security, so really major increases in social security payments as well as the institution of some new types of payments such as the supporting mothers benefit, high wages, as I've already talked about, a deliberate policy of stimulating wage growth, equal pay for men and women, as I've talked about, one of the first things the government, uh, um, uh, pursues at the end of 1972. Expanded educational provision, so, um, abolition of fees in universities, um, Medibank and a national health insurance policy, Um, quite ambitious plans for regional and urban development, such as the development of Albury Wodonga, controls on foreign ownership of Australian resources, and also state enterprise in the resources industry, a role for government in effectively developing resources. All of this is ambitious and expensive. It's ambitious and expensive, and it's a vulnerable programme in the context of an economy that's starting to close down. OK, an economy that is not growing at its old rate. So there you have the problems that the government faces a declining international and domestic economy. Inflation is becoming a problem, a serious problem by 1973, how does the government attempt to deal with it? Well, it does something very dramatic. It very suddenly and drastically cut tariffs across the board by 25% as an anti-inflationary measure. OK, the idea being that that would allow more goods to come into the country from overseas, makes imports cheaper, and uh the the, you know, oops, and that's that's a dampener on inflation if you've got more goods in the country that are cheaper. The problem of course is that it also places pressure on domestic industry. If you've got imports flooding into the country, local manufacturing is less able to compete. And that can create unemployment. As it happened, it probably didn't to any great degree, but in the short term, but that was one of the government's measures to deal with inflation. Second one, they introduced a prices justification tribunal, which was really more about exposure and moral suasion about prices rather than a body with teeth, um. And there's a credit squeeze, the government reduces money supply, there's increasing interest rates, OK, so this is all about dealing with the problem of inflation, but government spending, Increases and um continues and and a critical moment there was the 1974, 1975 budget, when a lot of the kind of macroeconomic indicators, seemed to suggest the government need to moderate its spending, but, If you like the, the, the, uh, you know, the sort of moderates like Crean, who I just so there he is, who wanted to moderate spending, um, was simply overwhelmed by other elements within the government, and you have an expansionary budget in 19745, which in many ways was absolutely fatal, because it, it, it essentially worsened a number of the economic indicators um such as unemployment. The government tries currency devaluation as a way of of um stemming imports, um, stimulating exports, supporting local industry, but unemployment is increasing. It also cuts immigration levels, the classic response to bad economic times. So the the government faces an unusual set of problems that had not really been faced by any government during the period of the long boom, um, but it also has ambitions around, you know, control of Australian resources and particularly in the context of the oil crisis, you know, this global resources crisis, it's inflationary and you have government ministers, and you've got Jim Cairns on the left, Rex, who's um uh deputy prime minister eventually. Um, and in the middle, Rex Connor, the Minister for Minerals and Energy with them over on the right, basically they, they, they want greater control of Australian resources. They want the government to play a stronger role in developing Australian resources to insulate Australia from these global economic pressures and crises. And that's really the origin of the scandal that would eventually play the major part in bringing down this government. So, um, I told you about the 1974 budget. And uh the the economy gets worse, essentially in the wake of that, as, as you might expect, um. Jim Cairns, who I showed you a moment ago, was briefly treasurer, but never delivered a budget. Uh, he went down in a scandal whose outline I'll describe in a moment. He's replaced by Bill Hayden, one of the youngest members of cabinet, and Hayden produces a budget in 1975 that um is deflationary, that is, it, it's a um a um it it moderates the increases in government spending. He talks about the importance now of fighting inflation. OK, not simply dealing with unemployment, but fighting inflation. And it was widely received as a good budget. It was seen as a budget that was well calibrated for the problems that the government faced economically, but as those of you who do political history or know anything in political history, uh, it, it was blocked, not for economic reasons, it was blocked for political reasons. OK, the, uh, in the Senate, where um the opposition uh was in a position, had the numbers to be able to block it, and it used as a um a reason or pretext for doing that, the loans affair. Now the loans Affair, I'm not going to go into in great detail here, uh, in outline it it involved those two ministers on the left, Cairns and Connor, and the key dimension of it was Rex Connor in the middle, the guy in the middle. His plans to build, um, well, to use billions of dollars for developing Australia's resources, you know, gas pipelines and a whole range of quite ambitious infrastructure and other projects. However, the loan raising methods were very unorthodox. He tried to get what we call petrodollars. These were the essentially funds that had been generated by that OPEC, um, increase in oil prices. So, you know, that had brought in vast amounts of money to Middle Eastern countries. They had cash sloshing around. The idea was, oh, we can get cheap cash from the Middle East. And they used a dodgy intermediary, a guy called Tira Kimlani. And they end up in a great big mess because Connor continues to pursue, uh, the loan after um official authorization to pursue the loan had been withdrawn, and he lied about it. OK, and eventually this develops into a major scandal that the opposition uses a pretext for blocking supply, blocking the 1975 budget, and, uh, as many of you will know, in the end the Governor General intervened to dismiss the Whitlam government. But for our purposes, economic history purposes here, what's critical in this, Is that this was about energy. It was about the government's continuing economic ambitions, particularly in the energy sector that's really at the heart of the fall of the government, OK, so there were economic issues there and of course the broader downturn in the economy undermined confidence in the government in its capacity to manage the economy effectively. And so you're coming out of that, you have this phenomenon of stagflation, which I've already mentioned, low growth, inflation, rising unemployment, and the end of that kind of Keynesian ascendancy, this idea that you could somehow, you know, if the economy was going a bit down, you governments would, would go and they'd increase spending and that would sort of smooth things out, it would increase demand in the economy and things would come into balance. That combination of low growth, inflation, unemployment meant that those Keynesian interventionist methods were no longer working. And so you have the rise of alternative um uh forms of, of economic management, often from the political right, monetarism, the idea that by adjusting the level of monetary supply, you would be able to essentially control the economy, bring it back into into balance. There was an emphasis now on fighting inflation first, that is that the most important problem in the economy was inflation, if you got that right. Everything else would fall into place. The problem, of course, is what's the short-term cost of aggressively fighting inflation. Yeah. What happens? Unemployment, we, we saw fears of that, didn't we just recently, it didn't quite happen, interestingly, OK, but that that that was essentially the cost. If you fight inflation aggressively, rising unemployment. So the use of unemployment as a weapon to be deployed in doing it. And I'm, I'm just gonna end on this note with the Fraser government, we're just about out of time, um, which came to office, initially as a result of the dismissal, won a big election in December 1975. And what's interesting about this, and I won't go into all this in detail, is it. For the most part, pursues rather similar kinds of economic policies to those that had been presaged by the 1975 budget. In fact, kept the 1975 budget, it didn't introduce a new one. It kept basically the Hayden budget. But there's a growing emphasis on fighting inflation and and certainly the government does manage to get inflation to reasonable levels, but it's never able to get it under control in the context of a less stable global economy of the 1970s, particularly the energy crisis, which is incredibly inflationary. So you know, it's kind of set up, set out there some aspects of the Fraser government. There is no return here to the conditions of the long boom. It's essentially now dealing with a different kind of economic order that's not amenable to the kinds of tools that Menzies, for instance, and the public service and Holt had been able to use back in 1961, 1962 to bring the economy back into into balance. And so look, I won't go further today, we can come back to that actually as a background to the, the Hawke um and the 1980s period, uh, in our next lecture. So thank you. That's
