SPEAKER 1
Uh, everyone got one? Right, let's do this Mhm What I It's not very good, is it? It's now too low. anyway, can you see it? You can sort of see that, can't you? I wonder. That's You'll do. Righto, I think we can start, so I begin by acknowledging traditional owners of the land on which we meet the Nuna and Nambu and pay my respects to elders, people and country. Now, um, you have in front of you a document that I've actually had more or less on. And I also From the format. Ian. So You know, you hopefully uh you know, you can use it as a practise exam. There are other, I think there's another sort of old exam exposed on Waddle as well, which you can use for practise questions. Um, that's basically what it'll look like, so you have 6 options in the first bit, from which you'll need to choose 2 as short answer questions. Uh, you'll have, um, uh, two lots of three options, uh, underneath that, from which you'll need to choose, uh, uh, two essays, one in each section. Please don't do 2 essays in one section, OK? And B and C, one from each. Uh, they're designed in a way to, I guess, test your, the breadth of your knowledge, so you need to, to, um, aim at all three sections of the paper. Yeah. Uh Now look, it's 3.5, you've got half an hour briefing time, and you've got 3 hours. Now, that's meant to. Um How shall I put it, relieve you. To calm you, rather than to panic you, in other words, You're getting more time in the hope that, you know, if there is a false move or you make an error or go down a pathway in the exam, it's a bit of a, a mistake, that there'll be time for you to correct that. OK, so you, I've given you 3 hours, not because I necessarily expect you to write furiously for 3 hours and fill out, you know, 3 exam booklets, but to, to give you the time to think. To reflect, I'm not expecting, you know, um, essays that go page after page after page. I mean there's no word count given for sort of, uh, closed book type exams. I use, I've given them when we've had take home exams in the past, and if I can tell you, actually, I think I had, I don't know, what was it, 400 words for a short answer question. I think I said 1000 words for a long like for an essay. Now that's not a bad rule of thumb, you might do a bit more than that, I don't know, um, in, in a, a closed book exam, um, but, you know, it, it's, it's quality rather than quantity and. Um, I'll be asking the examiner, I mean, I'm the examiner of course, but you know, we'll be sort of playing a role in terms of moderation rather than ploughing through all of your exams. What I'll be telling them is that the rule of thumb I always use is, is to ask a single question about, uh, each exam paper, what is the quality, what is the quality, not quantity, what is the quality of this student's understanding? That's the ultimate test. Now, that doesn't mean that you have to get every detail right. OK, and it doesn't mean you're gonna be punished mercilessly for forgetting, you know, this or that factual error. OK, that's, that's not, it's the overall quality of your understanding that we're looking for. Now, obviously, if you fill an exam paper with stuff that's kind of made up or so far, uh so inaccurate that it bears no resemblance to Australian economic history, we have a problem. OK, because that would reflect on the quality of your understanding. OK, but we're not, it's not, um, a matter of trying to trip you up with, you know, little errors and missteps, that's not what we're about here. What is the overall quality of this student's understanding? OK, and, and that means you don't have to, you know, piles and piles of material. It, it, it may well mean disclosing to the examiner, a really firm grasp of of three key issues in relation to a particular question. OK. So I hope that'll reassure you, um, the time is there to help you, not to intimidate you. OK, I could easily, in fact, I think I used to have this as with much the same content as a 2 hour exam with probably 15 minutes reading time. I think it, it. I'll let you theorise about this. I think it may have blown out to 3 hours when Nicholas was, um, was, was, uh, convening the course. I think it went from 2 to 3, if I remember correctly. I don't think it was 3 a few years ago, but it is 3 now, and what that does, it gives you the time to really sit and, and think. I mean, use your 3 hours, there's no point in. You know, leaving the exam room early, I think you're still allowed to do that, aren't you? You can go early if you want, but, you know, unless you're really confident, I wouldn't do that, you might as well use the time you've got, um, but, but yeah, don't, don't panic about it being 3 hours, don't feel as though that means all the examiners are gonna be expecting vast amounts of material. That's not the purpose behind the 3 hours. OK? Any questions about the sort of format, details or yeah.

SPEAKER 2
OK I don't know.

SPEAKER 1
I don't know. I'll have to I'll have to follow that up for you, um. I'll have to follow that up. I, I think not, I think you can only pick up. I'll have to, I'll check it out. I'll check it out. So I don't think I was asked that question in setting the conditions, so I'll need to check it, it may be a uniform condition or practise within CBE which I'll need to check up, OK. Uh I'll get, I'll get you in a moment. OK, good. I'll, I'll check that up and put the answer on wattle. Yeah. Oh, so it'll it'll be marked essentially by your, your tutors, not necessarily your tutor, but the tutors of, of which there of whom there are 3 in, in the course, and, uh, I'll play a role in, uh, you know, kind of moderating process, uh, as, as chief examiner. I think Nick is actually sort of deputy examiner, um, but yeah, that, that's basically how it's how it's done. So it won't necessarily be probably unlikely to be. Your uh actual tutor, um, might be, but um uh it it will be essentially the tutors in in the course who do that work, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 3
Um, it seems to me that section A, B, and C in this example is like sort of divided between, you know, early and then 1800s, 1800s. Yeah, so there, there is not, not the short answer,

SPEAKER 1
short answers don't do any, any principle of that kind, uh, I mean they'll they'll cover various aspects of the of the course, uh, yeah, look, B and C, um, there is an attempt to, to kind of, uh, ensure a bit of coverage in terms of period, yeah, so. Uh, probably not, yes, in fact, it probably will force you to, um, be dealing with both, uh, a sort of more distant past and the more recent past. I think that's probably the best principle I can, I can lay down for that, yeah. And it is quite deliberate because obviously your second the, the research essay you've done recently, which will go back to your, you'll get the marks, uh, tomorrow, um, Don't cover the last part of the course, so I think it's important that the exam does, frankly, and, and ask you to to reflect on that, yeah. Yeah, any, any other, yes, yeah, sure, over here, was there someone else as well? Sorry, yeah, OK. So So like it would ask This Just like this, I wrote this one, I think this is 20. 23, which means I wrote it, um, and, and this is, this is the format. So, yeah, treat, treat this one, which is just the one that was there, but it was, it was down for when it was a take home exam, so I've just fixed it now so that it, you know, is, is kind of the format. In fact, I've, I've copied and pasted what I sent the um office a couple of weeks ago, um, that, that is kind of the, the, the format that it will be and the style of question now. The, the question the tutorial questions for each week are a really good guide, frankly. I mean, they, they are a good, a good guide to the kinds of things you should be preparing, OK? I mean, they're there for a reason that they kind of cover the key, the key issues. So, you know, they, in, in your preparation, and, you know, hopefully you've been grappling with those each week in preparation for tutorials, they're a really good guide, I think, to, to what you should be preparing as you, um. Uh, you know, head towards the, uh, the exam. You've got a fair bit of time, they stuck it quite late-ish, didn't they, in the exam period, so you do have a bit of time to do this. I'll be around. I mean, occasionally go into state, but I'll, I'll be around. So if you've got any queries, of course, between now and the exam, I'm, I'm not going into hiding, uh, after Friday. I'm still on the job, um, so yeah, just, just get in touch if you've got any particular queries as you you prepare. Anything else? Yes.

SPEAKER 4
So Oh, there's no, so there's no expectation of obviously

SPEAKER 1
referencing in a, in an exam like this, a quoting, well, uh, if you've got a good memory, I suppose you can quote directly from a source that you've, you've read, um, but it's a closed books, so there's no expectation of, of quoting, um, directly. I mean, if you can remember something, by all means go ahead. But no, I mean it's, it's uh more a process of synthesis, I think, um, if, if, if there is a particular argument that you know can be a tribute, I mean, good example. The, the role of, of, uh, um, you know, public capital formation and and and uh building and construction, uh, in the colonial economy is a driver of growth in the colonial economy. OK, well, you know, hopefully you might know that that is an argument that's particularly associated with Noel Butlin, right? And I've got you to read something of that earlier in the course, it's a particular and yeah, perfectly fine to, to attribute that to, to, to Butlin in in an exam and, and, uh, paraphrase. summarise the nature of the argument, and an examiner will be impressed by that, that you're showing an awareness of the debates of the specificities of the debates in a, in a particular, on a particular topic, and that's great. Um, and, and applies to all of the, the readings you've you've done. But of course, it's, it's your thoughts, your arguments that we're after. But in getting there, of course, you may well cite, um, or refer to the different kinds of, uh, arguments that have been put about whatever issue it is, really. Yeah. And, and, you know, it's perfectly acceptable to um to refer to a particular lecture or something like that too if you want. There's no prohibition on that, particularly in the exam, I think, I think it's perfectly reasonable, it shows you've engaged with the course. Good, good stuff.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 3
So So These ones are samples, so they're not the

SPEAKER 1
real ones, they're not the ones that you'll have in

SPEAKER 3
front of you on the day, but they, they give

SPEAKER 1
you an indication of the kind of questions you'd like to forget. I mean, for all I know, there could be a repetition. I don't know, I'm not a very original person. There could be for all I know, but no, they, they give you an exact the style of question. It'd be a good thing to practise on. It'd give you a good, a good thing to practise on. Yeah. OK. So it's not the actual one, as I put there, practise. OK, practise examination, not the real thing, but that's what it's gonna look like, basically, except not more nicely formatted. Anything else. Feel free, any, any other questions? OK, if anything occurs to you, go for it. What I'm going to do here, there we go, is just give you an overview, OK? Here's an overview. Here's some of the things that you might want to consider as you're preparing, as you're thinking about the big themes in the course, um, helping to structure your thoughts and understandings. Um, but yeah, again, uh, hopefully many of these will echo the kinds of questions that are set weekly for your, your tutorials. Now, one of the, the myths. that you can use when you're answering any number of questions, OK, any, any, you know, variety of questions here would be comparative method and and McLean does this. OK, it's not McLean's is a study of the Australian economy, obviously. He keeps the Australian economy pretty squarely, sharply in focus, but you'll notice that he has judicious selective comparison. At various points, OK, it's not a it's not a systematic comparison of the Australian economy to some other economy through or some other economy is through the book, but you'll notice that there are recurring comparisons depending on what he's talking about. OK, you can do that too. You can do that too. OK, it can be a really good way of making an argument about Australia. OK, and here are, you know, a few examples that you could, you could talk about, so. You know, you might compare, if you're thinking about living standards, you might compare Australia and the United States as, as um McLean does for the 19th century, for instance. Uh, the United Kingdom is, is often a point of comparison, I guess, because of, uh, settler Australia's derivation, um, uh, but in some ways, I, I, I find it a less helpful comparison for a lot of reasons, it, it was, you know, obviously a grand imperial economy. Um, with a, a very dominant role in, uh, the global system, uh, Australia was a part of that world, so comparison perhaps is less relevant in the case of the United Kingdom than context, the fact that the Australian economy develops within a British imperial system really until the end of the 1950s, you could argue, OK, and, and hopefully you can uh recall, you can think back to a number of ways in which that helps us to understand. The Australian economy. OK, so think of, for instance, take one example, Australia's place as a trading economy, it's, you know, it's it's um exports of wool and gold within the British system. OK, much of that trade was done with the United Kingdom. OK, and that was true up and we'll talk more about this in a moment, up until, uh, uh, the beginning of the 1960s. Um, comparisons with Canada as a resource-based industrialization. Also in a a commodity trap, so, um. It it is striking that, uh, um, you know, Canada is a more industrialised country than Australia, and it's worth thinking about why and how that came about. Was it geographical location, for instance? You know, Canada's greater proximity to big markets across the border in the United States, indeed closer proximity to, to Europe, for instance. OK. And remember of course that Canada was also the case study if you like, for the original articulation and development of staple theory, OK, um. Uh, Harold Innes, uh, initially focusing on the fur trade. OK, so, you know, um, the role that commodities play within an economy, OK, the ways in which becoming, uh, um, sort of dependent, if you like, on, on the export of a particular eco um commodity can become a kind of trap. For that economy, it can become a a um a a cap if you like, on it's on its wider diversification, development, growth and efficiencies, um, New Zealand, um, we don't talk much about in, in the course, but, um, uh, you know, it's worth thinking there. I mean New Zealand living standards, uh, were probably comparable with Australia's during much of the, the 20th century up till. I guess the 1970s, but are actually lower now, so real incomes are are significantly lower in in New Zealand today than in Australia. I wonder if mineral resource endowments might help account for that, and there's some some discussion of that in, in McLean towards the end of that book. Argentina, which I'll talk about more in a moment, because that's been a very, a long standing point of comparison with the Australian economy for a range of reasons, really to do with their similarity. I mean comparative method can sometimes be about different cases, cases that are contrasting. But also about like cases and and and that can be a very useful way of thinking about um uh you know how economies develop um so comparative history can be a really interesting um and useful method for exploring causation. OK, so what are the. The drive we want if we want to understand Australia's relatively high, settler Australia's relatively high living standards for much of the last couple of 100 years, by placing Australia in a comparative context, we can often get a sense of what the causes of that might have been. I'll do that now with Argentina. Now this has been uh a a long standing fascination of, uh, historians, economic historians, when I say long standing, I think, Um, you know, it probably doesn't go back more than about half a century, but there's been a lot of comparison between the Australian and Argentinian economies, sometimes with an ideological bent, so, Um, a couple of rather right wing characters, I remember wrote a book, published a book about 1984, Australia and Argentina on parallel paths, and you can probably guess that one of the things they were arguing is that, um, you know, the Australian economy needed to deregulate and. Have lower wages and all the rest of it so that we didn't end up, uh, like Argentina with a sort of disintegrating economy as it had by the 1980s as well as a polity of course that had degenerated into authoritarianism. So um it it can have an ideological aspect, but in fact there is a respectable tradition of comparison between Australia and Argentina that isn't particularly ideologically disposed, uh that is is in fact about um trying to understand. And, and, and you'll find quite a lot of comparison with Argentina in in McLean's book. So why does this happen? Well, it is partly about the similarities. Um, they both, um, you know, settler society in Argentina, settler society in Australia both have high living standards up to the early decades of the 20th century. So relatively comparable living standards. They're both highly dependent on British capital and markets. OK, um, now this is uh very interesting, of course, because Australia was was formally, in formal terms, a part of the British Empire, and Argentina wasn't. But Argentina was very much a part of Britain's financial and commercial empire, even though it was not a part of its formal empire. Um, so dependence on British capital markets, um, remember the great, um, there's my phone going off, let's get rid of that, um. Um, so, um, yes, yes. So, uh, uh, yes, I was about to say that, remember, the depression of the 1890s, um, is, is in many ways, uh, provoked by a financial panic about lending to Argentina, bearings banks lending in, in Argentina, which I think emphasises the, the financial relationship between British capital markets and, uh, you know, City of London, as it was called, and is still called, and, and, and, and Argentina. Um, a rural economic base, as well as commodity exports, so beef was relatively more important to the Argentinian economy, wool to Australia's, but Argentina also had a wool industry. Many of those, Australians, people know, have I mentioned, I don't think I've mentioned new Australia in this course, have I? People know about new Australia, so are you. So, in 1893, a bunch of socialists in Australia decided the game was up here and so they all got in a ship. And went to Paraguay to create a new Australia in South America. I know, I know they did, um, and it sort of stumbled over, I mean, it, it immediately kind of split into two colonies, you know, when they, Disagreed, um, but anyway, it sort of limped on during the 1890s and eventually some of the Australians over there sort of went to Argentina and became shearers because they'd been shearers in Australia. So you know, um, Argentina also had a, had a wool industry, um, do Australian political history with me next year and uh you can learn more about new Australia in Paraguay. Um, OK, so rural economic base, limited industrialization, so both have industrialization, but on a relatively limited scale, um, and then there are the differences, and you know, the differences can be, uh, uh, particularly revealing of why why divergent paths have have occurred, particularly in the 20th century. So political and institutional differences. Australia has a relatively stable parliamentary democracy from about 1860 onwards, and as McLean points out, it pursues a measure, Of, you know, the sharing of wealth and income, um, that, you know, there are a number of, of public policies, if you like, in the 19th century that ensure that, uh, economic opportunity is relatively spread among the settler population. So good examples were, you know, limiting the size of gold claims of a claim that you could. You could peg out in order to dig for gold, you know, in theory, you could have had big companies coming in right from the beginning and claiming acres and acres and acres of gold fields for themselves. If the state, if government had been willing to tolerate that and to promote it through its policy, but it didn't, as you know, it had very limited that meant that. Opportunities to dig for gold were relatively spread out. Think also of um uh land reform, the selection movement from about 1860 onwards, OK, the, the, uh, bust up, the breakup of the large pastoral estates that occurs in the 1860s, 170s, 1980s through selection and then through various closer settlement schemes and soldier settlement and all the rest of it, OK, which spreads economic opportunity. Without spreading it too far, and this is of course McLean's particular argument, that if it spreads so far, if it had spread so far that it embeds um massive economic inefficiencies that you end up with unviable farming, for instance, well then you've got a problem, then it can have a very negative effect on economic growth. But McLean's point is that somehow, somehow, and we kind of need political explanation for this, somehow, Uh, there, there is a, a kind of a wealth redistribution, but it also has its limits. OK, and the family farm sort of emerges out of that, that balance between land monopoly, if you like, and, you know, a sort of indefinite spread of, of, uh, smaller states. You get, you get end up with a kind of happy medium that's partly driven, of course, by, Um, things like climate and the quality of land. So sometimes you did get farmers who would set up on, on blocks of land that were too small, with government assistance, they would fail, and the result of that would be land would be. Going quite cheaply to neighbouring farmers who are more successful were able to amalgamate farms and create bigger estates, OK, which are often more efficient and which would reach a threshold that allowed them to engage successfully in commercial farming. OK, and yeah, it's obviously a complex literature that explores how this has has happened, but anyway, those political institutional differences um between Australia and Argentina are quite significant, um, membership of the British Empire being an English speaking country might have made borrowing in London cheaper as well. Um, but you know, look at those policy differences, you have Australian land reform, but Argentina had a greater concentration of wealth and power with more secure large landowners. OK, and you had a, a, a, a rather poor and mobile tenant farming class who had very little control over land, who were not able to institutionalise. And establish that family farm, that commercial family farm that was quite important in the Australian settler context. OK, so those sorts of differences can be important, some political and institutional, um, others sometimes arising from those political and institutional factors um uh relating to to policy. Um, and I suppose the Australia Argentina debate feeds into a larger set of debates about economic performance, and you'll recall this is where we began the course. If you remember some of the stuff I was saying in the first week, it was, I was making the point, I, I, I wanted you to, to, to be able to challenge this kind of sort of rather, um, celebratory, uh, narrative, not entirely celebratory, I suppose, about Australia's economic performance in the long run. And it basically goes, I'm dealing with settler Australia. You, you have um 19th century success when Australia concentrates on its comparative advantage as a resource rich trader, so this is the idea, look, Australia's, You know, um, strength, Australia's strength is its resource endowment. OK, the fact that it has large amounts of, um, you know, land, admittedly of uneven quality, but which could be made productive and which could be, uh, if you like, uh, inserted into a, a, a commercial world. OK, and this is obviously based on dispossession of indigenous people, something that, Been, I think, much more recognised in the economic histories of more recent times, but less so uh in earlier, uh, narratives. But basically this idea that Australia, uh, you know, Australia's advantage was uh as a, as a trader. Um, Australia declines economically in the 20th century because it moves away from those areas where it had comparative advantage, like pastoralism, like exporting wool into manufacturing. Into more state regulation and protection, the arbitration system which protects wages and conditions, tariff protection, which sets up a kind of a wall behind which manufacturers, often less efficient than potential competitors were able to function. OK, so the argument here goes, you know, it's the arguments in some ways that are being used against Trump and his tariffs today. That Australia took a kind of wrong path in the 20th century, from about the 1890s onwards, when it went down this path of trying to promote manufacturing with the protection and assistance of state interventions, of government interventions. OK. So it's a narrative of decline, right? And then this it becomes celebratory again because it says, and then from the 1980s with the dismantling of this kind of regime of state intervention. And the renewed emphasis on resources, this time mining rather than pastoralism, the economy becomes a great success, a miracle economy of the late 20th century and the early 21st century. Well let me ask you, what's wrong with that? You've had 12 weeks now to think about it. I think it's, it's problematic from the point of view of a contextualised historical account. Why do you think I think it's right? Now you may think it's perfectly OK, and we will have differences of, of, of uh opinion over this. It's not entirely wrong. In fact, being able to to answer a question on something like this in the exam, uh, requires you to be able to, to, to sort of grapple with what aspects of it are right. OK, so it's not entirely wrong, but why do you think, I reckon it's, it's if you like a simplistic. So what we see I'll come, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
The system was much more stable in both of the 19th.

SPEAKER 1
That's a part of it, isn't it? The capital markets, um, uh, you know, we, we know that the global system, and not just the financial system, but we could add to that the trading, the global trading system is enormously disrupted, for instance, by the First World War. So outbreak of war in 1914 does provoke a financial crisis that runs right through the inter-war years. Uh, you know, Britain goes off the gold standard, for instance, in 1914, it goes back on it, 1925. And then back off it again in the early 1930s, OK, so, uh, financial instability, but also, you know, the use of, of, of the tariff of retaliatory tariffs right through this period, which of course destabilise and, and, and, uh, hinder global, global trade. So it's about finance and capital, it's about trade, um, yeah.

SPEAKER 4
I pretty much the same thing about like that particular period required intervention. And the like the saying that Australia declines as a result of state regulation, kind of feels like you need to explain the possibilities of. Hm. In a, in a depression into um. I mean, particularly if you look at the um. Regulation for like the post. Rebuild and stuff. You Explore how Australia might look without.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, it's a really good point because, um, uh, one of the techniques that historians use, I've talked about comparative technique, and another, of course, is, is the counterfactual. And the counterfactual what if, in other words, a what if question, which is what you're posing there, and a, a, a what if question does ask, well, what if? I mean, what were the alternatives to the particular course, the particular pathways that that Australia took in the 20th century, um. And they were pretty limited, I would have thought, and and especially when you consider that, you know, this is a country that that wanted a a higher population, OK, believed that both prosperity and security demanded. That the vast open spaces be filled, that a population of 5 or 6 million um uh was not going to be satisfactory, um, and of course this is a very racialized argument too, isn't it? It's an argument about white Australia in a, in a, a world, you know, a region that's that's mainly not white, um, but that starts to bring in values, doesn't it? It starts to bring, well, what are they trying to achieve, what are they trying to achieve? And modernity in the middle decades of the 20th century demanded industrialization. Security was seen to demand industrialization and so governments are looking, how can they promote industrialization, OK, um, the, the idea that there were some moments, some fork in the road, if you like, where the Australian Australian decision makers, where we're talking about companies or bus or um or or government could have said, oh look, let's just um, Let's forget about this industrialization thing. We've got comparative advantage. Look at all that wheat and wool. OK, so let, let's forget about making cars. Who wants to make cars? I mean, it's absurd. OK, from a historical point of view, this is completely absurd. It, it utterly, it's, it's uh an account that's utterly devoid of any sense of context, right? And yet, And yet you'll find some types of economists will reason along. It was a mistake, Australia should never have had a car industry, they'll say. OK, now, yeah, OK, alright, from the point of view of certain economic theories, you could argue that. If you really take that idea of comparative advantage seriously, you could argue that, but that's not the world that's inhabited by real actors, OK, and it's certainly not the one inhabited by politicians who are accountable for their decision making. OK, and, and we know, I mean one of the things I tried to emphasise when we got to World War 2 is how well equipped this rather ramshackle industrial economy was, in many respects, rather ramshackle, but how well equipped it was to defend itself. OK, and, and that was because, you know, you had both a highly developed agricultural and industrial economy by the time we get to 1939, so it's able to feed Americans. In the Second World War, it's able to feed that all those GI's and all the rest of it, but it's also able to make weapons, OK, some of which are actually OK. You can even make aircraft, extraordinary. OK, so the argument here, it's not really one about values so much, it's about technique and methodology, it's about how can we understand the past, it's about how to do economic history. The reason I've always, well, yes, since I think virtually always now I had McLean as the text for this course, he's got I think he does that. OK, he doesn't say, oh, you know, Australia should have simply relied on its mineral endowments earlier than we would have been richer and had a more efficient economy. Well, yeah, terrific, but you've got to actually be confident that you have those mineral endowments to begin with, and as David Lee told us, if you remember, when he was talking about the uh the mining boom, uh from the other venue. Australia wasn't even aware of what its iron ore reserves were until the 1950s. It thought they were limited. OK, and government prohibited exports between the late 1930s and the beginning of the 1960s as a result. OK, when it became clearer that uh that there were more substantial reserves of iron ore as a result of of exploration during the 1950s, pressure comes on. In this case, it often it came on from mining companies and state government, particularly Western Australian government, pressure on the Menzies government, the ban is lifted at the beginning in in stages really in the early 1960s and gradually you get this mining boom, um, it takes off, that's really never ended during the 1960s, um, and of course that opens up new other other alternative, you know, new possibilities for the economy. So when we think about those fabled reforms, Of the 1980s, these famous reforms of the 1980s, would they have even been politically feasible in the absence of the development of the mineral sector during the 1960s and 1970s? Would they even have been feas and there's a what if for you. Would they have even been feasible? OK, would it have been acceptable for a government to basically come along in the 1980s and say, oh look, You know, I think what we can do is we're gonna we're gonna wind back tariffs now, and yeah, sure, it's gonna be deindustrializing and. You know, there's going to be fewer people working in factories, but look, That's alright, we can bear 20% unemployment. No problem. We'll just pay you the dole. No, no government could do this, but of course with the, the, the, the, you know, a differently structured economy by the time you get to the 1960s and 1970s, um, a, a more complex export economy than it existed earlier, new possibilities open for public policy. OK? So. Um, let's move on. I'm not going to get through all these slides today, it doesn't matter. They're there for you to have a look at online, so I'll just go through a few more. Um, these are some of the themes, the, the, the overview themes of the, of the course. So, one thing that I think you should have planted in your mind as you go into the exam is the changing pattern of our exports, in terms of geography, for instance. Remember the point I made very early in the course about, Um, the, uh, rising significance of Australia's trade with Asia and the Pacific in the very early period, the beginning of trade with Calcutta, for instance, in the 1790s. OK, that this is, there was a kind of regional trading order that was emerging in the shadow of the British East India Company, which had a, uh, a de facto, or a, or I should say a de jure, a formal monopoly, but which, um, various traders were able to successfully challenge in that early period. Then, as Australia develops uh it's staples, um, you know, in some ways the connections, the regional connections weaken, OK, and Australia's key trading relationship in a way is not so much with empire, but with Britain itself. OK, and so those connections with with Britain, based on staples, uh, whale oil, but particularly uh wool. Uh, become very important, Australia's wool industry is fundamentally a part of an imperial economy, but, you know, imperial, uh, understood as Australia and Britain. Japan, um sort of sits there of rising importance in the 20s and 30s, but only within still within a broad uh uh relationship of Australia to Britain. Uh, uh, but then of much greater importance from the 1950s onwards, uh, China overtook Japan as Australia's, uh, major, um, destination for exports in 2008. OK, so decades of, of Japanese significance from the 50s through to, um, well, to the present, it remains very uh important. Japan became Australia's primary um export market in 1967. OK, so it gives you a sense of the, the periodization there. So between 1967. And 2008, long period, Japan is Australia's primary export market's utterly bound up with um the um uh the the uh mining boom. The Mineral sector, but also Japan's great success as an exporter of manufactured goods, and especially electronic manufactured goods which Australians love, they want them. Um, so Japan and China, the rising importance of China, the beginnings of trade with China, not beginnings in general, but the, the, the sort of modern beginnings of trade with China, mainly in wheat from the late 50s and then of course the importance of minerals in our present century. Um, also within that broad sort of um picture there, um, the concept of a Northeast Asian ascendancy, which was developed by bureaucrats and governments in the late 1980s, um, the key document's called the Garnaut report, actually the, The official title of it was the Northeast Asian Ascendant. It's 1989, and uh you know, it comprised those countries there, Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan, pointing to collectively their enormous importance to the Australian economy, and part of what Garnaut was doing here of course was advocating lower and lower tariffs. He's basically arguing Australia can take advantage of this dynamic growth area in our region, but it can only do so if it's willing to drop the tariffs. OK, so that it can integrate its economy more successfully. Uh, unfortunately for for Garnaut, the, um, Beijing massacre occurred, I think shortly before he was going to print is my general impression. There's kind of all these traces in the the document of uncertainty about what will happen with respect to Australia's relationship with China in that context. But as we know, it really did go from strength to strength, uh, subsequently, and was not greatly affected by that particular uh moment. And I've I've been briefly mentioned, uh, New Zealand too, which, uh, you know, it's been a very important, um, uh, trading partner for Australia over the long period, um, uh, despite the fact, of course, that in, in many ways, each of them had kind of, um, sort of, uh, bilateral trade relations with with Great Britain based on commodity exports, but there's, there's also, Of course, uh, developing relations between them, culminating in CER closer economic relations, uh, which was signed in 1983, OK, to, to facilitate easy exchange of um products between the two countries. labour, people often think that that's when also the, the people movement thing became free, but that was earlier. OK, that, that was back in the 70s, so the, the, um. You know, the right of New Zealanders to work in Australia, the right of of Australians to work in New Zealand without visas and so on. OK, um, the nature and significance of the export, so not just the destinations and places, but what was being exported. OK, so again, have a, get a sense of this, uh, go back to your readings, very good set of documents, a reminder here, uh, that the appendices of the Cambridge Economic History of Australia, who's used the Cambridge Economic History of Australia during the course? OK, so it's easy, just go into the the uh catalogue, as long as you're logged in, it'll let you into the volume. And at the end of the volume, there's a whole about 30, 40 pages I suppose, of economic statistics. Now not riveting reading but really useful. Go through them, make notes, what do they tell you about the changing nature of the Australian economy. They're not comprehensive. But they're really good for things like, well, you know, what was the proportion of GDP that was manufacturing by the late 1950s or whatever. OK, those sorts of questions, always allowing for what I said last time when I was talking about things like, The, you know, gendered nature of this, the statistics embody values and judgments and techniques of measuring ideology, OK, so they look very objective, but nonetheless they're useful, OK, recognising that GDP doesn't measure everything, it's an imperfect measure. OK, so the changing nature of of the exports, we've talked about whale oil in the very early period, wool overtakes it as the most valuable export about the mid 1830s. Uh, the role of gold, the most valuable export from 1950 through to, uh, sorry, 1850 I should say, through to about 1870, but again, taking up that very important point that Klain and others like Geoffrey Blainey have made, that, that gold remains an incredibly valuable export for Australia, well after the period we talk about as the gold rushes. OK, and of course there were subsequent gold rushes in Queensland in the 1870s in, in, uh, um, um, The eastern goldfields of Western Australia in the 1890s and so on. Wheat, um, the development of a commercial wheat export trade, particularly from the later 19th century, uh, with the coming of, uh, um, freezing. Uh, meat you could you could send frozen meat to Britain by the 18. 80s, 1880s, Australia has a disadvantage compared with Argentina which can send refrigerated meat because it's closer to the, the key markets. Australia, it's frozen, which means it's lower quality by the time it gets there, but it is a trade. Uh, minerals and fuel we've talked about, remember, I think David Lee pointed out, no coal exports until you get to the the 1950s. OK, no coal exports. Australia's er wasn't producing enough coal for its own needs, but then, uh, they get their act together, largely through state interventions actually. Joint coal boards established in the 1940s and greater efficiencies are embedded. New, new fields are opened up, OK, and by the 1950s you have coal exports. It overtakes wool, by the time you get to the late 1970s, what are the implications of that for the broader political economy, and we know that it has massive implications for Australia's place in a, A, uh, you know, a world uh still dependent on, on fossil fuels, OK, so, Um, Uh Yeah, the, the role of, of minerals, the, the, the role of the mining boom, as I've already talked about from the, particularly from the early 60s onwards. And consider the role of policy in that. I mean, a lot of economic history kind of assumes this all just happens. Just happens, you know, Australia has natural resource endowments or it has, uh, you know, comparative advantage and therefore it just happens. Well, it doesn't just happen. OK, state policy plays a really critical role in economic history, and we've seen that again and again in this course in all sorts of contexts, whether it's land reform of the 1860s, the selection acts, or whether it's lifting the mining embargo, the the the uh iron ore embargo. In 1960, the state interventions are often very important. OK, the promotion of the wool industry as a part of a regime of punishment for convicts in the 1820s and 1830s. That's a state decision, government decision making, OK? So, uh, we are just about out of time, um, so look, I won't go into this in great detail, you'll find, as I've said there, um, charts that will help you with this, um, but you know, questions like how open is the economy, you know, what part of the economy, what proportion of the economy. Is given over to trade, imports and exports. OK, you'll find statistics for this in the Cambridge history. So I'll leave it there, that the slides are online. You can go through them just for some guidance about some of the big themes of the course. Hopefully many of them will be familiar to you because it's really just reiterating things that have already been said, um, during the course. Um, as I said, feel free to get in touch over the next couple of weeks ahead of the exam if you've got any particular queries. Um, my advice always when you're facing exams is practise. That there was a I think a American football guy who said, Uh, prac you know, the saying, practise makes perfect, if you come across that, practise makes me, and he said this is what he said, he said, practise makes perfect is bullshit. He said, practise makes perfect is bullshit. Perfect practise makes perfect. And what that means for you, preparing is se your phones.
