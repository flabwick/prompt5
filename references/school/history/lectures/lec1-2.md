SPEAKER 1
We're there, we're there, so, um. So are you ready to go? Good. OK, great. Well, welcome everyone, um, good to see you. Yes, here we are in in our other venue. We can compare venues. Are the law venues better than arts venues, who knows? Um, OK, so look, it's great pleasure that I introduce uh Professor. Boyd Hunter, uh, Boyd is in Polis, aren't you, which is a centre for, uh, uh, social policy research, uh, in Research School of Social Sciences. Boyd, Boyd's work, of course, is on your reading list, uh, for the early part of the course, and, um, uh, we're delighted to have him talking today about the indigenous economy before colonisation. So Boyd, without further ado, thank you again for, for being. A regular contributor to this course, it's enormously appreciated, thank you.

SPEAKER 2
Thanks, Frank. Uh, I feel obliged to do it really, cause there's not too many other people talking about this, to be honest about the indigenous economy, and I've always thought that, and, uh, uh, one of the papers, I think it's on your reading list, is talking about trying to get more indigenous voices in, in talking about economic history. Um, we'll do, it's gonna be a bit of a, a, a, a bit of a quick tour through 60,000 years, so it's obviously gonna be indicative and, and, uh, um, but, uh, we'll try and do it justice and give you a few themes and some ideas to think about. And um And of course, before you start any presentation, uh, especially on digit subject, you have to acknowledge country on the Nannibal and Nambury country here. Uh, there's a picture from, um, uh, from the Tipinbilla area, um, which, uh, you know, I like bushwalking and so so I really quite like this one, and it's, it's, uh, you know, it's it it reminds us that we are on Aboriginal, uh, land, uh, and, uh, and, uh, an unseeded land of that too, um. So, right. So, no further ado, because it's quite a bit to get through, so I'll I'll try it. Uh, I'm gonna have a attempt to, uh, uh, uh, look at Australian prehistory, uh, which is before, uh, the written sources and things like that. So when you think about history, you think about written sources, but of course most of this all of this period, there was no written sources. There's, there's art on, on, on, on caves and things like that, but it's not in, in, uh, language form. It's a language of visual communication, of course, which does indicate things. Um, I think it's important to have, uh, some basic understanding of customary practises, so I will discuss those, uh, uh, uh, in, in the hunting and gathering economy, which, uh, this is a very political area, even the word hunting and gathering has, uh, become politicised, uh, and we'll discuss that, uh, but, but, you know, that was accepted for many years and it's a, it's a broad description of what's going on. Um, and, uh, it's important to recognise a lot of these practises, uh, still in many parts of the country. Um, so, um, I was hoping to have some basic economic concepts, but not too many of those. I don't suppose that's gonna make too many, uh, uh, sad faces around here. Uh, and I want to reflect on the legacy of the indigenous economy going forward. So why we, why you should be basically why you should be interested in this subject, basically, uh, apart from the fact you're living on Aboriginal land and, and it's our history, to be honest, uh, and and Aboriginal history of course too. So let's see what's going on here. OK, so, having a look at prehistory of Australia Pacific, um, I won't spend much time on Marshall Salin's uh, original affluent Society, that was a book from 1970 on Stone Age economics. Uh, we'll talk a bit about, uh, hunter-gatherer economy, um, versus agriculture and capitalist economies, a bit of debate there with Bruce Pascoe, I'm sure you've heard about, uh, he's written book and it's, he's one of the Aboriginal voices reclaiming, uh, history. And economics to a certain extent as well. Uh, um, uh, and in so talking about the, the economy, you know, the the proto farming practises, is what it's been described as in southwest, uh, Victoria, and of course fire stick farming, which was named by Rhys Jones, an archaeologist, uh, and it is incredibly crucial for our, uh, our modern understanding of the Aboriginal economy. Right, uh, and I will, uh, discuss the process of symbolic and physical dispossession and depopulation in the early colonial period, briefly, even though it's supposed to be a pre-colonial economy, it's important to understand what was lost. So, um, Now this is, this is pictures taken from a book in uh written in the bicentenary, which was uh of, of European colonisation in 1988, published in 1989. Uh and it describes the understanding, so, uh, you know, and in this, in this picture, you've got, uh, uh, sort of, uh, indigenous peoples coming to Australia in, in, um, 40,000 years ago. Uh, Lake Mungo in in southwest New South Wales was where the first uh, sort of, uh, uh, Clear evidence of of of and establishing the 40,000 year timetable. Before that, uh, people didn't really have a clear understanding, uh, and you know, it's nice to have that. But since that time, uh and uh getting into Tasmania, people didn't get there until 30,000 years ago, and this is all enabled by the ice ages, uh, which reduced the sea levels, uh, substantially by more than 100, 100 metres, 120 metres, I think, uh, at the time that you've seen people move here. Um, and moving across South Australia. There are still watery, uh, uh, back gaps, uh, uh, between Bali and Lombok, for instance, and, uh, into New Guinea. So people had to get rudimentary craft across, uh, these, uh, these blocks of water to get to, to Australia. Anyway, so that's what people understood then. This is a more contemporary understanding from a book, um, the Macquarie Atlas of Indigenous Australia. Which uh actually has a handy little chart about the actual sea level sea level things if you wanna think about uh think about uh the process here, which is quite important, uh, and it shows you how um how with the sea sea level um uh being much lower, that that uh New Guinea and Australia was connected and um. And Australia was actually much bigger at various points of time, so you're talking about when you're talking about the economy, the economy was for, for a larger land mass, well that might tell you, oh well, there's more, more land to be used by indigenous, uh, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, um. Uh, First Nations people, um, but, uh, of course at the time in the ice ages you've also got large icy masses over there too, so, so it just means that over time, don't think of a, you know, the long history as being stable, that you know, indigenous people here doing things, things were changing over there, they're adapting with, uh, people adapting with climate change, you know, they had to move around the place all of Tasmania had uh icy, icy patches on it probably at this time, so. In that blue dollar area there, I don't think there was many people living down there, that's in in the Franklin area, there's a big ice sheet over there. Anyway, yeah. So So, um, In, in thinking about things, you know, in economic history it's pretty multidisciplinary, so the archaeologists and and a new features reasonably strongly in these sort of debates, cos it's obviously uh interest for Australian National University. Harry Harry Laranda, uh, talked about the intensification of economic activity in the Holocene period, uh, and demonstrated archaeologically, that that is that people were living in more dense uh uh accumulation, especially in, in, in, in, um, Victoria, where he in um Gujamara country, um, near, uh, yes, I've got bujabiim I think is the name of the, the current, uh, uh, area, uh, and, uh, sort of a park area. And, uh, during that time there's increasing complexity in social relations and economic growth, so people were living, they living in one spot, uh, and, um, you know, and this is inferred by population sizes and, and the technology. So in, in the area I was looking at the Gujamara country, there were eel farms and earthworks, which were actually literally were quite massive technological achievements and really quite worth noting. Uh, you know, they turned the water flows around, um, you know, changed the direction of flow, so this is, uh, you know, hydrologically very, very interesting. Uh, and diseases with high density were were associated with those communities and so it, it provided evidence of intensification. So, um, so things changed in various times, particularly about 6000 years ago, so I probably haven't written that down here, but in the late Holocene, it's we're talking about 6000 years ago. Right, um, and so it, it's important for thinking about technology because economics is about thinking production and things like that, uh, but carrying capacity is how much, how many people could be, could live in Australia. That's one of the, the questions that, that I looked at and many people have over the years, anthropologists, archaeologists, and all these sort of people. And so what's the carrying capacity, uh, uh, of the continent? And that depends on what the level of population uh technology is, and it would have changed about 6000 years ago. So let's think about some of uh technologies and the associated. Um, uh, economies. Um, the, um, bogong moths, uh, uh, you know, is something that used to be an awful lot of, frankly, the flying around, um, uh, you know, in 1988 and things like that, the Bogong moths are flying into the new Parliament House all the time. And, you know, there was phenomenal numbers of them, and, and, uh, they excavated, which is the summer hibernation up in the mountains in Tipinbilla. And, you know, if you went up there, you know, I've been up there many times, you can actually see them in the estivating other things and. And there were so many that you could uh they in indigenous people invited tribes from all around the country to uh to come and uh have a a festival, uh, and so they had a joint celebration across tribal boundaries. Eel traps which uh Larandas was looking at is in this light green area here, let me see if it's this working, you can see that, uh, down there, um, and yeah, they were, they were quite amazing, so the, the eels got trapped in these stone constructions and couldn't get out and of course they were easily harvested. The grain belt's actually really another fascinating area um that somebody called Tyndall looked at that, uh, uh, Bruce Pascoe also uh described he he describes the grain belt as a bit bigger than this, but this is, uh, this is the agreed upon area, um. But, um, you know, and this part of the country is really currently very deserty country, so, so, you know, this is having an economy where where where people are growing grain and there's evidence of grain grinding equipment and things like that going on these areas, um, it's actually important, uh, to think that that you know people were living in these areas and they found sustenance in a way that, uh, the modern economy doesn't really, um, so there's a productivity going on here. Um, I'm not quite sure. I don't understand the no fishing in this, but that's down in Tasmania there was no fishing. That's apparently of interest to, to anthropologists and archaeologists. Um, dugong hunting up, up, um, uh, in the coastal waters off the northern, northern things, um, north, northern, uh, uh, coastline. Um, and hawks, uh, which are up in in uh eastern, um, sorry, western, western Northern Territory. I do, OK, let me. So, oh listen, get a few pictures here, um, and these eel traps were, uh, this is the Lake Condo region is, uh, it's now currently called Budget bin, but this was, uh, if you go have a look at the atlas of Indigenous Australia, you'll see lots of, uh, interesting and easy to understand descriptions. You know, I think everybody should know a bit about Australian history and it's a very important part of it. Um, and these are, these are some of the, the stone, uh, stone walls that were described there. It's actually, sorry, there's a very interesting anecdote there about after the 10 point plan in 1997, uh, certain farmers started taking down these things because there was evidence that indigenous people were living in the country and which, uh, uh, since we're in the, the law section here, that's actually quite important for proving native title. Um, so anyway, that's a disgraceful episode in Australian history if it were true. Uh, and I'm not going to present evidence here to prove that. Uh, But uh the point is, is actually um uh uh. Fishing, um, traps all around the country, um, uh, in Torres Strait and also in Borina in northern New South Wales. Um, let me see that's got, um, this is the, the Buddger bin, uh, this is, uh, one of the stone houses. People, you know, people don't, uh, you know, the actual technology to build houses and to live well. This is part of the evidence that Lauranders was talking about, but of course the Aboriginal people knew about it as well. He was just an archaeologist who was. Talking about in the context of the literature. Um, And there's a link uh to to an SBS video which hopefully is still active. I'm sorry, I didn't check that. Uh, this is the uh uh a map in 1906 of uh Brewarren, um, uh, fish traps, where, where the, um, the Darling River flows in one direction and and the and the fish get caught. So this is a a way of enhancing the productivity of the area. Uh, this is a more recent picture of the, the fish traps which are still there. So, hunter-gatherer versus agricultural and capitalist economies, well, um, now the colonial narrative, as I'm describing is that hunter-gatherer modes of production are what existed for the bulk of uh humanity's history. Um, people hunt for animals that are mobile and gather and collect plants and animals which are less mobile, you know, it's a very, uh, simplistic way of looking at it, uh, and, uh, and, uh, reductionist too, I would say, probably, without, uh, Uh, the advent of agriculture, almost 10,000 years ago was thought to happen in Mesopotamia and in other parts of the world in, in South America, uh, uh. It led to surplus production which led to uh support large sedentary populations in one place. Well, as we've seen that was happening in Australia 6000 years ago too, so without contact with the rest of the world, uh, um, you know, it's uh, it has bear some symmetry with the agricultural way of looking at the world surplus production, uh which uh uh produces resources to expand population. Um Uh, and, and in the local part of the world, uh, Papua New Guinea is actually famous for, for being one of those sites of domestication of animals, uh, particular, uh, terraces which, uh, for, for sweet potato or yams. Now, um One question for modern archaeology is why technological innovation, you know, this colonial narrative, why it didn't cross the Torres Strait, uh, to the Australian mainland, even though it's very close, you know, it's 11 kilometres, uh, uh, sort of, uh, to the island, so island hopping is really quite easy, um, and, um. And um but uh that's, that's sort of, uh, construction is a bit uh naive anyway, in that, uh, you know, in my, I, my belief, I don't have any proof of that is that uh indigenous people actually knew about the productive thing, so they didn't really need it because they were productive enough as it was, um, but, um, but, uh, another way of thinking about this, that uh there was domestication and farming practise in Torres Strait. Uh, of, of a more, uh, of the type that is more recognisable in the conventional, uh, western narrative about, uh, agricultural societies. Uh, and, um, you know, and, and native title was recognised in the Torres Strait in, in the Murray Islands, where, um, where, where, where there were, were, uh, farming like practises there. I mean people had plots of land, you know, owned by families and things like that. So it's probably not a coincidence that the legal system recognised that because it was more recognisable to people. In the, in the legal system. Uh, yeah, I might skip over this just in a second. There's an interesting book by Harari, a rather populist, uh, uh, um, uh, populist, uh, uh, historian, big, big history sort of person talking about, uh, which is really quite interesting, and, uh, you know, and, and talking about, uh, farming, uh, uh, and, and, uh, violence. Uh, and, and saying that the romanticised notion of farming, uh, practises is, is much overstated, that there was a lot of disease and, uh, and violence that went with that and, you know, concentration of power and in particular elites as well, but um. I think it's probably more important to talk about Dark Emu, as I, I flagged earlier, and Bruce Pascoe, and, and it's important for someone like Bruce to claim economic history from colonial sources. It's not without, uh, controversy. Uh, people, uh, uh, contested, uh, his, his, uh, his record, but it's, uh, it tells such a compelling narrative that as a book, it was, uh, you know, a bestseller in 2013,014, 2014, you know, apparently. Um, where, yeah, book groups around the country were reading it, so it's really changed the view of Australian history, but it was actually well-known a lot of these things, but people weren't talking about it, so it was just a major achievement to get, uh, in the Australian consciousness. So, uh, seeds made by natives and, uh, this is, uh, this is the explorer Mitchell, I've forgot his first name, uh, but he did 3 voyages, uh, did 3 trips around New South Wales. He was quite sympathetic with the indigenous people in his first, uh, uh, exploration. Uh, and he documented, uh, the seed usage and made it a paste and bread. So that's the tindo map I'm telling you, telling you about, you know, people were getting collecting these seeds and grinding them, uh, together. Uh, Mitchell recorded at least in his first exploration before he got co-opted by the colonial enterprise, uh, at least according to the narrative by, uh, Bruce, um, expressed astonishment at the size of the villages, you know, in one house capable of housing, uh, 40 people. And very solid structures too, where structures which horses actually rode over the top of. So, you know, it's like, uh, um, yes, it was a, you know, very, very well constructed. Uh, yam daisies, another form of cultivation, um, uh, which, uh, which, uh, were abundant when, uh, indigenous people had stewardship of the, the land, but they became, uh, a little bit, uh, uh, uh, a little bit more scarce when hoofed animals and superphosphate came around. Um Uh, so wild grasses and rises, uh, that's, uh, uh, you know, um, also, uh, exist around the place, and, uh, somebody called Tim Denman, a colleague of, uh, of, uh, Um, uh, Frank and I, um, talked about horticultural experiment experimentation that occurred in northern Australia at least 10,000 years ago. So, so the narrative that, you know, that, that, that there wasn't sort of horticultural, you know, uh, experimentation and, and, uh, agricultural like activities is doesn't really carry that much weight really, because certainly there was land management and, and, uh, in innovative, uh, horticultural techniques going on. Um, Oh yeah, um, Rupert Gerrison and Bruce talks about Rupert Gerrison suggests the storage of surpluses, uh, is one indication of agriculture, and feed storage is, uh, is, is used in the agricultural narrative to demonstrate, uh, uh, agricultural activities. caching and stockpiling in direct storages and, um, you know, cashing in, in, uh, in kangaroo hides is one example which occurred in, in the New South Wales area in particular. Right. So this is a picture of a little yam daisy taken from Bruce's book, uh, there. Um, and this is a little bit of experimentation that, uh, uh, uh, of, uh, of making food products from various, uh, indigenous, uh, grains that were cultivated, which are probably different to the, uh, the wheat varieties. So in a sense, it's, uh, uh, a sort of, um, um, uh, talking about, uh, bush tucker and sort of, uh, Uh, by the way, the name for the, uh, yam daisy, at least in the Victorian areas Merno, it might even be around around this part of the world as well. Uh, this is a picture of a yam daisy I was very excited about walking up in the Victorian Alps, uh, which I found growing wild. Uh, so, and, and 15 years ago, um, the pastoralism stopped in, in the national park area up, up there, and, uh, and, and the country is rehabilitating itself, you know, by, uh, having got rid of the, the hoofed animals. So, so, um, there's evidence of change, um. You know, you can actually restore the country to its previous, previous state and and there are these. Uh Plants around the place. Now, um, it's important to have a think about the hunter-gatherer economy, and, uh, hunter-gatherer economy is at least an economic way of thinking of it, it requires little capital investment. Uh, accumulation of wealth really doesn't make much sense, uh, because, uh, capital equipment has to be kept to minimum if you're moving around on foot, uh, cause there, there was no beast of burden or, or, or, uh, um, or, or, uh, land craft. There, there was occasional, um, watercraft, by the way, but, uh, not, uh, not, not that much. So, uh, and, uh, one of the, um, one of the key phrases here is that technology, uh, equipment kept to a minimum, but technology was not simple, limited or uniform. So flexibility was the key if you had to, you have to carry things around. So a lot of technology could be used for various things. Uh, the longer that the hunter-gatherer stays in one location, the more scarce food becomes, and the more costs in terms of time spent hunting and gathering because you exhaust the resources in the local area. Uh. Uh, the number of dependents are very important and you know, there's plenty of evidence of the practise of infanticide, uh, when resources were particularly scarce, uh, and this of course, uh, it was a tension with the colonial things, but it made sense for, you know, it's it's institutional practises in the indigenous context was very important for sustaining a, a, a good standard of living in a sense. Anyway, that's probably more controversial thing to say, but um but it certainly was important in trying to understand history, and we can't look at it without um. Uh, you know, we're making too many moral judgments. Uh, factors of production were equally distributed, uh, um, amongst members of the tribe, uh, collective access to land and own labour. Uh, human capital is particularly important to teaching the, the, the, uh, the children once they attained, uh, adulthood through various, uh, uh, and human capital was, uh, uh, was taught on the basis of a sexual division of labour, uh, to, uh, predominantly, although not exclusively. Trade was also, you know, it's one of the crucial things in economy now and then, of course, uh, there were exchange networks across uh uh uh uh thousands of square kilometres of the Australian continent, uh. There were the trading routes, including something called paturi hatchets, chisels, knives, grinding stones, red ochre and other pigments. Um, so, generally things that could be, uh, transported relatively easily, uh, feathers, boomerangs, and sometimes grass seeds. Um, Pittui, um, I always find a pretty interesting thing. It's a narcotic, uh, which is a recreational drug, by the way, but it was also, um, very, very good for, uh, uh, in, when you, when you're hunting, uh, kangaroos, uh, um, and kangaroos, everyone goes for the water source, uh, and, uh, and, um. Uh, local Aboriginal people were, were known to put peturi into, into the water source, and which numbed and slowed down the kangaroos and made them easy to catch, so that's one way to uh enhance your productivity. I mentioned the uh Bogong moth festivals, festivals all around the country really, uh, magpie geese uh harvest in Kakadua area, uh, banya nut in the Bunya Mountains, delicious banyan, so it's, it's illegal to have them now, but I had it before they change, I have to say, um, before the law was changed, uh, swan eggs in, in Western Australia, and, uh. And anthropologists really described these exchange networks in terms of social and ceremonial or rather commercial motives, but as Blaney says, the social and economic were lock and key, basically. Uh, without the social bonds, trade wouldn't be difficult to carry out. Uh, and, uh, it's probably less in the modern economy, frankly, um, as well. Uh, uh, Donald Thompson is a, uh, uh, an anthropologist who talked about the ceremonial, uh, uh, gift exchange, um. To, to maintain bonds between tribal groups, and these things are very important, of course that's what the focus of the festivals were. Uh, trade in raw materials was, uh, uh, were important, um, for, uh, for various technologies, for spears, uh, you needed, um, silicate or quartz. Uh basal for axis and fixatives being Spinifex gums, uh, which Spinifex gum is, is an amazing substance actually. I mean, um, talking with the Aboriginal business that actually is trying to get copyright on, on some of the properties of uh Spinifex and uh it can be used in a range of things, not only to fix your, your uh access to your to your um. Uh, your quarts to your, uh, sticks for you to make your spears, but also it has some medical properties as well, which is, uh, coming forth and I hope they get their copyright, uh, uh, uh, through. Anyway, let's, uh, to describe just a few pictures of this, just to let you know what's going on. Um, some people think of, uh, pearls, you know, as exchange that could be thought of like money, but really it was, uh, uh, you know, people traded things, uh, which were seen to be useful for various things. Uh, pearls shells coming down from the Kimberleys and, um, barley, uh, uh, Baylor shells coming from, uh, the Torres Strait, right across the continent. Uh, this is the, just a, a map of, uh, people moving around the place for Bogong moth festivals as described earlier. Uh, the Kosciuszko is a is a central point, but so is the Tipbi areas. So uh the ACT. Um, Ian Keane, as another colleague of ours at the uh at the uh Research Association of Social Sciences, looks at the acquisition, sharing and transmission of knowledge, um, Uh, Wood was the main source of energy. As I said, there was no beast of burden, but the dugouts in the Yolngu country, and that was probably coming from trade with the Macassans in in uh in. In Indonesia, uh Sulawesi, well before, uh, well before colonisation, and the Kimberleys there's a massive tide's probably the largest in the country, and, and some crafts use that to actually move, move around the place and transport goods and people. And as I was trying to indicate before, the portability of goods would, would have been literally weighed against the replacement costs. So if you can, you know, if you can actually repla replicate them in the local area, then, then you're not going to carry them like large distances. Uh arid areas, the country's had few, fewer multi-functional tools because of replacement costs. Uh, communication was largely speech and that's why, uh, written history is not, not, uh, message sticks were, uh, uh, um, We were used to to uh indicate a bearer's identity uh in different uh country. Right. Anyway, listen, there's lots of indigenous technology that you may, that should be interested in, I would say, uh, and it does have implications for the productivity. So, uh, this is a picture of a, of a, um, uh, what is it, convict, uh, artist by the name of Joseph Lycett, and it's, it's very indicative of, uh, the country before colonisation in a sense. Uh, it's, uh, based in, in around the Newcastle area, I believe. And um when you think about fire stick farming, you know, the the fires were used to uh actually uh to actually make the land more productive. I'll get to that a bit further here, but this is a picture of uh uh kangaroos being smoked out by the use of uh low intensity fires and, and the kangaroos come out and are easy prey for the um indigenous um uh hunters. Somebody by the name of Bill Gammage, a historian from the ANU, wrote a book called The Biggest Estate on Earth, which uh emphasised mosaic burning. It's quite an interesting piece. He used a lot of pictural uh uh pictures to actually demonstrate this. Uh, how mosaic burning fire stick farming, and patch burning enhanced productivity to create an orderly landscape that was abundant, convenient, and in many ways providing predictable and resources superior to farming, and that's one reason why farming may have been less attractive. Um, damage has been criticised for an excessive emphasis on the uniformity of the practises across Australia, um, but, uh, there, there were different practises, and of course it depends if you're burning fire, it depends on what the climate is doing level rainfall, what the, what the actual, uh, equipment is. Um, and, um. Uh, one of the, the, uh, the thinkers of, uh, economic history that you might read about if you go on further is, uh, um, Reverend Malthus, Thomas Malthus, who he talked about hunter-gatherers as being victims of nature, uh, which is indicative of the, the, the, the, but, but the, uh, it, it's the complete opposite is true. The indigenous people were, were actually managing the land, um. Uh, so, um, Bill Gammage, uh, and, uh, you know, he used to have run tours here. It's now run by a local indigenous, uh, uh, person, um, uh, where, where, um, walks around the country and shows you, shows you, um, uh, uh, various evidence of, uh, of, uh, indigenous ownership. Uh, there was management over several generations. Um, when you had repeated fire stick farming, silica built up, it meant that the grass sites had to be rotated. That's why they had mosaic burning. Uh, Uh, in the previous picture, the, uh, you know, the, um, uh, demonstrated that elevated positions were quite good for military manoeuvres and hunting. Um, but, uh, if you want to understand a bit about the local area about the ANU, uh, go to, uh, uh, this website here, uh, and have a look for Heritage Trail, which starts just near the Cambria centre, uh, and the bridge there is a starting point for it. And that takes you around, around the country where you can see where, Where you know the story's been told about how people were fire stick farming on Liversage Street and and and and the actual animals were driven towards the creek, Sullivan's Creek, and you know, where they couldn't get across the body of water and were harvested there. Uh, I did allude to the Macassans, uh, that was in, in a, um, uh, Indonesian sailors, uh, who, who traded in trepan, uh, a trade which grew up, uh, in the, uh, 1600s, uh, from China, uh, was, uh, uh, uh, which, uh, was formed a delicacy, uh, I believe, in Chinese cooking still to this day, um. And it continued to the 20th century, uh, but took well and truly before European colonisation, so, you know, there was a lot of contact, international trade going on, um, in contact with the outside world. Uh, and this is when the colonists started to, uh, come. After well before 1770 there were 37 contacts, you know, that had been going on. Uh, and, and all those, uh, many of those episodes involved unfortunate contact and the occasional death even in 1606. Um, But in general, the Europeans saw little value of trade with Aboriginal and didn't want to, uh, and the Aboriginal people didn't want to be discovered, so a lot of these uh European explorers that came around, they, they weren't aware of the indigenous people who were hiding in the background. But um the Macassans did uh did uh engage with uh with the indigenous people uh and um and that was, uh, and one reason for that was that Aboriginal people had no use for trepan. Uh, there was no competition for resources, uh, and they valued the culture and economic trade, so the things that they got from the trade within Mercassens were valuable to them. So glass and other things were can be found all the way traded into Central Australia, um. And another reason why Yolngu were not unfond of Macassans, there were obviously some tensions with the Macassans, you know, cultural differences will do that to almost anyone. Um, but Macassans actually recognised Aboriginal people owned the land and treated them with the respect they deserve. Uh, trade and technological exchanges were evident by those dugout canoes, which actually some had rudimentary sales. Uh, food and drink, uh, they introduce a certain rack like, uh, alcohol, um, properties which are still drunk. Tobacco pipes, cloths, rifles, knives, and tomahawks. Um, And as I indicated, uh, the Aboriginals valued these things because they were traded well and truly inland, you know, away from where the Macassans ever went. The Macassans gathered around, uh, Northern Territory and to Queensland and, uh, uh, Kimberley area, but they never got inland. Now this, uh, we don't really have time to talk about this, but I, I went to the trouble of actually trying to actually estimate the size of the economy by uh just using indirect data from the um, From the uh uh the East India Company, um, the Dutch ECD company, and, and, um. And there was a substantial uh uh sort of uh trade going on, and I don't really want you to look at this in with any any depth except to think there was, uh, that that's your volume of trade increased, uh, uh, is likely to have increased uh by around 1750, and that's when the resources were running running out around the Chinese area in around uh Philippines and uh. In Indonesia, so they were looking further afield and the price had to go up so people could actually have the incentive to go to uh to actually look for trepan and doing the trade. I mean that's what trade is about, you've got to have the incentive and it's got to be incentive compatible for you. Anyway, so it's a bit too detailed for this for this short, short term, but it's important to, to think that, that, uh, the Macassans were, were, were doing uh trade around this time, because one of the other things that, as well as bringing wanted trade, unwanted trade or, uh, one thing was the, um, smallpox outbreak that probably occurred, possibly occurred, we don't know for sure, about 1780. Uh, and there was certainly a hypothesis by somebody, Shirley Campbell, that, uh, we know that, that, uh, smallpox really wasn't that prevalent in this part of the world until about 1750 or so, uh, started to grow more in Sumatra, uh, and then there was evidence, uh, uh, of it, um, I mean a big outbreak in 1770 and 1780. Uh, and, uh, Shirley, uh, who had some Campbell, had the hypothesis that it came to us to, to, um, to, um, Uh, to the, the Australia and that actually led to widespread disease, which, which uh was depopulated much of the Australian continent, but it's there's, it's a debate as to whether or not that occurred or where where that disease came from. Um, Indigenous people were unilaterally dispossessed whether they knew it or not, in 1770 when Captain Cook planted the Union Jack and uh took uh took uh uh the uh ownership of the conduct from the point of view of the British the British, um. Uh, but if you can measure GDP accurately in the immediate post-colonial period, you would have seen a dramatic, um, decline as Aboriginal population plummeted. Uh, and, and hunting and gathering activities, uh, uh, diminished too, as the land was no longer managed because the Commonwealth stopped people using fire stick farming because they thought of fire as a threat as opposed to something that was used to manage the country, um. And um yes, and but the but the European influence and influence of the disease actually led to a substantial fall in the population and hence the economy, which is, You know, 11 measure of the economy is the size of the population in a sense, um, depending on the uh per capita productivity. Uh, so, you know, historically, in the, in the, in, um, western things, uh, anthropologist Radcliffe Brown believed there were 300,000 or so people. Uh, and an economist called Noel Butlin revisited this, uh, and said, oh, there'll be between, uh, uh, you know, using estimates of the effect of disease, said there could be up to 1.5 million, probably 1 million people will say. And uh an archaeologist also from the apparently a lot of people who you know you're sorry about that. Um, it's not a bad thing, you're here at the OU too. Um, uh, John Mulvaney is sometimes, uh, one of the founding figures in anthropology and archaeology, uh, is settled on a figure of 750 to 800,000. Uh So Butlin was radical in a way because he, he was, uh, you know, and, and people don't realise how radical he was. He was looking at, um, trying to, uh, you know, he, he appreciated that the that the economy wasn't understood properly and that the productivity of the observed economy by anthropologists was understated. Because, because people, they had a disrupted economy, they weren't allowed to practise their original practises and Europeans had passed off parts of the country, so you, you, you know, you, uh, the, the actual hunting and gathering activities and and land management wasn't really practical, so the productivity had been reduced and uh disease and other things had. Uh, detrimentally affected the, the, the population size. So, um, the archaeologist and anthropologists estimates to, uh, were likely to be understatements. Uh, Butlin also, uh, talked about resource life, and he was, uh, worried about massacres, to be honest, obstensibly, uh, and, uh, trying to estimate, well, how, how these occurred around the place, uh, uh, willful deaths, deaths and things like that, didn't provide direct information into it, but he tried to think about it in terms of what was the resources that were lost, uh, to indigenous people and how that affected their economy. Anyway, that's uh Uh, the upshot of, uh, of, uh, in the, um, the economic history of Australia is this, uh, this book, uh, this graph here, and Mulvaney talks about the maximum carrying capacity of the continent being 1.25 million. didn't think that was the, the actual level of population, he thought it was much lower, and uh. And, um, he talked about in carrying capacity, so he was thinking about productivity, but in the way that an anthropologist thinks about it, not, to be honest, um, but, um, yeah, no, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a valid way of thinking. And I ironically, Butlin, who is an economist, uh, he wasn't using carrying capacity, he was trying to reconstruct it because he knew what, what the methods they were using were adequate. So he said, well, let's think about what we know, and we know the population in, in 1850, more or less. And what with the level of uh uh uh uh various scenarios about mortality and from smallpox and other diseases, quite detailed scenarios that he drew, he could generate a range of uh uh of populations well above the Radcliffe-Brown thing, but mostly above, above the standard estimates from, um, so. He was arguing for a revision upwards and his and and this this chart which is basically you can see is quite variable, but it, it led to a revision which led to John Mulvaney having his consensus, drawing up the uh the the estimates to about 800,000 or so. And just to think about, uh, uh, you know, the fall in the Australian economy, uh, just in terms of, even if there was a, a productivity was equal amongst European and non-Europeans, in fact, I would think the indigenous economy was more productive in 1788, uh, because, uh, they actually understood the landscape and they actually knew how to use it, um, but if you think about the, um, Where the Australian population, you know, just after first contact with these diseases, about a third of the population died off, um, the Aboriginal population. The colonist population didn't grow substantially until about the gold rushes, or about 1840, and indeed there were more. Indigenous people then until about 1840 or so uh and uh they were in different parts of the country, of course, that's a very important point to make. But um but um. Now, OK, so a few concluding ranks. Um And, and I'm, I'm gonna, this is the, the pre-colonial thing, so I'm gonna talk about there's a recent science article, which actually is really, really interesting, talking about what actually happened over the last 100,000 years. I mean, so we'll take it back a bit further. When, when you think about the Australian continent in southeast Australia, uh, the, the actual, uh, the actual grass, uh, grassland, uh, woodland area, uh, was there was much more bush. Uh, uh, uh, wood, the much more wood, less grassland, and, uh, and shrubs, um, and, uh, and so that was, uh, measured in southeast Australia. Uh, by the time you get to about 6000 years ago or 10,000 years ago, the amount of grassland increased dramatically. So that's showing here that the indigenous effect on the continent was substantial and manifest. So in the pre-colonial period. Indigenous land management practises really increased the, the, the grassland. That's what made Australia an attractive place to colonise, you know, when, when Wentless and Lawson went over the Blue Mountains and looked down into the livable plains, they saw massive grassings. Well, that's perfect sheep country. Nobody there because people died from, from smallpox, uh, at that stage, as you can probably see in that previous chart, um. And um so I you know, that it was, you know, people took the uh the um. Europeans took the took the country. Well, what happened after that? It was very interesting in the science article, is it, it demonstrated that since, um, well, it also, by the way, there was an intensification in this, uh, this data that was seen in the archaeological record which showed that grassland increased population carrying capacity about 6000 years ago, as, as we're talking about earlier. But after 1788, um, The grasslands stayed because obviously the Europeans liked having sheep and producing things on that land, but what actually happened, the lack of land management meant that the number of trees are also diminished, but bush shrubs have increased, and it makes it impenetrable for uh for because there's no management of the fiery landscape. So this is a problem for Australia in terms of the fire risk hazard, is is is one thing going forward, you know, it's one reason why you should be interested in this lecture, I have to say, um. But uh yeah, but it's much less productive and it's important to have indigenous people in the landscape or somebody managing the landscape and in fact the skills engendered fire stick farming is actually a skills that could be used internationally given, given we've exported eucalypts to the US and Canada and South America. So we've exported trees which burn very well and without much. Uh, uh, technology, but anyway, that, that technology and um that knowledge is owned by indigenous people, and it's important to acknowledge that. So that's, that's 11 thing. Uh, so hunting and gathering exists in many parts of the country. It's, uh, you know, sometimes people talk about idealised forms, um, uh, related to pre-contact, of course, you know, they, they, they were, uh, you know, and, um, and so it's a very high level discussion, um. But the act of engaging in a modern economy fundamentally transforms hunting and gathering, so, uh, now, uh, there's incentives to engage with the Aboriginal economy's incentives to use guns, of course, and Toyota Hiluxes and things like that, of course that's what's used by remote communities, you know, so. Um, so it's a different type of economy, but fundamentally the knowledge is, is still the same. And that last point is the point I was just making. So hopefully that's uh wrapped up in adequate time. Thank you. Mhm.

SPEAKER 1
Thanks so much Gordon to have uh an account of some of the really recent research findings as well.

SPEAKER 2
I didn't actually put on the list there, but I can find it for you. That's it's a bit sciencey sorry and it's in the

SPEAKER 1
journal Science, yeah, so you know, remember when, when a colleague um refers you to these things, you'll almost certainly find them on the university catalogue. OK, so, you know, the university, those of you who are new to the university. Uh, it has, uh, you know, really quite outstanding journal databases, so, um, you know, this is something that if you're logged into the university catalogue, you can easily get access to, to, to really the very latest research. So, um, if I could just again ask you to thank Boyd for, for a terrific talk. And um And great, so, um, obviously you've got uh no tutorials this week, they they're coming up next week and we'll see you for the next round of lectures, uh, early next week, so thank you very much.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, no, that's good. Oh no, not, no, no, it's 52, yeah, it means

SPEAKER 1
that um the recording will have caught everything, so it's good. I usually go to see you, see, I usually go 2 minutes overtime and they, I, I get emails from students. The lecture cut out, you know. So, so, um, yeah, no, it's it's good, um.

SPEAKER 3
you. I think it's probably worth doing it's probably it's not the usual thing that you're getting um. I thanked him for that. That was. And so Did did you sort out your you sort

SPEAKER 2
out your issue. I that she's she's 94, um, but uh she.

SPEAKER 3
The it's pretty much she she has to show up.
