SPEAKER 1
Have Peter with his extensive expertise and experience and so without further ado, over to Peter. Thank you. Thanks very much mention, of course, professor in the Crawford School here at. Sort of mainly in the Coombs building now, but I'm in appropriately in the oldest building on the campus, the old Canberra house, um, dealing with um heating issues. Anyway, um, so what I'm going to talk about is um I'll start off talking about, What um how big are welfare states and, and why do we, well, actually I'll start off talking about why do we have what's called the welfare states, and then go through some of the main features of the development of the Australian system and in particular why our system is um not quite unique. New Zealand has a broadly similar system in many respects, but um we are have our social policy model is very different from most other high income countries. Uh, and I'll discuss that as well. So, um, now, so how big is the welfare state? These are OECD figures, um. I did them for 2019 because things went crazy in 2020, people might remember. Um, uh, the US spent an extra 6% of GDP on social policy in that year, um, which is an awful lot. But anyway, this is um this is relative to total government spending, um, this is spending on what's called social security and welfare and public and public spending on health, um, as a percentage of GDP. So you can see Australia. This is, this is a share of total government spending. So this is what governments do. So what you can see is that in Southern Europe, we're talking about 60% of total government spending is on social security and welfare in Australia we're a bit under 50%, um, and just above the OECD average. So, so in a sense, the combination of social security, welfare of community services, things like childcare, aged care, uh, disability care, um, this is what governments do, basically, uh, in high income countries, um, it's lowest in places like um Mexico and Korea, um, uh, mainly because they have much less advanced social policy systems. Um I don't know, I don't know how many of you have the joy of paying much income tax. Um, this is, um, on your income tax return, this is something I think, um, Either the Turnbull or Morrison government set up, they tell you where your income tax goes. So this is not total government spending, and I calculated this from my income tax return. You'll get the same numbers from every income tax return, right, because it doesn't matter how much tax you pay, this is the share that goes on different things. So the federal government, um, 39% of all the income tax they spend goes on Social Security and welfare. Um, and nearly 20% on health, and you can see those two items at the far left and on health are by far the largest components. I mean, defence, um, which we pay a lot of attention to, is only 7.7% of federal government spending, so, um, and. One of the other things that's important to note is that um, In terms of, in terms of Social Security and welfare, the biggest spending is on the aged, so that's the age pension, um, and also aged care services, um. Spending on the unemployed is only about 3% of of where our income taxes go. As I said, you could um you could every income tax return will have the same percentage, um, it just tell you different dollars depending on how much tax you pay. Um, so I'm gonna talk about why we need social policies, uh, and go through, um, the life course, uh, risks. Uh, a bit of comment about economic growth and restructuring and, uh, addressing poverty and inequality. Now, There is one thing that every person who has ever been born has in common. Uh, they start life like this, right? They have to be looked after. Um, now, and not everybody ends up, um, in old age, of course, because things happen during people's lives, but if they do, um, people's lives end in vulnerability as well. And now the life course, um, there was a, uh, social scientist in the UK, uh, in the 19th century named Sibo Rowntree, who um, whose family owned the chocolate factory in York. And he was a philanthropist, and he described the life course of a working person in York based on, um, he was able to get, he knew exactly how much his workers were paid, um, and he did a survey talking about how you starve from vulnerability being cared for, uh, you become an adult, you go into work, um. Uh, you have children and then your needs increase, um, or you have extra mouths to feed and then ultimately you retire or you may become ill. So, so everybody has a life course of one sort or another, and everybody starts depend totally dependent on other people. The other thing that happens um is um uh what usually get called as risks. Now there's a longitudinal survey funded by the government and conducted by the University of Melbourne called HILDA, the Household Income and labour Dynamics in Australia survey, and it's followed, um, it's uh followed essentially the same people, um, asking them questions every year since 2001. Now, um, this is just, um, The 1st 10 years because people drop out of the survey, um but um between 2001 and 2008, which was some of the most prosperous years in Australian history, um between 40 and 50% of Australians experienced a drop in income, um, and about 10% fall fell more than 20 percentiles. That means that their incomes fell by at least one quarter and up to 13. Um, so around half of the people who are in the richest 20%, At the beginning of the survey, beginning of the survey, um, we're still in that income group, um, 7 years later, but the other half had dropped out of the richest 20%. Similarly, um, uh, nearly around 40% of people who were in the poorest 20% of the population at the beginning of the survey were in a richer income group, later, you can actually also see this, um, There's a People are aware of the Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes unemployment figures every month, they also um uh look at what are called labour market flows, so, uh, The most recent months, the figures were published for were March. We'll get the April figures in a little bit later this month, I think. Um, so between February and March 2025, the number of people the ABS classified as unemployed went down by 13,000. But if you look at what happened over the previous three months, um, 10 times that number lost their job. Um, of that 130,000, um. Uh, nearly half got another job in that 3 month period. Um, a bit less than that, 47,000 remained unemployed and 20,000 left the labour force. In addition, people move from being outside the labour force to being unemployed because they finish education or training and they get a job, um, or they return to work for various reasons. So, so, um, the labour market and everything that happens to people. is a flow where lots of people get affected, particularly by unemployment. Now the other main reason why people's incomes drop in the Hilda survey is either they or a family member has a serious illness or injury. So health problems, um, they're particularly accelerated at older ages, but health problems are actually the most common causes of income drops followed by unemployment, and then break up of families is the third most important factor. But people advance also because um they get jobs and then progress in their career and so on. Um, so if you look at um. Receipt of Social Security payments. These are social security payments going to people of working age, so it doesn't include the age pension and it doesn't include any of our family payments or childcare assistance. Now in the 1st 10 years or 8 or 9 years of the survey amongst households below the head was below the age of 65, um, nearly 2/3 of households contained somebody who received an income support payment. So it's actually and the longer time period you look at, the more that percentage increases. So um basically, these risks are really, really common and so the proportion of people who don't experience somebody in their family getting a social security payment is actually a minority. However, when we think of um social security payments. Particularly in some of the political discourse, people talk about it as if you know they're bludges, um, and they're sort of um not incentivized to work and they stay on payments forever. Now, however, this is the same survey, um, what it says is um, While 2/3 of working age households contains at least 1 person received a payment, um, the proportion of households who received more than 90% of their income for the whole for the whole period was 1.2%. So basically what this says is that everything that causes people to need a social security payment is actually much more common, but the intensity is is is less strong. Um, the, um, As I said, um, this is at the top is a quote from Paul Krugman, the, uh, the, um, um, American economist, um, who people might know is a a critic of the current American government, but anyway, um, he got a Nobel Prize, um, not from the Nobel Foundation, but from the economics group, um, um, for work on trade, and he back in um. Uh, 2012 described the American government as uh basically an insurance company with an army on the side, and that in a sense if you think of the figures I gave you for Australia, that, you know, sort of, um, 60% of what the Australian government collects in income tax goes on social security, welfare and health, and 7%, less than 7%, less than 8% goes on defence, um, that's what we are as well, um. Now just to reiterate, um, income varies across the life course and there are individual risks and income changes. So social spending acts sort of like as a piggy bank that you know people put money in when they're paying taxes and they get it out when they need it. They also have to deal with macroeconomic changes, um, so, uh, when you have an economic recession, um, Automatically, tax collections go down and unemployment benefit spending goes up, so they help stabilise the economy. However, some of our recessions caused major structural changes and then and then they have to also be dealt with through social policies. The COVID pandemic is a really good example of something that's sort of an economic shock as well as a health shock. In Australia we temporarily doubled the level of unemployment payments for about 6 months to deal with that, and we also introduced a massive subsidy to keep people attached to their employers. As I said, in the US um they spent much, much more on unemployment payments. They they doubled their unemployment payments for it. Most of the year as well, um, so, so, so social policy is a tool of economic management. It also deals with not only with the things that happen to everybody, so to speak, or can happen to everybody, but it also tries to deal with poverty and disadvantage. um, so, um, there's a UK economist Nicholas Barr um who um sort of talks about. Uh, social policy is being either a piggy bank or like Robin Hood and there's. I'm not sure how many of you you've seen the Robin Hood movies or the television series, um, but you know, the, the story behind it is allegedly that he took from the rich to give to the poor. So that's, uh, so Nicholas Barr said that was um, Uh, what social policy, those, those were the two main focuses of social policy. Well, now, there's also a literature about um different, how do you get entitled to social protection? Now um in, Northern Europe in um Norway, Denmark, um, and Sweden, I um um uh, There's a famous book in social policy which has 43,000 citations in Google Scholar, uh, for those who are counting, um, which says that those countries are social democratic and they allocate uh social benefits as a right of citizenship. Um, the conservative countries are places like Germany, Austria. Uh, Switzerland and um and France, um, where people make contributions through separate from their income taxes, um, and that they and their employer make contributions, uh, that then, um, entitle them to their payments, whereas, uh they're also liberal welfare states, and uh Sing Anderson thought that um, Uh, uh, basically the English speaking countries, um, particularly Australia and New Zealand, emphasise income testing, so we emphasise that, uh, you get entitlements on the basis of, um, low low income. Now, Essentially, the structure of economies and um the um the nature of wage setting institutions, your type of tax structure and and what you spend money on are all interrelated. Um, so in Australia we don't have social security contributions. We talk about the Medicare levy as if it's a social security contribution. Uh, but it, um, it's, it's just a sort of a different form of income tax really. Um, also different systems have different assumptions about the role of men and women, um, what you do about people with disability, and also particularly, um, something that's coming much more uh a subject debate is about, um, what are migrants' rights to social security entitlements. Um, now the welfare state, um, uh, a British historian Asa Briggs, um, said, um, that the phrase welfare state was, um, first used to describe, um, what the, um, um, the Labour government, um. Did it after 1945, Clement Attle succeeded Winston Churchill. So the term welfare state, according to Briggs was relatively recent. Um, there's a German term, I pronounce it correctly, so start or something like that, social state, but it's been used since 1870 because, um, when, when Germany unified in 1870, um, they started partly to keep the socialists out of parliament. But partly because they had to allow free movement between different parts of Germany, they, they introduced social insurance, so that the term social state has been used in Germany since 1870. The Swedish term for welfare state is literally a translation of the people's home. So it's the idea of protection. Um, now, essentially welfare states developed, started developing in a way, uh, from the beginning of the 19th century, um, and it was basically a byproduct of industrialization, um, so, uh, previously, um, uh, yeah, if you, if you were part of a, um, A village that village was responsible for your uh for your if something went wrong, and also in particular it was also the the church, and churches played different roles in different European countries, and it was particularly, it became a state responsibility in England because um it was an official church, right? It was a um separate from the. Uh, the Catholic Church, um, now, and so people moved away from, uh, rural areas into cities, um, uh, they didn't have that protection of, um, Of their community or their extended family, um, and so what there was some, So there was an awareness of this process that created tremendous economic growth also created problems as a byproduct, and the, the two traditional methods of dealing with these sorts of social problems, um, charity or philanthropy and um in many European countries what were called the poor laws um were over time began to be seen as being inadequate, um, and, uh. So these problems of the problems that actually were a byproduct of economic growth, um, came to be seen as more and more salient. And so they developed in Europe, North America, and Australia, um, um, beginning in the 19th century, but it took quite a long time for that, uh, to, to work its way through. Um, so for example, um, there was a, and it tends to start with regulation of working conditions, um, and in fact there's a, Um, a, a book, I think it is still available, uh, called Social Security Around the World which is updated, um, by the American government, if they're still doing it. Um, um, in just about all countries, the first social programmes. Uh, and this is literally a list of all social programmes in all countries that have them, um, with workers' compensation. So if you had an accident at work, what, what, what, you know, what, what are your entitlements? Um, and, um, there was a, so there was a factory Act in England in 1802, and there was a law in Prussia in 1839, starting to restrict, um, uh, child employment. Um, so it was about protecting people as they develop. Now, um, Partly because. Australia was a new country at the beginning of the 19th century, um, and we, um, uh, We were largely colonised after um after the French and American revolutions, um, well, the French revolution was going on while we started being colonised, um, and also because um there was a a labour shortage for particularly at the time of the gold rushes, um, uh, we, many of our states, um, introduced, um, Compulsory arbitration. So these were not courts, but there's still the Fair Work Commission, which sets some terms and conditions of employment, and that's a sort of a descendant of what started in the 19th century. And so what happened in Australia was that we had a lot of regulation of employment conditions well in advance of. Uh, Europe or America, so, um, I think, uh, Victoria was the first jurisdiction in the world to introduce the eight hour day in about 18 before 18, just before 1850. Um, now the, um, this led people visiting Australia, um, to, um, see us as um, Um Sort of at the vanguard of Social protection, but social protection through the setting of employment conditions. Um, so, uh, Henry Giles Turner was a visitor to Australia from the UK, um, um, and in 1882, he said, um, uh, It may safely be said there is no country in the world where the material prosperity and substantial comfort of the working classes are so assured isn't in Australia, um, uh, towards the end of the, um, well, uh, no. A little, a little later in 1901, a French person, Alfred Metin visiting Australia, wrote a report for the French government called Socialism Without Doctrine, which is what he described Australia as. It was like socialism, but um. But without, without actually being socialist, um, uh, in fact, there's also, um, I think Lenin in 1917 condemned Australia as pretending to be socialist but not actually, um, but it was it was about the way the arbitration and wage setting systems um meant that if you had a job, um, uh, you were, um, assured. A decent wage. So, so, so it was, it was through the setting of employment conditions and wages that this prosperity was guaranteed. Um, there's actually, um, there's a lot of, um, I don't know whether you go to into this in other parts of the course, um. You know, there's a um. There's a book by Russell Ward in the 1950s called The Australian Legend, which is, which is about all this idea that this is the land of the fair go. Um, the, the idea that we're the lucky country is sort of, I think, um, uh, not, not, I'm not sure cynical is the right word, but it's a sort of a critique of, of some of, some of those uh those concepts, um. Uh, Vance Palmer wrote a book in, um, in 1954 called The Legend of the 90s, um, again emphasising, you know, the how well off Australian workers were. Um, politicians like this. So, um, uh, in 1967, uh, Harold Holt said that he, um, knew of no other free country where what is produced by the community is more fairly and evenly distributed. Um, and there've been, there have been various other, um, uh, So it's a theme in a lot of historical writings about Australia, um, now this is, um, I don't know how many of you have read Age of Extremes, Eric Hobsborne, um, his book about, um, Uh, the short 20th century, um, so that's a picture of Charlie Chaplin being Adolf Hitler, so to speak, uh, on the cover, but, um, he has, he has about 7 references to Australia in this, in this volume. Uh, two of them, one on page 356, talks about, um, income inequality and says that, um, uh, Australia had the lowest level of income inequality of any country apart from Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which at the time were communists, right? Um, but then, um, about 50 pages later it refers to the evidence that came out, started coming out in the 1980s when we actually got comprehensive income surveys saying that we were one of the most unequal countries, so. Um, I'm doing some work on this, this idea that, you know, did something happen between the 1960s and the 1980s, or was this all a myth to start off with? Anyway, um, as I said, um. Um, well, Victoria established the eight hour day in 1856, and most of the separate colonies introduced minimum wages in the 19th century. Um, in 1904, there was a a conciliation and arbitration court. Um, so, it also, um, one of its important things, um, was it set, um, sick pay. So in a lot of other OECD countries, if you become sick and are temporarily unable to work, it's the government that pays you a benefit, whereas in Australia, if you're not a casual worker, you get you accumulates the over your working life. Um, if you're a casual worker, you don't, of course. Um, in 1907, there was what's called the harvester case where, um, Uh, they introduced the concept of the basic wage. Um, this was part of a trade-off, um. Between protecting working conditions and imposing tariffs on foreign imports, um, so. Sort of relevant to some of the debates at the moment in other places, um, and the idea was this was a wage that was set for, Um, a man, and that's what it says in the in the judgement, a man, his wife and 3 children, um which was reasonable for a human being living in being in a civilised community. Now that that approach has gradually changed quite significantly over time, but the basic principles were around for most of the next 70 years and it's still there in the in the Fair Work Commission. So the, so. The minimum wage, I think only applies the actual minimum wage only directly applies to about less than 2% of workers, but about 40% of workers have their terms and conditions set by awards, and all of the awards are more generous than the minimum wage. So what we still have an institution. That sets pay and working conditions for 40% of the workforce, uh of employees anyway. Um, so Frank Castles, who was a um Another um ANU professor for many years, but also um. Uh, worked in the from the UK, um, led, he described Australia as the wage earners' welfare state. So these features of high minimum wages, low unemployment after the Second World War, um, Easy access to owner occupied housing at the time, and the targeted system of our benefits, um, led to low levels of poverty by international standards. Um, now, as I said, when you go back to the harvester case, it talks about a man, his wife and three children. Um, so in fact for most of the period up until the 1970s, um, um, women were actually paid, you know, sort of, At statutory rates lower than men, um, so we didn't get equal pay till I think, um, uh, sometime in the 1970s, um, and so this was, um, and of course it also, um, didn't extend to indigenous people, um, they weren't part of this, they were, um, uh, and there was a lot of um wage theft, um, and also of course for the first part of the 20th century, um, we had, What's called the White Australia policy, so we kept, um, uh, uh, people out. Now there was also um in our social security system, um there was also um, There was also exclusion of Uh, people from Africa and the Pacific and people from Asia, they weren't entitled to social security benefits, um, and, um, some interesting policy debates about, um, where does Asia actually start and um there there are also cases where they had to decide, you know, some Armenians look European, right, but, um, are they really because it's in Asia. So there's a sort of, so there's this whole history of um. of immigration and race also underlying this model. Um, now, basically, um, In many respects, the system we have now um reflects some of these original assumptions. Um, so, um, Frank Castles in a separate article in 1997, um, noted that, um, since the first schemes of Commonwealth income support were introduced in 1909, um, the social security powers were transferred from the states to the Commonwealth. Um, there were 5 features that remained fundamental to all of Australia's main income support benefits. They were income tested as the criterion of need, and they were also asset tested in various ways. Very importantly, they lasted as long as need lasted. um, now, if you become unemployed in the US, you get a more generous unemployment insurance payment than you do here, um, but unless there's a very high unemployment, you only get it for 3 months, right? Uh, and in most other countries in Europe, um, uh, the most generous unemployment benefits last for six years. Here, so long as you remain unemployed or as long as you have a disability, um, it is potentially indefinite. Um, they were all funded from general revenue, but they also replaced only a relatively small proportion of average wages. So as I said, Frank Castle said this in 1997, and that's still the case today. Um, I was actually able to get, um, there's a book, um, uh, by Ronald Mendelsohn, uh, who was, um, I think he provided advice to the government in the 1940s, um, uh, onwards, um, going back to 1901. So this is Social Security and welfare. They were different colours when I think I did them, uh, anyway, um, and you can see that, um, spending was, you know, like this is about, um, 1% of GDP in 1901, uh, which, um, by 1910 it had grown a bit and then it sort of steadily increased. There was a jump between 1940 and 1950 because that's when we introduced, um, uh, payments, uh, payments for children, um, and we also introduced unemployment and sickness benefits at the time, because there wasn't a national unemployment and sickness benefit. Uh, but there were state schemes before that. Um, then the next big jump was between 1970 and 1980. Uh, now that the main reason for that was, um, was our first bout of stagflation, so we had high unemployment and, and high inflation, um, and unemployment, um, I mean, in 1961, I think the Menzies government nearly lost office because the unemployment rate increased to 2.1%, um. Uh, but, um, uh, but, you know, so it was very low for, um, most of the period up to the 1970s, and then you have this steady increase, um, now, uh, But since 2000 it started to go down. Now this is what happened in 2020, and this is because we temporarily doubled unemployment payments and we also um the JobKeeper payment which was paid to firms, is counted as an employment subsidy in the OECD figures. So we temporarily went up to about 22% of GDP. The most recent figures are that we started to come down, um, so you can see. This long-term increase, um. These, these increases were much greater in European countries because they had much more generous systems. Um, Uh, this is um Again, uh, this is spending on the particular social security programmes, so, um, the blue bars at the bottom are age pensions, which as you can see, are the, are the, the most significant, uh, so currently, um, Currently about half the people receiving the Social Security payment are on age pensions, so in total, at a point in time right at the moment there are about 5 million people receive an income support payment and about 2.5 million are on an age pension. There was a rise in people on disability payments over time. Family payments became much more generous over time, and unemployment payments sort of a highly cyclical depending on the state of the labour market. Um So, uh, does anybody have any questions before I Continue on Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was um and Mendelsohn makes that point is that um we had much more generous payments for veterans after the First World War, because we had one of the highest casualty rates in the First World War relative to our population, um, uh, so there was a there was a repatriation system, so. Um, if you, um, uh, so there's a more generous payment for war widows, um, uh, for people have disabilities as a result of war service, um, and it was a, it was a separate system, um, and there still is a separate system. It's much less important than it was in the past, um, because, um, we haven't been as in as many big wars recently as we were. So as I said, it was introduced as a result of World War One. A lot of people, um, you know, got injured in the Second World War, um. Uh, and then the Korean and Vietnam Wars, um, but the conflicts have been much less, so in fact now many fewer people receive, uh, service pensions rather um, um. Separately, I, again, that's also quite different from, um, so in the UK they don't have a separate Department of Veterans Affairs. The um the US does, but in the UK they don't, um, so, um. Um, one of the things you notice, well, I'd noticed a few years ago when I visited the UK on a regularly, fairly regular basis is that, um, you often see, um, People who identify as ex-soldiers begging, um, um, but anyway, um, now, so. Um, the, um, The age pensions. Were introduced from 1909 and they started paying uh in what were called invalid pensions, um from 1910. The repatriation benefits for veterans started in 1918, and then, um, they were changed to be called service pensions from 1936. Now but we didn't have an unemployment payment. Uh, there were unemployment payments in New South Wales and Queensland in the 1920s. Now, there were actually um, Proposals to introduce social insurance as in overseas countries and and a scheme was actually introduced in 1928 in the federal parliament, but the government lost office in 1929 and elapsed. In 1938, a predecessors of the coalition government introduced actually introduced the legislation passed the scheme, but it lapsed at the beginning of World War II, um, and, um, but during. The Second World War, as in the United Kingdom, um, the sort of, There was a significant expansion of the scope of uh programmes, so child endowment, um, which is now a family tax benefit Part A, was introduced in 1941 for um for the second and larger numbers of children, um, widow's pensions in 1942, a funeral benefit in 1943, and unemployment and sickness benefits in 1945. So there was this big um result of responding to war. Um, now, There was then a big increase, as I said, um, in the 1970s, um, but we've had a lot of reforms of um, Uh, since the 1960s, um, now, when, When unemployment goes from 2%, um, In the early 1990s it was 11%, right? Um, uh, basically what happened, a lot of, particularly older people working in manufacturing lost their jobs. Um, they didn't get their jobs back. I mean this is common across OECD countries, um, and but there was a concern that we should introduce what are called active social policies, um, and that the increase in activation, i.e. requiring people to, um, Uh, increased the numbers of jobs they applied for, um, the penalties for not applying for jobs, um, or being seen to be lingering, uh, were increased, um, the government introduced what they called the Work for the dole scheme, um, the dole is, Not a term in any act, but they so they labelled this act to work for the dole scheme just to Give a message, um, after 2007, the labour government, um, During the Howard government between 2003 and 2008, we had a massive increase in household disposable income in Australia. It was probably the biggest increase in household disposable income since the gold rush. I mean, so it was caused by expanding trade with China, and the um the the the coalition government made family payments much more generous, um, partly to also. Um, try to encourage greater fertility, um, but from 2007, um, when the Rudd Gillard government came in, they started to target, um, so they increased the income testing of these family payments. Now, um, Because of this big increase in household disposable income, um, uh, and because, Our payments are flat rate and not related to your past earnings, um, there was great concern in 2007, 2008 that pensioners were falling relative to community incomes. Um, so in 2009, as part of a tax review, there was also a review of Social Security, and rates of age, disability and carer payments were significantly increased, um. But they also start to pay for it by um gradually increasing the pension age. Um, now, basically, but, but this sort of there were reviews of Social Security in the 1980s, uh, 1 led by Bettina Cass, who's a, a former colleague of mine at the University of New South Wales and then at the University of Sydney, um, uh, which did a fundamental review of the social security system to deal with, um, the consequences of increases in unemployment. In the 1980s, um, and, um, so there've been, there've been regular reviews, but between these regular reviews, basically, um, a lot of the legislation is sort of set and forget. So, um, so, uh, for example, the unemployment payment. Uh, has effectively, uh, it's indexed prices, um, uh, but, um, it does, if national income increases and household disposable income increases, it doesn't keep pace with that. So, um, it's fallen from about 90% of the age pension in the 1990s to not much more than 2/3 of the age pension now. um. If, um, it's an unemployment payment is um a bit less than 20% of the average wage for a single person, um, if that indexation to prices continues, um, the government produces what they call intergenerational reports every couple of years, um, uh, which project for 40 years, um. Uh, it will be 40 years from now, it'll be 9% of the average wage, which would be lower than any other country in the OECD. Now, um, I'm conscious. Of time. Now, as I said, um. We have a very different system from just about everywhere else except New Zealand. um, uh, in Europe, the United States, Japan, um, government benefits are financed by contributions from employers and employees, and they're related to past earnings. So, um, um. Now, so the, the, the. The exact amount to which they relate to past earnings varies across countries, um, and, um, but what that means is that higher income workers, uh, when they retire or if they acquire a disability, um, they receive a higher absolute level of benefits, um, whereas in Australia, when you retire, the basic age pension is exactly the same for for all single people, no matter what their previous earnings were. Um, so in Australia and New Zealand, um. Most government benefits are flat rate entitlements, and they're financed from general revenue, not from these separate social security funds, um, and payments are income and assets tested. Um, so this is, um, if you look at um our spending, because they're income and asset tested and they're flat rate, Australia, um, in terms of cash benefits, we spend about a bit over 9% of GDP in 2019 again before COVID, um, whereas in, um, Uh, France, Greece and Italy, um, you're getting up towards 20% of GDP, um, so you can see these countries over here, uh, European countries, um, um, so. All of the European countries provide much higher levels of payments tend to have more aged people than we do as a share of the population, which is one of the other factors. Now the OECD unfortunately doesn't publish its figures on income testing all that regularly. So these are figures from 2012, but you can see back in 2012. Um, Australia's spent by far the highest on income tested payments, um. Ah, whereas, you know, Denmark and Sweden spent virtually nothing on income tested payments. Um, so we income test more than any other high income country. Um, another way of thinking about this is, um, Uh, this is a calculation from OECD figures where you say how much is the actual amount of money received by the poorest 20% of the population divided by the amount of money received by the richest 20% of the population, um. This is Australia over here, um, so the poorest 20% of the population get uh 1 12.5 times as much money as the richest 20% of the population. Um, the money received by the richest 20% of the population is actually mainly in unemployment payments for young people living at home with their parents, but anyway, um, so in most of countries, um, it's actually around, 0.95 to 0.1212, i.e., all income groups get roughly the same amount of money. Now, um, so we target the poor more than anywhere else, but we spend a lot less than some other countries. Now while their systems are not as progressive as ours. That's incredibly redistributive, cause private incomes are not, you know, the, your, your wages of different income groups are not around one, so, so the social security system, um, is, Even even a ratio around one can be highly redistributive, but we are extremely targeted and and as you can see even in New Zealand, um, because their equivalent to the age pension isn't income tested, um, it's, it's high but but um significantly lower than Australia. Is there a question? Um, Right, I'm gonna stop in a bit, um, so summing up, um. We've got this system that's very different from anywhere else, um. In many respects, the nature of the system. The essential nature of the system has stayed the same over time. This combination of income and asset testing, flat rate payments, not requiring contributions. The growth in spending over time to become what is effectively the largest responsibility of Australian governments, even though it's less than in many other countries, um, is. Reflects changes in um the structure of labour markets over time, um when you go from 2% unemployment for, The best part of 30 years to double digit numbers. Uh, that makes a big difference to how much you spend. Uh, I mean, we're also back to being much lower than we were, um, for most of the 80s and 90s at 4%. We haven't been around 4% for quite a while. Um, there's also, um, population ageing, so the biggest area of spending is on the aged people. Um, uh, that's, um, as the population ages, that tends other things being equal to lead to. Increases in spending on on retirement pensions, um, there's been a sort of a complex pattern of policy changes, um, sometimes we've expanded the generosity of the system and extended coverage, um, and other times we've made it much harder for people to get payments, um. Over the long run, the way you index payments to either inflation or wages is um has a major effect on how much you spend, um as I said that um, There's um we've had these semi well sort of not, not, not regular, but a number of reviews of the social security system, um, but there's also, um, the expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet, uh, which, um, every year decides on um where it's going to spend money and unless it's a, um, unless it's a commitment in an election platform, if some minister wants to spend more money in some area. They have to come up with offsetting savings in their portfolio. So there's there's a big discipline built in to to continuously look for savings because this is where an awful lot of government money goes. So, so, so there's been a lot of fiddling around and those annual budget savings have tended to be less less coherent than what I suggested by the reviews. The, um, so I'll, I'll stop there. I've got I've got a few other slides, but I'm. Um, but, uh, I think time is just about up. I, I, I'm, I'm fine, yeah, yeah. Um, how does superannuation that's a very good question. Um, yeah, so, um, that, um. Yeah, there's been a massive expansion of superannuation, it, because it's because it, it doesn't get paid to government, it's not part of government spending, right, uh, now the tax concessions are, are part of, What are called government tax expenditures, um, so the expansion of superannuation appears to me to have resulted in a significant decline in coverage of the age pension. So when, I mean, um, the Whitlam government, um, started to abolish the income test on age pension, but it was reversed by the Fraser government. Um, the, um, uh, but in the 1970s and 1980s, um, around 90% of people over the age of 65 were receiving either an aged pension or one of the veteran's payments. Uh, it's now.
