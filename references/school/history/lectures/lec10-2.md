SPEAKER 1
I suppose we do. It's exactly the same issue as last night, isn't it? You're thinking it's him, not the system, aren't you? Well indeed, he looked social scientist, quantitative social scientist. On what uh sorry so. OK. Oh yeah, it looks a bit more promising, maybe.

SPEAKER 3
So I used to run a course in um uh

SPEAKER 2
in data analytics with the um computer science people. So when this happened there'd be like 15 people with like get out of that way they sell it they solve, but they didn't, did they? No, just turn it off.

SPEAKER 1
Applying computers.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, is that right?

SPEAKER 1
OK. So we get this far, so that's all good. Oh, OK, good. It was just a matter of persistence, really, resilience they call it, I believe. Uh, now you, you'll be up here somewhere. There we go, that's you there. We'll stick that on the desktop. Here it is. Get rid of that um. And I'm just gonna take that out and all the stuff around with that. OK That's coming up there, isn't it, yep, good, excellent, excellent. Good. All right. And from the beginning. Good. OK, well, thanks, thanks. Um, look, thanks everyone, good to see you all, um, and, uh, uh, I'll acknowledge the traditional owners of the land in which we're meeting the Nunar and Namburi and pay respects to people, elders, and country. With great pleasure, I introduce Professor Nicholas Biddle. Uh, Nick is, uh, a, Leading social scientist, um, particularly quantitative, um, engaged in a whole range of projects. Nick's work with collaborators, for instance, has been, I think, the most influential work done on the voice, which, you know, it's marvellous, which I mean I've got, I must have cited it now, at least 8 or 10 times in different things, but Um, Nick's obviously been very busy recently, uh, with the election, but among, uh, Nick's areas of expertise is indigenous economies. Nick is the head of the School of Politics and International relations and was previously a professor in what is now called POLUS, which is a social research centre here at the university. So without further ado, Nick, thank you.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, so I'd also like to extend that acknowledgement and uh and recognise that we are meeting on Nuwa lands and pay our respects to elders past, present, and emerging, and thank you everyone for coming along today. um. So look, what I'm going to focus on for, we've only lost 2 or 3 minutes, so we, we, we're OK, uh for uh a little under an hour or so is um, Uh, indigenous economies, and with a particular focus on understanding population change and demographic change, uh, as both a response to and a driver of the economic circumstances of First Nations in Australia. With some uh international comparisons as well. Uh, so I understand you have done, uh, at the start, uh, there was, uh, I think there was a lecture you do on a kind of pre-colonial, pre-invasion, uh, uh, indigenous economies. Um, so I'm gonna pick that story up and take it to the present day. Um, one of the things I, one of the themes which really runs through both my work in this space, uh, but also I think in, in, uh, the economic history of the indigenous population is a real, uh, Um, kind of uncertainty around how people are identified, how people identify themselves, and the way in which that drives our understanding of the indigenous population and the indigenous economy. Um, so some of you may remember, uh, in 2021, uh, the census of Population and housing. Uh, most of us do it online now. Um, you probably didn't do it. It was probably done, uh, on your behalf, uh, in your household. Most people have the census filled out for them. Um, it, it's a household form, it's not an individual form, but this is what we're asked, uh, and this is what we will be asked in 2026. And this question is essentially used to understand the size, the scope, the characteristics of the indigenous population, which then flows through into economic and other circumstances. Now our definition of indigenous status is that someone uh to be classified as indigenous, someone should either should have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, identify as such, and also be accepted as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander by the community in which they live, um. That's not what's asked on the census. So already we have some uncertainty. Already we have a uh a a second best uh measure for understanding this very important part of the Australian population. Now the indigenous status question has been constant uh over a number of censuses, uh, a number of years, but people's response to that might change, um. So it might change because of life course variation. uh, so if you are in a partnership and then you're no longer in a partnership, if you're living at home, uh, or move out of home, uh, if you have children, then how you view your indigenous status might change, um. Uh, the way in which the Australian state, uh, um, as represented by state and territory, local, federal government, uh, and, and public service, the way that interacts with the population will influence how willing people might be to identify as such as part as part of a state data collection regime, so. Uh, the Northern Territory intervention where the army was essentially sent into the Northern Territory on the pretext of uh um uh minimising child sexual abuse and community safety was something which was strongly resisted by communities and led to people being reluctant to say as part of a data collection that yes, I'm indigenous. Whereas other events like the apology made by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to Indigenous Australians for the impact of of previous government policies might encourage people to feel more inclined to say yes, they are indigenous. So all of these things matter. um. And they lead to some uncertainty around our understanding of the size, composition of the indigenous population and then how that flows through to our understanding of the indigenous economy and its size and scope. So in the last census, uh, and there's a link down here for a discussion which I think it was with Francis Markham and I, uh, on trying to understand, uh, the, the last count, uh, we had about a little over 800,000 people who ticked yes on this box, uh, that either they are either or both Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanderer. A little under a little over 3% of the Australian population who answered the question said yes, uh, and that was 25% higher than the count in 2016. Now there is very little international migration of indigenous Australians. It conceptually it doesn't make a lot of sense. Some people come, some people go, but it's in net terms it's very little. So, There was a growth of the indigenous population of more than twice the growth rate of the non-indigenous population, and the non-indigenous population was affected by international migration, um, so that is no way in which excess of births over deaths could drive a population growth that high. So what's happening, we'll get to what's happening a little bit, but already there's, there's some notion, even in the, the most recent census where the questions were the same, the method was the same, uh, there was quite rapid growth. Um, there is uncertainty around our estimates of the indigenous population because there are more people who don't answer that question on the census than there are people who say yes, that they are indigenous. Now that's partly because. There's a large number of people who just don't answer any questions on the census, that's unit non-response. But there's also a large number of people who, who will answer other questions but not give their indigenous status. So some uncertainty when we come to understand the size of the population. But when we adjust for that as best we can, we get an overall estimate of a little under a million indigenous Australians as of the 30th of June. So that adjustment takes into account non-response, uh, as well as a small number of people who might have been overseas on the night of the census. So that's We'll come back to this, this change in a little bit, uh, and work through how that recent change compares to a slightly longer history and and what some of the explanations are, but let's take a step back again as a slightly, Uh, larger step back and think about why do we care? Uh, why do we care about understanding the indigenous population. Uh, uh, so that's a slightly narrower question than why do we care about indigenous issues, but this is, you know, why do we care about having a, a measure of the indigenous population, how it's changing. Um, so one is for historical reasons. Um, so, indigenous Australians are the descendants of the original inhabitants, which comes with certain native title rights, uh, and other rights not held by other groups. So we need to understand, uh, who might have that, uh, um, Uh, that family history, uh, which, and, and kind of cultural continuity, uh, which might lead to, uh, having those native title rights which then have economic returns to them, uh, and also other returns to to country and to the environment. Um There's socioeconomic reasons why we might understand this, and this gets again at at this issue of of what's, what is the indigenous economy, how do we understand it. Um, so indigenous Australians are one of, one of if not the most disadvantaged population groups within the country, and therefore there are targets around improving the outcomes of the indigenous population. These targets have been around since, you know, prior to the apology to the Stolen Generations prior to the anti-intervention. These targets have not been met and In understanding indigenous circumstances, we need to understand. How are those targets changing through time and why are we not able to, to meet those in terms of improving uh employment, housing, education, wellbeing, language, a range of other things. Uh, when we think about the indigenous economy, and I'll, I'll give some data on this in a little bit, uh, there's a geographic dimension to it. So even though the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island population makes up just over or around about 3.5% of the Australian population, uh, in certain areas, the indigenous population is a much larger minority or even a majority. And what that means is, is the economy in that area is mostly the indigenous economy. Uh, so understanding the characteristics of that population tells us about the economic potential for that area. So that's geographic regions, but there's reasons, there's also demographic reasons, which is that indigenous Australians make up a relatively high percent of younger Australians uh due to uh relatively high fertility rates and high mortality rates. And what that. there are certain economic policies or policies which have economic effects like schooling, early childhood, which for which the indigenous population is particularly exposed to because of that demographic distribution. So understanding Uh, the indigenous population, uh, helps us, uh, understand or, or, or guide our economic thinking around these areas. So let's step back, um. We use in week one, week two, early on, uh, you, you took it up to 1788. I just fast forwarded to now. Let's go back to 1788 and have a think about the, the trajectory since then. We'll do this reasonably quickly, uh, but it will help, I think, understand, uh, What's changed and and how that's led to the current uh circumstances around the indigenous economy. Um, so, uh, early settlement of Australia dates vary in terms of precise estimates, but, uh, current estimates suggest at least 70,000 years ago when Aboriginal Australians first reached the continent and potentially, uh, some variation around that but potentially even even longer. Uh, and the. Over the time period between that initial settling of the Australian continent and European exploration and colonisation, the indigenous population spread across the country and was distributed based on the economic carrying capacity of the land, so higher density population in more in areas which had greater resources uh um for that population. But estimates at the time of colonisation suggest a population of about 800,000. Some estimates are a little bit higher, some a little bit lower, but we have now returned to a situation where the descendants of the population at the time of colonisation is now greater in size than the size of the population at colonisation. But Uh, I think I've got, yes, um. Oh that that kind of bookend. Uh, um, Uh, kind of skates over a lot of, of, of fluctuation variation over that period. And also variation in how the indigenous population was measured and estimated, uh, uh, which both of which kind of interact with each other. Um, so in understanding the indigenous population and the potential indigenous economy, one of the things to keep in mind is that at the time of federation, one of the, uh, aspects of the, the Constitution was a clause which said that in reckoning the numbers of people of the Commonwealth or of a state or part of the Commonwealth, Aboriginal natives shall not be counted. um, so. What that meant is that not that indigenous Australians were, weren't part of a data collection apparatus, but that, That apparatus did not feed into a uh when we were creating estimates for the population at a local or national level that count of the indigenous population didn't feed into our overall estimate. um so allocation of seats in parliament was not based on the indigenous population in the area, uh, allocation of resources to an area not based on the size of the indigenous population. And that led to a, uh, And and the understandable uh well the the the obvious link or or or follow follow on from that is, is that resources didn't flow to the areas where indigenous Australians lived. Um, And statistical practise postlo Federation, sorry, through to the 1967 referendum, which I'll get to in a second. Uh, had these very complicated ways in which uh people were counted or not counted, depending on their ancestry and what was at the time, uh, called blood quantum or, or, um, other terms which we would not use now, but were used to frame the way in which populations were measured. And counted and resources flowed from it. Um, so, uh, those who, uh, had less than 50% indigenous ancestry, uh, were counted as a non-indigenous person. Uh, those who had roughly equal ancestry were included in counts but counted separately, and those who had more than 50% ancestry, uh, were, uh, excluded from the count. Uh, and this was under the assumption that the indigenous population would essentially die off, uh, that the, the, any remnants of the indigenous population would be those with mixed ancestry, uh, and they would just, uh, assimilate into the overall population. Uh, I might come back to the, I think of these slides could be in slightly different order, uh, and I'll just jump back and forth a little bit, um. And that kind of process was essentially. Uh, driven by what had happened to the size of the indigenous population between colonisation and uh and federation. So this middle column gives the estimated size of the indigenous population as of the, the censuses which had been undertaken since Federation. And you can see from a population of about 800,000, give or take, down to under 100,000 or close to 70,000 in the early 1920s, uh, the, That trajectory was part of the rationale for treating the indigenous population separately and differently and unfairly, uh quite clearly in the in in data collection and our understanding of population size and demographics. Um, so, uh, these things interact. So the way we view populations, uh, and their trajectories affect how we count, and those counts affect how we, uh, design policy and target policy, uh, to those populations. So coming back to the 1967 referendum was not about voting, although it had relationship to voting in in certain ways in terms of uh electoral counts, but it was really about, uh, the power of government to make decisions about the indigenous population, uh, in the, um, uh, initial constitution, uh, or the Constitution of federation. Uh, the Commonwealth had no power to make laws for the indigenous population, and also, as mentioned, uh, this, um, uh, the section 127 was about, uh, reckoning the size of the population. So the constitutional referendum uh led to two things. It led to the Commonwealth government having power, but not having some power but not exclusive power to make laws on behalf of or for indigenous Australians, but it also meant that indigenous Australians then became part of the overall count in, uh, in the, um, from uh our data collection. Now without the first change, uh, the second change could have meant that we no longer asked questions about indigenous status in our data collection, because the reason why from 1901 or even prior to that from the colonial census is we were asking about indigenous status is to exclude. Uh so previously we asked, are you indigenous? If you said yes, fine, you're not on the counter. Uh, post 1967, that was not required, but the, so our reasoning for asking those questions changed. We asked the question post 1967 not to exclude, but to help target and design policy, ideally to improve the the circumstances of the indigenous population. We can judge as to how effective that was, uh, but that was the motivation. But you can see that uh here this gives the account uh these are not official estimates from here is when the ABS started making official estimates. These are just accounts, but you can see that even the counts started to increase quite substantially. Post 1967 referendum, and that makes perfect sense. Previously, you asked a question to exclude, now you asked the question to include and to help design policy and more people were willing and able to to answer that question. Um, so this takes it up to 2016, uh, just prior to the, to the, um, the 2021 figure which I gave before. Um, so why, why did the indigenous population grow from, uh, let's take our first estimate of 240,000 in 1986, up to, uh, a little under a million in 2021. One reason is natural increase, uh, so, uh, births minus deaths, uh, as well as births of indigenous children to indigenous fathers and non-indigenous mothers. Um, so, uh, if you have a population where the majority of children are identified. Uh, as being indigenous, regardless of whether their mother or father are indigenous, then, uh, the higher the rate is of partnering of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, the greater the, the rate of population growth. So have a thought exercise, you have two couples, uh, if one of the couples in indigenous and non-indigenous, sorry, two indigenous, uh, Um, males and females, another couple, non-indigenous males and females, their children would be identified as indigenous, these ones wouldn't. Now have another scenario where you have that indigenous male is partnered with a non-indigenous female and, Indigenous female with a non-indigenous male, uh, I think that's right, uh, then both of those sets of children would be identified as being indigenous, uh, not 100%, but for the most part. Um, so what that means is, is a situation where you have high rates of partnering between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, which we do see in, in the Australian context, uh, you have a more rapid growth in the population than would otherwise be the case. Uh, and also you have relatively high rates of fertility for indigenous females, uh, although there's been some convergence through time. Uh, you have people who previously, uh, uh, didn't identify as being indigenous and did in subsequent periods, uh, what demographers would call ethnic mobility. Uh, and then you have a slightly different version of that which is their own identification hasn't changed, but the way in which the data collection has changed, uh, and that could include reductions in people who didn't state their indigenous status. Um, so we have, uh, high rates of population growth, um, particularly post a referendum. Uh This is Just gives a a a kind of uh some demographic, um, it's a bit hard to see that actually on the screen, um, essentially the highest rates of growth are amongst younger Australians, particularly those under the age of 15, uh, and that kind of reflects that combination of high fertility rates, uh, uh, mixed partnering, uh, and the rest of the population growth is due to, to that identification change. OK, so, um, where are we up to, up to with our kind of very quick run through the, the indigenous population change. Um, we have, uh, a, a population, uh, close to a million, uh, probably much more than a million by now. Uh, we'll see in the 2026 census, uh, which is greater than the population as of colonisation. Uh, we have a, uh, a decline in that population from colonisation through to federation, uh, and then low, uh, population growth over the 1st 40 to 50 years of federation. Uh, uh, slightly higher growth rates up into the 60s and then a very rapid growth rate post 1967. Uh, and that population was, uh, changing due to, uh, both, um, natural increase, uh, sorry, demographic change, uh, as well as identification change. So that's the population, that's a really quick run through uh in uh um. Uh, uh, really quick run through the, the, the, the nature and and change of that, uh, as a population over the last, um, couple of 100 years. What do we know though about, let's segue a little bit, uh, and we'll relate these two again uh to um some economic measures and some measures of the indigenous economy. Um, so what we've seen over the last, um, uh, Um, 50 years or so is some fluctuations in indigenous employment outcomes, and employment is the main driver of economic circumstances for, um, not not only the indigenous population, but the whole, uh, the total population. So, uh, employment, uh, started off, Uh Relatively low compared to the non-indigenous population. Declined substantially into the early 2000s, and then since the early 2000s has slowly started to increase again, but still, the gap in employment outcomes between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians as of 2021, was not that different to what it was just after the constitutional. Uh, um, the, the, the referendum and the changes to the constitution. So 50 years of Commonwealth power to, uh, make policies targeting, uh, improvement in indigenous circumstances has led to, um, modest, uh, but, um. Somewhat underwhelming changes in economic circumstances. Yes.

SPEAKER 2
Is that related to the changing ideas about full employment?

SPEAKER 3
Yeah. Yeah, so there's, uh, a couple of drivers of this change. One is the changing nature of the Australian economy, um, so in the ear at, As our data collection started, uh, indigenous employment was concentrated in agriculture, manufacturing, uh, to, uh, industries which, uh, experienced substantial change over that period. Um, so, broader sec uh kind of economic change has impacted particularly on indigenous Australians, um. Changes to uh uh it um kind of macroeconomic measurement as well, uh and what we've found is that during times of recession, and some of these data collection was during times of recession, not only did overall employment decline, but indigenous employment declined more. Um, And uh some positive changes though, uh, especially in recent periods, uh, and we'll get to, um, kind of, uh, the role of identification change, but in more recent period, as the care economy has become uh more of a component of, uh, uh, overall Australian employment. Uh, because indigenous Australians have tended to have a slightly higher share of, um, uh, engagement in that care economy, it has had some benefits for the indigenous population. So, Structural change in the labour market initially had negative impacts, but more recently, if you think about uh education, delivery of education services, health services, other social services, indigenous Australians have benefited slightly from that, uh, uh, change. But what we've also had is another driver, uh, and, You really can't see that. Uh, so on here it looks, uh, you know, really clear, uh, but, uh, there is another line which essentially goes from here to here. So imagine it, uh, there's a lighter blue line, uh, it's in the slides on wattle. Uh, essentially what's happened is if you look at those who, whose identification didn't change. Uh, so that's that dark blue line over the last over the last 5 years or the the most recent 5 year period, uh, there was an improvement in employment outcomes. But if you include those who are newly identified as being indigenous, there was an even greater improvement in employment over the period. Or to put this another way, uh, this growth in employment between 2016 and 2021 is partly driven by improvements in employment for those who are identified as indigenous in 2016, but it's also driven by people who are. Changed your identification status and had better employment outcomes to start with. That's not saying that changing your identification leads to improvement in employment outcomes. There's no evidence for that in the data, uh, it doesn't support that hypothesis. What it is saying. is that when you have a changing identification patterns, you need to understand not only the outcomes of those who were in the population to start with, but also the relative outcomes of those who are entering that population. And on balance, those who uh changed to being identified as indigenous had better employment outcomes on average to start with, than those who were already identified as being indigenous. Uh, this was even greater, and again it's hard to see, this is the light blue line here. Um, this was even greater in the 2011 to 2016 period where all the improvement in employment was driven by identification change. So those who were indigenous in both periods, their employment actually worsened, um. So between 2016 and 2021, there was a more rapid improvement in employment, and it was also less driven by identification change and more by an improvement in the outcomes for the indigenous population. Um, let me just check. Uh, make sure we're we're going OK for time, um. Uh, so employment is a, is a core aspect of, uh, um, the indigenous economy. Um, but there are other aspects of the indigenous economy which are important in terms of, um, so if you think about education, uh, it's a measure of the human capital potential for the indigenous population. Uh, and, uh, other aspects like health outcomes, uh, housing, uh, are all aspects of the, uh, uh, the economy, uh, in the areas in which indigenous Australians live, as well as the, the share of that economy which indigenous Australians have access to. Um, so what we did, uh, in, or have been doing since going back to at least, no, I think, uh, we used the 2006 census was the first time we did it, but when we did it we also included the 2001 census data. So we've now got 5 censuses where we've been measuring the indigenous economy in local areas in Australia. Um, And Essentially we use about a geographic measure which has about 420 or so areas across Australia with roughly equivalent sizes for the uh indigenous population. We use 9 measures. I think there's 3 employment measures, 3 education measures, 2 housing measures, and 1 income measure, and what we do is we get a measure of the economic circumstances of the indigenous population in that area as well as the non-indigenous population in that area. And so to understand the change and the relative distribution in the indigenous population, uh, we can use this data to, to look at trends and patterns. Um, so what do we find? And I've got some data, uh, to, to expand on a couple of these points, but the key points are, uh, when we're thinking about the indigenous economy, um, there is a very wide distribution of socio-economic outcomes within the indigenous population. Uh, so the variation within the indigenous population is as large and sometimes larger than the variation within the total Australian economy, uh, or, or total Australian population. Or in certain circumstances, the differences or or in most circumstances, the differences between the most advantaged indigenous Australian and least advantaged is greater than the differences between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. So when thinking about the indigenous economy, we need to think about variation as much as we do about levels. Um, one source of that variation is that indigenous Australians in remote areas tend to have worse socio-economic outcomes than those in non-remote areas. But that's not exclusive. There are a number of highly disadvantaged urban areas. Uh, Western Sydney, for example, uh, the, it's become a little bit less the case, but when we first did this analysis, there were parts of Western Sydney which had socio-economic outcomes which were as bad as, uh, for the indigenous population as, uh, remote parts of the country. Uh, the distribution is stable through time, uh, at the area level, so areas which were relatively advantaged, stay advantaged, and those which were relatively disadvantaged stayed relatively disadvantaged. But there is some variation. Um, But a key point to make, and this and this kind of gets to some of the arguments we were making uh during the voice debate and trying to counter some narratives, is that in every area in Australia, the indigenous population has worse outcomes on average than the non-indigenous population. So it's not that indigenous Australians have worse outcomes because they live in remote areas. It is that in every area, there are worse outcomes for the indigenous compared to the non-indigenous population. The gaps between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians are largest in remote areas, but there are also a number of urban areas and regional areas in particular, where there are large divergences between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. So when you are thinking about the economy of particular regions, and I don't know how much you do on regional economics, uh, but, um, you know, there is no Australian economy, there's there's just a bunch of regional economies which have some interaction. Um, but when you are thinking about kind of the economies of particular areas or regions, uh, and the history and the change in those, um, the, the indigenous population has both different outcomes and different trajectories and different histories through time. Uh, and there are parts of the country, uh, which, uh, are doing relatively well where the indigenous population has relatively poor outcomes and vice versa. Um, and all this is, is kind of covered in a pub uh, publication, uh, uh, an ANU publication which we've got a link here. Um, so, Yeah, OK, so this is capturing the third point about stability. Um, so this is essentially the relative outcomes in 2016 compared to the relative outcomes in 2021 of the indigenous population. Uh, Dots to the left are advantaged in 2016, dots which are low, are advantaged in 2021. Dots to the right are disadvantaged in 2016, dots which are high are disadvantaged in 20. 11. And essentially what if it's on the line, then it hasn't changed at all in relative terms. If it's below the line, uh, it means it's worsened. If it's above the line, it means it's improved. So these are areas, 400 or so areas across Australia. red dots are. Remote areas, blue dots are non-remote areas. And you can see quite a fair bit of stability, but some variation. So this area got substantially worse, uh, sorry, this area got uh substantially better, I should have said. So if it's uh below the line it's become more advantaged, if it's above the line, it's become more disadvantaged. So this one's gotten substantially better, this one's got substantially worse, uh, you see some red dots, uh, towards the more advantaged areas. And some blue dots towards the more disadvantaged areas. Um, so change and churn and remote non-remote, a variation, but for the most part, advantaged in 2016 it's gonna be advantaged in 2021. There's stability, uh, both in advantage and disadvantage. Um And when we think about, come back to our employment question, uh, so these grey bars, you can see the, a bit hard to see the bars, but you can at least see the numbers. Um, remember we found, uh, that employment improved substantially between 2016 and 2021. But that only improved, so the grey bar is the 2021 figure that only improved outside of our most disadvantaged area. So remember I said there's variation within the indigenous indigenous population. Well over the last little while that variation has expanded, so. While there was improvement in the economic circumstances over the last 5 years, uh, it's been concentrated in areas which are relatively advantaged to start with. So I think this is my final slide. Happy to go to questions after that. Um, this is now comparing the indigenous population and area compared to the non-indigenous population. If the dog is on the line, then indigenous Australians have the same outcomes on average as non-indigenous Australians in the same area. If it's above the line. You can see all the ones above the line, uh, then the indigenous population has better outcomes than the non-indigenous population, and the further below the line, the larger the gap. So what this highlights is a couple of things. One is that there is of course a large gap in those areas. That gap varies, so in these areas it's it's relatively small, uh, in these ones it's relatively large, but the red dots tend to be, uh, further away from that line of equality. Um, so when we're thinking about the indigenous economy, when we're thinking about indigenous circumstances, a few things to keep in mind. Large variation, uh, and there is no single economy, uh, large gaps, but that gap varies. Uh, stability through time, uh, and a relative, uh, advantage in non-remote areas. And a widening in that diversity through time. And the final thing to remember, uh, to take away from this is, uh, coming back to this figure which you can't actually see, uh, is that the, this light blue line, which is the improvement of employment, taking into account identification change. And this dark blue line, which is the worsening employment over that particular period, uh if you if you uh exclude identification change. So Between 2016 and 2021, uh, similar, well, same direction in relativity, but much smaller gap, but, um, for both periods, a large proportion of the improvement in outcomes is driven by a changing population. So we need to understand population dynamics, to understand. Economic dynamics, uh, and, uh, that doesn't mean that identification change isn't legitimate and that newly identified indigenous Australians aren't in any way are are in any way less indigenous than those who previously identified, but it just complicates our understanding of economic change and economic circumstances. Um, so I'm gonna finish it there, uh, happy to take questions, um. There's a couple of links in the slides which expand on what I've covered, uh, and if I assume there's people listening to this online, uh, if you do have questions online, uh, for the recording, send me a quick email. I'm happy to answer those as well. But happy to open up to the people here and finish it off that the slides are at the moment.

SPEAKER 2
any questions I need to use it by this graph because I guess I'm surprised by how. Yeah. Yeah.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, so a couple of things. One is, is remoteness is a driver and, and, uh, those non-indigenous Australians who live in remote areas tend to be there for economic reasons, uh, fly in, fly out workers or working, uh, temporarily, uh, whereas for the indigenous population, it's a, it's country, it's, it's home. Um, 2 is that the, um, There are economic, um, the industrial, the, the industry distribution, uh, the, the economic structure in those areas in these areas tend to be relatively uh uh disadvantageous to the indigenous populations.
