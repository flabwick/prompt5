SPEAKER 1
To, uh, people, elders, and country. Um, are there, you've got your assignments coming up. I've had some queries on on um. Via email today, which is fine, I've answered those, uh, does anyone here have anything they'd like to raise about those, something, anything that was troubling them? Yeah, go ahead. That's right, I mean, I, I think that between the um, McLean and the weekly reading, you've probably got enough material there, but you shouldn't hesitate. If you want to draw on outside material, that's perfectly fine as well. So, um, yeah, uh, it's, it's not a research task, no. It's, it's a very early, almost diagnostic thing. We're just trying to test how you're going with your writing, with your comprehension, and those sorts of issues, yeah. But there's no prohibition on on bringing in outside stuff, yes. Yeah, you Yeah, you, you can define it. I mean, we use drivers advisedly. You, you can define it how you wish and, and make a case for that. So you, you could define it in terms of a particular commodity, you could define it in terms of a broader category, uh, a theme, uh, you know, so it's entirely, entirely up to you, as long as you can justify that, that's perfectly fine. Yeah. So if you wanted to, what was the category you said, um, natural resources or whatever. actually, if you, if you felt you could make a really good case that used a a pretty broad category like that, by all means, it's probably hard because I mean it's very broad, isn't it, natural resources, but it's perfectly fine to do it if you feel you can justify that, yeah, yep. Yeah. You'll probably have to speak up a little bit, I can, I could get the mic if that's so. To be Yeah, sure, and, and you can make it two parts if you like, stick a, you know, what they do a little star or an asterisk or something halfway through or subheading or something and just make it two parts like that, yeah, sure, sure, theme and a commodity or something, yeah, that's perfectly fine, yeah. Give it a little introduction. So give us a little bit at the right at the beginning that kind of tells the reader what the the scope of your piece is, brief, because you've only got 1200 words and a little conclusion at the end, but inside that you could do two sections that, you know, basically deal with two things like that, that would be fine. Yeah. Any uh sorry, anyone else? Was there another question up there? I'm not sure Yes. OK, so um again feel free obviously to drop me an email as, as people have been doing, but if anything occurs to you during the course of the lecture, uh, by all means, uh, let me know. Great, and Aldo, don't let um let me go, I've got something to give you, OK, so good. OK, so, um, urbanisation, gold, and industrialization, um, so let's let's get into that today. OK. There's an overview of where I want to take us today. I'm gonna look at gold and the impact of gold at the beginning. All again, pretty briefly, uh, expand on these in tutorials and through your reading. And I'm gonna look at rural diversification. So in some ways, an extension of last lecture on, on the rural economy. But here, moving beyond wool, to, to look at the impact of gold really on that process of a rural, you know, uh, Agricultural and pastoral development in the second half of the 19th century, the emergence of the family farm, but also looking at the relationship of that rural diversification to the formation of towns and cities. Um, so one of my themes, as you can see there. From part 4 is urbanisation. I want to look at the relationship between the hinterland and the cities, particularly those port cities, and uh, um, that, that inevitably involves a kind of a, a exploration of the relationship between rural industry. And, uh, uh, you know, the metropolis if you like, and just briefly, I'm, I'm a kind of a a a a not very deep dive into labour history to test out some of the ideas of Australia in terms of living standards and the, the sort of image of Australia as a workers' paradise that, um, you know, was sort of sitting there really from about the 1850s. OK, so, gold, let me begin, well actually let me begin on the eve of the gold rushes. Um, it, it was unclear, um, really whether Australia could sustain its high standard of living for its British population, mainly British population, um, at the middle of the 19th century, say in 1849 or 1850. Um, the capacity of an economy based largely on income from wool to continue growing was doubtful. Um, and this probably stimulated the search for an alternative source of wealth such as gold. I mean, one of the things that often happens, uh, in, uh, certainly happened in Australian history, and I think it's a pattern we find more broadly, is that when an economy reaches a difficult stage, there is often a search for alternatives and particularly mineral alternatives in Australian history, and we'll come across this again. In the 20th century, but that seems to have been um a process here that as the pastoral economy ran into difficult times, as I talked about last time in the depression of the 1840s, it probably stimulated a search for minerals and particularly for gold. Keeping in mind, of course, that gold was, was located, often in close proximity to pastoral stations and pastoral properties. Shepherds, for instance, were in a very good position. To, to explore uh land for for for potential mineral riches, so, um, there is probably a dynamic there, the best land though had already been taken up and wool was not a great, and this is gonna be one of my big themes today, wool wasn't a great employer of labour. OK, it didn't employ large amounts of labour, except in a very seasonal way, obviously during the shearing season it got busy, but at other times of the year, relatively limited labour supply focused very much on the shepherd, uh before the coming of fencing. Um, the political power of the pastoralists, squatters, as they were still sometimes called, was considerable. Um, but keep in mind they'd only been given long leases on their land, and I'll talk about that at a moment. They hadn't been given freehold, they hadn't been given outright ownership of their land, and this has really important implications when democracy arrives, cos it means that their control of the land is somewhat vulnerable. So, What I'm suggesting here is that without the discovery of gold, Australia would probably have grown only very slowly, um, after 1850. But between 1850 and 1890, as I'll suggest today, the Australian economy enjoyed a period of both prosperity and very rapid growth. Um, the growth rate was probably up around, um, 4.8%, so reaching up towards 5%, about 4, about 4.8% a year. Um, and stimulated by a whole range of changes that I'll talk about now. So let me begin with gold. Um, the, the discovery of gold, uh, by Europeans in Australia in middle of the 19th century is, uh, often credited to Edward Hammond Hargroves, um, but we know that there were earlier um discoveries even by Europeans in Australia, um. We also know of course that indigenous Australia had its own, um, what we might call a minerals industry and its own trading networks around certain types of minerals. So, um, uh, you know, the crediting of, of, of Hargraves in a way is a kind of piece of mythology. It's a bit like what I was talking about last week with the, the Blue Mountains, you know, kind of mythology of discovery was constructed around it, and I think that's the case here. This was in New South Wales near Bathurst, and of course. One thing that most of us would probably know about the Victorian, I just gave it away, didn't I, about the Australian gold rushes is that it was really in Victoria that they came into their own. These were where the, the richest, uh, fields were, the very famous gold fields of Castlemaine, uh, of, of Sandhurst, which became Bendigo, of, of Ballarat. Um, these were immensely rich gold fields. Very important to keep in mind too that there is a kind of transnational global history. Shortly before the Victorian gold rushes there had of course been or had been a gold rush in the west of the United States, in California. OK, so important to keep that in mind. Some of those, uh, who came to, to, uh, dig for gold in eastern. Australia were, uh, experienced in that gold rush. They'd migrated to, to, to California to dig there and they moved on. And so there was a bit of a trail. Sometimes you had miners who would go from rush to rush, travelling across the world in the process. And I think that should register for you that maritime transport is becoming much easier and quicker and. Cheaper. And I'm going to talk about that very briefly in a moment. There's a, a very, um, familiar sort of image of the Victorian goldfields, ST Gill, um, uh, an artist, you know, a name, a name, uh, very much associated with, uh, depictions of, uh, the Victorian gold fields. And, uh, there you have, um, a, a very typical sort of ST Gill, um, painting. So transport, now. This is truly a remarkable, a remarkable development. Think back to week one. First Fleet, how long? Do you remember? Even more, I think it was about 8 months, 8 to 9 months, somewhere around there. OK, look at that, that's without steam. OK, that's a record. OK, so that's unusual to do it that quickly, but the Red Jacket, Liverpool to Sydney, 69 days in 1854. These were called clipper ships. They were fast. Uh, they, by this stage, of course, discovered all the best routes for getting the, the, uh, you know, strong winds, um, 69 days. So, maritime transport is becoming, uh, they're smaller ships too than the older ones, so it's becoming quick. It's becoming safer, um, I mean we're not talking about international jet travel here but uh you know, to, to travel from, Uh, Great Britain to Australia in 69 days is a stark contrast with what we were talking about in that first week. So, if you want a sense of why there's a kind of acceleration going on in terms of the numbers of migrants, in terms of the transfers of ideas of goods, all of those sorts of things in the middle of the 19th century, this is a part of the story. It's about the rise of the clipper ship. And, uh, you know, it's a very effective form of, uh, transport. Now steam is also beginning to come in, steam would be of more significance in the second half of the 19th century, but even then, they tended to use sail most of the time. So typically, uh, a ship would, would have sail and steam, and they'd only use the steam when the wind stopped blowing. OK, so a lot of the, the, the transport in maritime, uh sorry, the revolution in maritime transport that is associated with the gold rushes in Australia and the mass migration of that period is really driven by by by wind, by. Those old kind of, uh, sources of power and not the newer ones. OK? So very important, I think, to keep that in mind. But you can see that the dramatic contrast of a, you know, in this case, a journey of, of not much more than 2 months. OK, not much more. Now, more typically 3 months, sometimes even getting towards 4, but that's how quick it could be by the time we get to the gold rush period. And look at the the populations we're talking about here. Um, so Melbourne's white settler populations is basically the British population of Melbourne, which had been founded by, uh, um, colonisers coming across Bass Strait from, from, uh, Van Diemen's Land from Tasmania. Only in, in the mid 1830s, so in 1835. By 1851, it has 23,000 people. So I don't know, you put that in perspective now that's what, the, the, the population of, say, Goulburn I suppose, something like that. That's the size of Melbourne. So it was already, you know, a, a substantial town, but still a pretty small one on the whole, 10 years later, look at it. 125,000. Now, by the standards of the, the, the mid-19th century, that's a substantial sized city, and that's really at a still quite early stage, uh, in the gold rush period, that's after about a decade of the gold rushes, but look at the hinterlands. Look at the total population of Victoria, so in other words, you've got over 400,000 people in all those gold fields in other towns, in, in emerging agricultural towns, but particularly in those big inland provincial towns. This is one of the periods, in some ways one of the rare periods in Australia where you have a really substantial inland population. OK, and I'm talking here again about the, obviously the colonising population. OK, that the trend would increasingly be towards concentration of people within the metro the metropolis, within the, the, the, the colonial capital, but in this period, Victoria especially has hundreds of thousands of people living in the hinterland because of the gold rushes. So, and then, you know, look, compare, um, uh, the situation there, uh, Melbourne to Sydney. Melbourne has, in the space of just a few years, overtaken Sydney in size. Sydney that's been there since 1788. And that would continue to be the case, uh, really until the 1890s. Melbourne was the largest city in Australia through that period, and indeed one of the largest cities in, in the British Empire, um, in, in the second half of the 19th century, when it, And, and you can still see that, I mean, those of you who know Melbourne well, who, who comes from Melbourne or knows well, I mean you can still see it in, in the cityscape, you can see all those buildings from the 1860s, 1970s, 1980s that reflects the wealth of Melbourne, uh, uh, the Parliament House, uh, primary amongst them up up in uh Spring Street, of course, but many others as well. So that's what's happening. Um, gold is, is significant because of the richness, I mean it's significant for a range of reasons. Um, it, it was the lubricant of trade in the 19th century. OK, this is a period when banknotes are still regarded with suspicion. International trade is fundamentally conducted with, with gold, um, or with bits of paper that are backed by gold, that are reliably backed by gold. So in a lot of ways, you know, you can think of gold as having a kind of significance in the 19th century as oil would have about a century later to the international economy, and which I suppose what microchips today? OK, that's the kind of significance that gold has. This is the period of the gold standard. It's the period when Britain um had adopted a system that basically guaranteed the exchange of pound sterling for gold. OK, and this was a way of ensuring reliability of currency stability of a flow, uh uh uh uh an easy flow of global trade, OK, and, you know, the, the gold standard would have a chequered history, which we'll talk more about in later lectures, but it's very important to to keep in mind that the currencies are backed by gold in this period, that makes gold a very important um uh commodity. So that's one reason why it's immensely important, OK, and, and, and, uh, you know, basically Southeastern Australia was providing about a third of the world's gold supply in the 1850s, so really important aspect, but, It's important for other reasons too, it's not just important in terms of a staple. Do you remember our discussion of staples? It's not just important because it, it's an export staple, and it was the dominant export staple for for 20 years between about 1851 and 1871. It's the most valuable, uh, export commodity till it's overtaken by wool again, but it matters for this reason, because of the richness of the linkages. Backward linkages, especially they're called, in the case of gold. Look at all those inputs that you needed in order to sustain a gold industry. And keep in mind we're talking here mainly about quite small scale enterprises. This is not in certainly the first half of the 1850s, and indeed much of the 1850s, we're still talking about essentially individual miners, individual diggers rather than large companies. Sometimes 2 would work together, sometimes 4 would work together. This isn't really the age of company mining, OK? Especially the alluvial period, the, the more easily won gold was mined, uh, by individuals or very small groups. It was only really with the development of quartz mining, where the, where the quartz had to be crushed and the gold taken from the, the quartz from the stone. That you get uh the rise of of company mining, OK, where, where you need um heavier investments of capital, or deeper alluvial leads, so still kind of alluvial mining in the underground creeks, where it's harder to get at, and so then you had the, the arrival of company mining, but we're talking about, Quite small scale claims by individuals or very small groups of people through the early part of the gold rush, but look at the inputs that you needed, timber you needed in order to mining machinery, you know, pretty rudimentary, but someone needed to make it. You needed enterprises that could make it. Obviously clothing, most of this is intuitive, isn't it, clothing, food and agriculture. Uh, a big thing was the slaughtering of, um, livestock, so one of the problems that the wool growers had not surprisingly, is all their workers ran away. OK, so their workers tended to run away, uh, to the gold fields, uh, so what did they do next? Well, they did a few things, greater reliance on indigenous labour, on Aboriginal labour. So there is clear evidence in the 1850s, significant numbers of koori of of Victorian Aboriginal, uh, people, uh, essentially going into the pastoral industry and being relied on. In fact, I, I was going to read out to you which I will do. Again apologies for the archaic and offensive language, um, but this, this is, um, a, uh, an official, uh, a kind of um government official talking about the impact of the gold rushes on, on the pastoral industry, and this is what he said, um. His name was Joseph Anderson Panton. Mangalore was a great place of call for squatters travelling up and down the country, scarcely a day passed without one or two visitors. Most of these men being pioneers, it was most interesting to hear their yarns. When the manager left, I found myself in charge of the station. I had an overseer named Fay to assist me and sadly I wanted assistance, as most of the men had abandoned their sheep, and the flocks were left to the mercy of the wild dogs, OK, so they've all run off to the gold fields, right? I had to requisition the services of the blacks. The overseer and I were at different points in the run all day, riding in the forest, collecting and driving together small flocks of sheep. The end was we had to box the sheep and put them in charge of the black fellows and lures, which is an offensive term now for um female indigenous people. A married couple I had as servants cleared out, and for the time a black fellow and his wife, the so-called chief of the tribe, looked after the whole station during my absence, and so on. So you can see here that the drawing on on indigenous labour on on on Aboriginal labour, um, in, in the context of the early gold rush where workers have run off. The other thing that the partialist turned to in the medium term is fencing. OK, they invest in fencing. One of the problems with that of course is that it means they run up debts. Fencing extensive property in Australia is very expensive. OK, so they become much more indebted to banks and other institutions in the process, but it does reduce their dependence on on labour, obviously, you you need fewer shepherds if you've got fencing. OK, so that's another way in which the, the, the thing responds. But the other thing the pastoralists do is they slaughter, particularly in the early days, they slaughter their livestock. So sheep that had been used for wool would be slaughtered and used for food, uh, because, uh, um, it, it attracted good prices on the gold fields. There was a heavy demand for meat on the gold fields, and so, uh, there was a, a widespread, uh, slaughter of of livestock. Um, fence building I've mentioned, um, they need, they need housing, even though they're mainly living in tents in the, in the early years, but you know, there's demand for housing in provincial towns like Ballarat, Bendigo, Sandhurst, and, and indeed in Melbourne itself. They need tools, boots, candles, soap, harnesses, and of course shipping. OK, all of this is important. The Victorian gold rush has given an enormous boost to the South Australian economy. OK, the South Australian economy has sort of been bubbling along, not terribly successfully in the early years. Again, it's found at about the same time as Melbourne, 1836, compared with Melbourne's 1835. It's a essentially a, a kind of private public partnership to found South Australia. Um, there's a big land grab, um, mainly sheep, but, um, there's also, uh, a, you know, the beginnings of agriculture. And South Australians do well selling both um livestock, as well as grain, as food, essentially um that this is the beginnings of a significant wheat industry um in in South Australia. So, um, you know, South Australia's quite proximate to the, the Victorian gold fields, wasn't a long way away, it was relatively easy to transport goods across, they could do it by by shipping. Um, and, and they could send the goods through Melbourne or, or Geelong, OK, from, from South Australia, so. Um Linkages, so really important. One of the really, really significant linkages is, uh, the engineering industry. Even today you can go into a town such as Castlemaine, quite a, it's still quite a small, the trend is have well and truly overtaken Castle. It's, it's, you know, so it's a place for artists and writers and all the rest of it these days, um, you know, full of lovely cafes and restaurants and all the rest of it. But move beyond the main street and you'll see great big buildings, Thompson's works, these were engineering works that emerged out of the gold rushes, OK, to provide, Um, uh, equipment that was needed for the gold industry in a very rich field, which Castlemaine was, OK, so you find a similar patterns in Ballarat and elsewhere, the development of significant engineering work. So eventually Ballarat, there was a foundry called Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat that produced, The Victorian government's engines for the railways, you know, very sophisticated forms of manufacture. OK, so that's one of the key linkages. It gives an enormous stimulus to engineering because it draws in skilled labour and and capital investment into those factories in places like Bendigo, Ballarat and Castlemaine. I mean to take, I, I'll come to this later, but HV Mackay uh Agricultural Works begins in Ballarat. OK, begins in Ballarat, even though it ends up in Melbourne. Um, the way in which gold was, the gold industry, if you like, was organised was, was via a licencing system. The rates changed over the years, but basically to, to dig for gold you needed to take out a licence. It was effectively a form of tax. This is a monthly licence, um, and you can see there the amount, it's 30 shillings, 1 pound 10 shillings, 30s, quite a lot of money, OK, and, and the licence became a grievance. So basically, the, the, the government said that gold belongs to the crown. And if you want the right to extract it, you've gotta pay for it, you've got to pay a tax to take it out of the, out of the out of the ground, OK? Now this became a um a grievance that the um licence system became a grievance, there was um substantial corruption. In the way it was administered on the gold fields, uh, it was expensive, and if you were unlucky in a particular month, it meant that you basically came out behind, so you couldn't be certain that, that, um, you know, you were gonna make enough to actually to be able to live. And of course, you know, the longer they're there, the more difficult it becomes to obtain the gold, and the, the, um, business historian Geoffrey Blainey many years ago made the point that at Ballarat, by the time you get to about 1854, the leads are very deep. OK, the leads are very deep becoming very hard to get gold. If there was a licence hunt, if the officials came around to inspect people's licences, they'd stand at the top of the mine shafts and, you know, uh, the diggers were long, long, long way down. They'd have to come up, took ages, they'd have to show their licences, then they'd have to go back down. Um, the time wasted was becoming problematic causes the less time you spent digging, of course, the less gold you were going to get. In in mineshafts where it was becoming harder to get gold anyway, OK, so you can see the way in which a kind of sense of grievance and resentment was building up. Goldfield's radicalism was strongest really initially at Bendigo, at Sandhurst, but it was at Ballarat, an outbreak occurred in November, December 1854. There were a number of triggers for it, and gold the corruption of Goldfield's administration was certainly one of them, and you had an uprising on the, well, basically at the end of November, they formed a stockade, a kind of a a. a rough enclosure, um, the, the miners, they armed themselves, and, uh, after a few days, the soldiers, uh, made an attack on the morning of the 3rd of December 1854, killing about 30, um, uh, miners. Uh, I think one wife was killed because there were women and children in the stockade as well. About 4 or 5 of the soldiers were killed. It, it was, and A violent episode in Australian history, Australia's European history, elevated again given a mythological status. OK, so while, you know, historians ignored settler violence on the frontier against indigenous people, they elevated this into a kind of a, a part of a radical tradition. Um, some called it the birth of Australian democracy. The major account was produced by an Italian called Raffaello Caboni, who was, um, uh, a digger and, and very much involved in the, uh, um, the movement, the digger movement, and in 1855 he produced the, the foundational account really of the Eureka Stockade, uh, uprising, a book that I think is still in print these days. So, um, Uh, one of the outcomes of this was a, um, a reformed licencing system. The Victorian government introduced what was called a miner's right. You paid £1 and you could dig for gold for a year. This was done after a royal commission. It also had a vote attached to it. It also had a vote attached to it, so you also had a situation in which, having taken out the right to dig for gold, you had a you also had a vote for the legislative council of the day. OK, and, and this is significant because it it augments the political power of recent migrants and particularly those on, on the gold fields. OK, let me move on. Um Here is a broad summary of the growth of the, the settler population of the Australian colonies during this period, and you can see there, 1851, beginning of the gold rushes, fewer than half a million across the whole of the continent. By the time we get to 1861, this is becoming a substantial set of British colonies. You can see there, 1,145,585 is the calculation for for 1861. OK, uh, always keep in mind much of the country, once you get beyond the very settled southeast, is still indigenous country, it's still Aboriginal country, as as Boyd reminded us in that first lecture. So here I'm talking about a European economy and a European population. Gold mining, like pastoralism, did displace indigenous people, although on the whole, pastoralism came first. OK, so pastoralism tended to come first. The violence was generally associated with the coming of sheep. OK, um, diggers gold came later, but there is still displacement of indigenous people as a result of the spread of gold fields in southeastern Australia. Chinese miners are a factor here too, OK? By the time we get to about the late 1850s, and they are a really significant portion of, uh, the Victorian population in particular. OK, they're about, I think, 1 in 8 Victorians. OK, uh, so this is, I guess the, the beginnings of a really substantial engagement between the Australian colonies in Asia. There had been earlier migrants into the pastoral industry, um, so there were were certainly Chinese employees in the pastoral industry, but this is, this occurs on a much grander, a much larger scale. And governments and diggers don't like it. There are violent episodes at a number of sites, and governments move to legislate to stem the flow of Chinese uh miners coming into the country by imposing discriminatory taxation, poll taxes as they were called, by limiting the number of uh Chinese who could come in on any ship. OK, a whole range of restrictions of that kind, in many ways it's the beginning of the White Australia policy, OK, in in the 1850s. But, but Chinese were very successful, miners on the whole, it's an overwhelmingly male population. And uh a population that would form the foundation for various forms of enterprise and industry among Chinese in the second half of the 19th century. Obviously gold mining but also market gardening was, was, was very common. um, and, and indeed there a Chinese merchant class develops in, in the major cities in Melbourne and, and Sydney as well, who take leadership really of that community. So very important demographic moment to the gold rushes. And there's a, a kind of, again, a kind of legendary sort of uh image, a kind of, uh, you know, part of the iconography, the sort of manly digger by Julian Ashton, painting much later than the the gold rushes in 1889. Let me turn to, as I said, what's happening in rural industry during this period, and I won't go into all this in detail, but the important thing to really take out of this, Is that there's a battle going on in the 1830s and 1840s over security of tenure, Pastoralists, those squatters who'd occupied land outside the limits of location, really unlawfully wanted greater security, and governments from about 183. are prepared to give it to them. Initially under licence, um, you know, kind of a, a, a licence to graze stock, and then a more substantial leasehold system that's introduced in after a great battle between the governor of the day and the squatters, it's introduced in 1847. Now for the economic history of when I learned about this at school, this was often represented the great victory of the squatters. They got security of tenure in 1847. Now you'll notice in Ian McLean's book, and a lot of economic historians have pointed this out, it was only a half victory because it's leasehold. They are vulnerable. What happens when their leases run out? Are they gonna be able to maintain control of the land? And of course the problem for them is that you have this huge influx of population from 1850, 1851 onwards associated with gold, as well as the coming of democracy. That combination is a potent one in basically wresting control of land from squatters, because there is a movement to unlock the lands. That's very much associated with the digger movement. These are gold diggers who want basically want access to the land, as the gold's running out, and selection was a movement that, you know, essentially aimed to to wrest control of at least some of the land from the old pastoralist class, the grazier class, and place it with smaller farmers. And there's legislation from about 1860 onwards, passed by the. Various colonies that is essentially designed to unlock the lands and to provide opportunities for small farmers. Now that couldn't have happened if that land had been under freehold. It was possible because of the leasehold system. I won't go into the ways in which squatters squatters were able to, yes. They did, yes. Oh very much so, yes, if squatters had enough property to qualify to vote, miners would not have had enough property to qualify to vote before 1855. Once the miner's right is introduced at 1 pound a year, they, they have that right. They could waive their miner's right, and that's, that allows them to vote. Still have, they still had enough Yeah, they, they, by then they, they'd have enough property to, to qualify to, to, to be able to vote, yeah. And not only vote, but I mean, they also tended to be able to influence the the votes of others because of their economic power. OK, so in many cases, squatters had taken up some freehold land. They'd taken up some freehold land, but remember they're not illegal by the time we get to about 1836. By 1836, firstly they operate under kind of an annual licence, and then from 1847, they're operating under leasehold. So their their leasehold has a value that will qualify them to vote and of course they exercise power well beyond the capacity to vote. Yeah, yeah. So Yep. Uh, yeah, that's a good, a very, very good question. The issue of whether Chinese qualified to vote was very contentious through this era, because remember a lot of Chinese in Australia were British subjects. I mean they'd come from, uh, Hong Kong for instance. OK, so, um. Yeah, there's a whole argument goes through the 1860s and the 1870s about whether Chinese settlers in Australia could could vote, and there's much, much evidence of Chinese voting at a whole range of elections, um, but yeah, it's constantly being debated, there are occasional attempts, a disenfranchisement of Chinese, but we have lots of, I mean I talked about this in the book I wrote, the, the Dreamers and schemers, there's lots of evidence of Chinese voting. Yeah, yeah. And, and, and for different types of, of authority to local government, mining boards, um, uh, as well as parliamentary elections. Indeed, it got, it really got to a point where, you know, opponents of Chinese migration were complaining about Chinese political influence. I mean. Complete fiction, but we're saying, oh, you know, Chinese are controlling elections, this sort of stuff, or they're able to determine the the results of elections, utter nonsense, but Chinese voting was sufficiently conspicuous to make it plausible to to people who weren't thinking very much, yeah. So, there you, you've got the, the selection legislation. A lot of the early legislation's not very good. Victorian legislation um was easy to evade, particularly, but it gets better, and that's very important because that provides a foundation for rural diversification. OK, as the legislation gets better, as it's easier for people to settle, um, there's a kind of winnowing out too, of. Successful farmers whose land would be taken over by more successful ones, so farms would be merged, bigger units would be created, they're more successful, and one of the results of that is the emergence of the Australian family farm as a really significant economic unit. That kind of hangs in there even today, doesn't it? The great difficulty, but it's, it's, it's still, you know, an important unit today, but immense importance in the second half of the 19th century and deep into the 20th would have politically and economically transformative effects. Um, so again, I won't go into this in great detail, but, um, the, the, the intention behind selection was it would be about agriculture, it would be about cropping, it would be people growing things rather than simply grazing. Now the reality of course is that Australian land is really good for grazing. You can make lots of money out of grazing. Um, and, and what tended to happen, particularly as those farms got a bit bigger, is that people would mix and match. So they'd use some of their farm, maybe, you know, it might be 1000 acres they might use for for growing corn or wheat or something, or oats, and another part of it they'd use for wool growing or perhaps to run beef cattle or whatever. So you, you have mixed farming emerges as an aspect of family farming as well. So the intention. Uh, of developing agriculture certainly happens, but, um, there's also a lot of grazing, um, happens on those, those relatively small and medium sized farms. But you do have the development of a commercial wheat industry in Australia in the second half of the 19th century. South Australia, as I've already hinted, becomes a leading wheat growing colonies, a big market over in Victoria for South Australian wheat. Uh, unfortunately they pushed too far north, uh, there was this ridiculous notion that you could basically, if you, if you farmed land, that the rain would somehow follow the plough. And of course it looked great during good seasons and then bang, there was a shocker of a season and uh essentially uh a retreat by the farmers, a southward retreat by the farmers in South Australia. um Goyder was a surveyor who basically said, he reckon that, You could do successful farming up to a certain line, he was right, he was basically right, because when they went beyond it, they found that it was unsustainable. But you can see there, you know, um, the development of wheat farming in South Australia, Victoria, as as the selection legislation gets better, you have the development of. Wheat farming there in the early 20th century, New South Wales becomes, uh, the country's leading wheat producer, the wheat belt, as it's called in New South Wales, again, politically and economically important, was one of the mainstays of the labour Party actually for many years, very oddly. A lot of small wheat farmers supported labour and Western Australia from the 1890s onwards develops a wheat belt. OK, so I've talked about that. So there's some examples of rural diversification, uh, Uh, the development of wool continues to develop, wool continues to develop, and it develops very rapidly in the later half, uh, sorry, the latter part of the 19th century. It expands westward, it expands into western Queensland with often devastating consequences for indigenous people, some of the worst violence, uh, of the Australian frontier occurs along those, those Queensland frontiers of, of the 1860s and 1870s. Uh, often Victorians. Taking up land in western Queensland, um, and yeah, so massive, uh, um, really overproduction, uh, of wool in Australia in the late 19th century, and there's a correction in the 1890s depression. Wheat, um, the development of wheat I've talked about, um, the development of, of strains of wheat that were suited to the thin, uh, Australian soils and the dry climate, famously a Federation wheat which is developed just near here in Canberra. Um Meat develops as a as an export initially, so this is to do with shipping, uh you get uh refrigeration on, on international shipping. Initially Australia's too far away uh for for simply chilled meat, it had to be frozen, and that made Australian meat less competitive than, say, South American wheat in terms of getting it to the European market, but nonetheless, um, frozen meat exports are taking off in the 1880s. Dairy is, is very strong, uh, in Victoria, but also in other coastal areas of eastern Australia. And even rabbiting, so rabbits have been introduced for initially for hunters, they become a pest and start destroying the land, um, but they also become an industry, so you could make money from, from, um, both the skins and the meat. And a huge industry developed actually around the rabbits. So what had begun as fun and leisure and then became a pest, eventually becomes a kind of industry as well as a pest. Uh, I won't lab that. Sunshine harvester, really interesting. I mean this is a, a very sophisticated, um, stripper harvester that, that, um, is produced in Australia, it's competitive with, uh, the American imports, indeed it's uh it's exported, but you know, it develops initially in Ballarat. OK. That is not coincidental. It's to do with what I was saying earlier about those linkages between gold and, uh, engineering. So you've got the skills, they can turn, uh, their, their skills to the production of agricultural machinery, and eventually it did move to, to what's now the, the suburb of Sunshine in, uh, in Melbourne. Um, but that, that's a very good example of the ways in which gold had acted as a stimulus for certain types of industry. One of the ways in which, and I've talked more about this in my political history, of course, but one of the ways in which the Victorians try to keep their population, that goldfields population as the gold is running out, is through establishing industry, through establishing manufacturing, and they try to do it, again it's all very topical, behind a tariff wall. OK, they, they introduced a a tariff in the mid 1860s, and this becomes a mark of Victorian politics, the use of the tariff to foster native industry. It becomes central to the politics of Victoria. New South Wales, on the other hand, tended to, um, cling to free trade. OK, it was a a a a a major port and the idea there was that uh goods would be kept cheaper in Sydney, New South Wales, if you, you didn't have taxes on goods. Uh, Victoria therefore became the centre of Australian manufacturing. I mean it's very important to keep in mind Victoria. Melbourne, centre of manufacturing right through this period deep into the 20th century, and also the centre of finance. I mean, Sydney is clearly the major centre of finance in Australia today, but not through most of Australia's history. It was Melbourne, and that again was associated with gold. It was the you need banks for gold. You need banks and you need insurance, you need a whole range of those kinds of services. I won't go into that in great detail. I will just mention that. So I'm up to the, the sort of workers' paradise concept here and, Australia did, as, as you know, you, you'll be reading in McLean, uh, did develop living standards for its British population, were very high by the standards, some, some would argue actually, uh, it was, it was the richest country in the world in terms of living standards in the second half of the 19th century, certainly through to 1890, um, but it's, it's important to keep in mind some of the, Limitations on that too, OK, uh, and there they are. Much of the labour was seasonal, so I, I've already hinted at this, uh, you know, the, the shearing, the, the wool industry needed a lot of shearers at shearing time, which in southeastern Australia was about October, OK, about September through to November. But at other times of the year, particularly once they've got fencing, it's not a labour intensive industry, so there's only a brief period where you need lots of workers. The same with the wheat industry. OK, the harvest in southeastern Australia is basically November, stretching into December. You need lots and lots of workers at that point, but not at other times of the year, OK? And, and this extended right through the economy. There were whole sections of the economy where it was very seasonal. Wharf labour was very seasonal because, you know, very busy on the wharves when the exports are flowing, but not so much at other times of the year. OK, so it has a strong seasonal aspect, there are strong differences between male and female experience of work, which I'll talk about in a moment. I've already given some hints of the differences between the experience of Aboriginal workers and white workers, of Chinese workers. Uh, Aboriginal workers do become a factor. In some parts of the economy, notably the northern, um, pastoral industry, very significant, but they're also drawn into agricultural labour, they're drawn into pastoral labour according to demand. So there's interesting work on South Australia, but during labour shortages in particular, um, there was much greater participation by Aboriginal men in South Australia in the wheat industry there, yeah. Yeah, so the ration system's very strong, uh, in the northern in northern Australia where it's not a wage economy. OK, so yes, often paid in in rations, there's, uh, a tendency on, I mean, Aboriginal people are essentially combining work in the cattle industry with the maintenance of traditional lifestyles on the cattle stations basically is very common in northern Australia. In the South, uh, a wage economy is much more prevalent. OK, uh, we don't really know, to be perfectly honest, what people are being paid in industries like agriculture. That's probably true for the most part of white workers too, because it's very unregulated in the 19th century, but it's almost certain that the cash is being used to pay indigenous workers, say, if they go in and do the harvest in South Australia in the 1870s, yeah. So race, um skills very important, different levels of skill. There was a concept of the aristocracy of labour, OK, where skilled workers would be paid quite significant amounts. A good example would be typographers in the printing industry. Uh, a train driver is a was a highly skilled form of work, OK, so they would attract much more, much higher wages than say someone doing uh shearing or mining. Uh, who in turn would attract higher wages than someone doing carting or delivering or working in a boot factory or a clothing factory. OK, so you have a, a really quite strong hierarchy amongst workers in terms particularly of, of skill, OK? And there were always arguments and debates about what was and was not skilled worker. We're sheer. At work was shearing skilled work? Well, in some ways it was, but it didn't require a long apprenticeship. It did require some training, but not a long apprenticeship, so there was a tendency to regard shearing as semi-skilled rather than fully skilled work with a, you know, wages set accordingly. The differences between white collar and blue-collar worker uh work quite important to the clerk. OK, a lot of, there's a a a big demand for skilled clerical work in Australia and indeed right through the British Empire in the 19th century. The.
