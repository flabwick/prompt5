SPEAKER 1
Right, 5 past, so are you happy for me to ready to start? OK, well, look, um, welcome everyone, and I'll begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we're meeting the Nunnawal and Namburi and pay my respects to elders, people and country. If I look a bit flustered, it's because I've been pestered by media all afternoon about the federal coalition, a topic about which I don't actually know very much, so don't, if you hear any me on radio, pay absolutely no attention to it. Um, OK, but with great pleasure, um, to introduce Doctor John Hawkins. Uh, John, uh, teaches at the University of Canberra. He's based, based over there, but has had a rich career, uh, in Reserve Bank of Australia, in Treasury, so in, in many respects, the topic that, um, John's talking about today will also be from the pers his perspective as a practitioner as well as a leading Australian economic historian. Um, John has contributed to this course. In fact, my favourite contribution, John, I have to say, was during COVID. John was actually kind enough to come around to the house and the lecture was done from, I think, our kitchen table back in 2022. So it's 2020. So, John has been a wonderful contributor, and I'm very grateful. The expertise and experience that, that, that John has brought to the course. So without further ado, over to you, John. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Frank.

SPEAKER 2
As, as Frank said, I've, uh, been given a lecture like this for a while now, uh, to the extent that some of the things that were contemporary events are now, uh, subsumed into history, like, uh, COVID. So, uh, Frank told you a bit about my career, so I started at, uh, Reserve Bank. I've also worked at, uh, Treasury. Uh, also meant the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of International Settlements, and also I was secretary of the Senate Economics Committee. And, uh, when we get to the Q&A at the end of the, uh, presentation, I'm very happy for you to ask questions about working in any of those organisations, or, or chat to me after the talks for that matter. So I'm starting from around about 2000, and I'd imagine for many of your parents, the highlight of 2000 was your birth, but for a lot of the rest of Australia, the highlight was the Sydney Olympics. But I'm, I'm gonna be mainly talking about, uh, the, and, you know, if you, year 2000 was the first time Murd on the Dance Floor was a hit, and it was the time when Marvel superheroes were a new phenomenon in the film world. But economically, Australian economy is doing pretty well. So inflation was 2%, which seemed pretty good compared to what we'd seen in the 20 or 30 years before that. We had a budget surplus, uh, something that you don't see very often in Australia. Unemployment was a bit high at 7%, but that was uh coming down, it had been in over 10% in the early 1990s. So, so things were pretty good. We uh introduced the GST and some people would say that was the last time we had a significant uh macroeconomic reform in Australia. I'm not in a microphones. So Australia was, I think, particularly with the Olympics, which, against all predictions, even the public transport in Sydney was able to handle, and it went well, and so Australia I think was, was facing the future with uh confidence, maybe verging on hubris. Uh, a major trading partner in 2000 was Japan as it had been for a few decades, but that was changing. Uh, China was emerging into the global economy, or, or re-emerging if you take a long view of history. So the communists had come to power in 1949, and surprisingly, given the, the virulence of the anti-communist rhetoric in the 1950s and 1960s in Australia, uh, we were making wheat deals uh with China from the late 1950s. But China at this stage was still a very poor country and a very isolated uh uh country. But, uh, we were one of the early countries to give them diplomatic recognition, uh, Whitlam meeting Mao in that picture there in 1972. And by the time Deng Xiaoping comes to power, China opens up and starts to grow at a a phenomenal rate. So to, to put this into some longer term perspective. You go back to the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom. And it took 86 years for the average person's income to double from the equivalent of about $3000 today to $6000 today. So you're talking about real poverty to a still very modest level of income, but. Yeah, it, it doubled and it took 86 years. Now it's much easier to follow someone than to, to be the leader. So, adopting some of the same technologies, the steam engine and that sort of stuff. Germany in the second half of the 19th century, achieved the same increase from 3000 to 6000 in only 47 years, so much quicker. By comparison, China did the same thing in 11 years. So it Given the size of the Chinese economy too, it was the, the greatest period in history of people being lifting out of gross poverty. And from Australia's point of view, it was the emergence of a huge market and also a huge source of manufactured goods. So Australia and China were almost ideally set up to be complementary. So Australia could provide iron ore and coal to fuel the manufacturing in China, and we could help educate their students. Talking my book a bit here. And in return, China could provide us with manufactured goods. So they had then um very cheap labour, which Australia certainly didn't have at that time. And both countries could provide tourist speeches for each other, so there was a lot of scope for trade, and over time, a lot of trade happened. So see here. China becomes around about 2 after 2000 they become overtake Japan, become our largest trading partner, largest destination for uh exports, and that's continued to be the case, uh, ever, ever since. So This, this great conditions that the Australian economy was having in the early part of this century have been labelled the China boom, because that was probably the single largest factor behind it. We also saw a big improvement in the terms of trade after 2000. So this is a long run chart of the terms of trade, and you can see that over the, the 20th century of 1900 to 2000, there was a sort of downward trend in Australia's terms of trade. And at the time, A lot of people thought that was sort of inevitable, uh, that, uh, we export basic commodities and we import manufacturers, and over time, that means the terms of trade would move against us. Now, of course, there's sort of doubt about that because there's been this huge increase. So our terms of trade, soon after 2000 reached a near all-time high. What's the, what's the peak in the 1950s in that chart? Remember a couple of weeks, weeks ago? Yes. Yeah, the Korean War. So that's the big surge in wool prices. The difference in this more recent surge, it is that it was, it's uh mining commodities, so it's iron ore and coal rather than uh wool that's uh driving this. So Then Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, expressed it well that it used to be that a shipload, being care if I say that, of iron ore was worth the same as 2000 flat screen televisions, now it's worth $20,000 and that was driven by both the numerator and denominator. So the price of the iron ore was going up, but the price of televisions was going down. So both good news for Australia. Here's an update on, on that. Uh, we're now past that uh peak in the early 1950s, uh, in terms of trade reached an all-time high recently and they're still very close to that all-time high. So Australia uh was was sort of given the label of being a sort of a quarrier economy, uh, you know, mining is, is obviously a big industry in Australia, um big literally, I mean, look at the size of that tyre relative to that guy standing next to it. So what proportion of Australia's GDP do you think mining constitutes? How much? 13. Anybody else? 20, I've got 13, I've got 20, it's against you. Yep. OK, so you're obviously a better informed group than the average Australian. So the average Australian thinks mining is about 30% of the economy. Uh, but even, even when mining is doing very well, it, it, it is more like around about 1010 to 15 and usually quite a bit less than 10. And in terms of employment, it's very small, so it's like 1 or 2%, uh, typically. And All these slides are gonna be available for you later, by the way. Um, and in terms of the growth in employment over the last decade or so, uh, mining contributes virtually nothing, so it's, it doesn't employ many people. Uh, but the propagandists that the mining council have been very good at, uh, persuading people that it's more important than it actually is. Another important point about mining is that a lot of the money goes off offshore, uh, it doesn't stay in Australia because something like 80% of our uh mining is foreign owned. Now, uh, this gentleman, you may recognise, his office is only 100 metres or so away from us, uh, Bob Gregory, and he talked about how, uh, the mining industry causes the exchange rate to appreciate and that in turn damages some of our other sectors. So again, uh. There, there can be an exaggeration of the impact that mining uh contributes to the economy. Same phenomenon is called the Dutch Disease Acts of outside Australia. So, If you get up to say 2005, selling lots of coal and iron ore to a new bestie, getting top dollar for it. What could go wrong? These sort of guys, So we had the global financial crisis. So it started in the US. And To a lot of people's surprise in the part of the financial system that was regarded as being the most secure and safe, namely houses. You know, home lending was regarded as being as safe as houses. So part of it was just outright fraud like this character, uh, operating a Ponzi scheme. But it was also. A product of financial deregulation and, you know, innovation and, and new products, so things like uh mortgage backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and so on. Uh, various types of uh derivatives, so you may have heard of options and futures, but these were much more complex versions, so we sometimes trading a future on an option on a future. And and housing lending got, uh, got much riskier. Have you heard of the expression a ninja loan? Means no income, no job, no assets. Now you might think that sounds like a person you probably shouldn't be lending to, uh, but, In this brave new world of of finance, they will lend to. Uh, they're also what were called low doc loans. So if the standard interest rate was 6% and you expected to show this is how much money I earn, this is what assets I have, and this is my credit record, the bank would say, OK, if you give us that information, we'll charge you 6%, or we'll give you a loan at 10%, and you don't have to give us any of that information. What sort of people would be willing to pay an extra 4% interest to, to be a bit secretive about their history? People with something to hide. So you might think they might not be a very good person to lend to, but. No. Then there were teaser rate loans. So you get a loan and it starts off for the first couple of years at 2% and then it jumps up to 8%. And people would say work out the repayments at 2%, yeah, I can manage that easily, no worries, I'll take out the loan. Uh, well, 8% might be a bit hard, but I'll worry about that later. And Now you might think that these uh seem fairly foolish types of uh arrangements for a loan. And you'd be right. But if you said that at the time, you were told you were some boring old fart that didn't understand modern finance. So I don't, don't know what the bank regulators were doing while this was happening, uh, you know, asleep at the wheel, uh uh I would say. So, however, some of these products, these mortgage backed securities, were getting AAA ratings from uh the rating agencies. So, um, they're not innocent on this either. And that was because there was this massive conflict of interest. Who paid the rating agencies, the banks that were getting them to give the ratings. So the rating agency knew if we say this, This bond is a bit of rubbish, they'll go down the street and, and go to another rating agency and we'll lose their business. So every incentive was for them to say, yeah, yeah, this, this is a AAA, this is and. People took a false sort of confidence in this. So the Ringa Barriby Shire in Barrell and Mittagong, that area, they were investing in mortgage backed securities in the US. And I mean, I, I doubt their shire clerk knew much about how any of these things were structured, but he, he naively said, well, they're AAA rated, so they must be safe. And people around the world lost a lot of money because these things weren't safe. A lot of them would have worked if house prices kept going up strongly and never went down, but that wasn't what happened. The US housing market tanked. When house prices went down, people were defaulting on their mortgages, and these mortgage backed securities became in many cases worthless. But part of the problem was they were so complex, it was very hard to tell which ones still had value and which were worthless, so people dumped all of them and the prices of them collapsed. People who'd taken out loans to buy them collapsed, and this contagion spread around the world. People in in in China, people in Europe, people in South America were being affected by this. And once some of the banks started to collapse, The banking system itself froze up because nobody knew which banks had bought these rubbish securities and which ones hadn't, so you didn't know who you could trust, where your money was safe. So the whole financial system started to collapse and had to be bailed out. And we're not talking small amounts of money, we're talking a $700 billion bailout. And as I said, the crisis spread around the world. And this had a really bad effects on the global economy. Economic activity started to contract, so we see what happens in that red line USA 7, and you can see that GDP falls by 5% and then recovers, but at the time we didn't know it was going to recover. It was heading down on a path virtually the same as the 1930s, uh, Great Depression. And Nobody knew if it was gonna turn around, or how much the economy would contract before it turned around. So these, these were, these were very scary times, uh. So this shows the impact on GDP growth of of this what was then called global financial crisis. And so, rather unfairly, uh, the even though the problem was caused by and originated in the US, the impact was actually larger in some other places than it was in the US itself. So there's actually bigger contraction. Australia got off relatively lightly. Um, a, a matter of a combination of good luck and good management. Um, our banks were less exposed to this sort of stuff because they're a bit more, uh, insular. Uh, and our financial system was better regulated than, uh, the US. But you know, we're still, instead of economy growing at 4%, we had an economy growing at 2%. Uh, Japan contracted, uh, very sharply. China still expanded, but. You know, a country that had been expanding at 14% was now growing at 5%, so it, it, it took a big hit too, and the world as a whole contracted by 2%, 1st time in in decades that the whole global economy had shrunk. So that was The first sort of big hit that the global economy has taken this century. The second one, is going to be much more alive in your minds, which is the COVID, uh, recession. And that that was probably slightly sharper. Uh it was uh a bigger contraction in many cases than the GFC, but it was short-lived, so. The, the economies contracted because people were locked in their houses, essentially, but then once they were allowed out, the economy bounced back, recovered quite strongly. So you see in 2021, uh, the unusually fast growth reversing most of the, the fall in 2020. And then we've got um. Economy returning to Relatively stable growth in the 2020s, albeit at a slower rate than we'd, we'd seen, uh, in the period, say 1950 to 1975, uh, or even 1975 onwards. So it was, it's sort of a more modest, uh, growth. So the COVID downturn is that uh I've used UK data here just because it, it goes further back, and it was the biggest downturn since 1706. And as I said here, the GFC and COVID were the only two times, uh, this, this century, uh, that we've seen real GDP in the whole global economy, uh, contract. And if you took this chart back, I think you have to go back probably to the 1930s to see a, a, a, a contraction like that. So what did we do in response? Well, Um, thanks, thanks to John Maynard Keynes, we'd learned some lessons about the, how to deal with the depression, uh, from the 1930s, mistakes that were made then. So central banks, the Reserve Bank and its peers cut interest rates to zero, and some countries actually below zero, and also introduced some more unconventional monetary policy measures as well. And there was fiscal stimulus. So in, in both, uh, these big recessions, governments gave money to people, so sent them checks or, um, put money in their bank account. Also, uh, during the GFC, uh, governments recapitalized banks, so, um, Stop banks going bust. And also guaranteed deposits. So that stopped a bank run. So the concern was, if nobody's sure which bank is safe, people will pull their money out of every bank. And the, you know, you think the first people that pull their money out will get all their money. The people who will last in the queue won't. So that leads to a, a rush and leads to a bank run. By governments coming in and guaranteeing no matter what your place is in the queue, you're gonna get all your money, then there's less uh reason for people to panic and, and try to be in the front of the queue. And. Um, in the case of Australia, Rudd government guaranteed bank deposited up to 11 million, and also for a fee guaranteed wholesale liabilities, and that worked out very well in two senses. One, it stopped the bank run. We didn't have any banks collapse in Australia, and secondly, the government uh earned quite a bit of money on those fees. So this shows what, what happened to uh interest rates, so, uh, going down to 0. And the US is a more conventional one there. It sort of goes down to 0, then after the GFC, it goes back up, and then it goes back down under COVID, then it goes back up. In the case of Europe and Japan, interest rates got lower but never really got up very much and, uh, before they had to go down again in the, uh, the GFC. So this is some of the unconventional monetary policy. This is the central banks buying bonds, including in some cases corporate bonds. Um, and again, Australia joined in this, this pattern, and, you know, it, it worked in the sense that we got out of both recessions. Uh, so here we have, uh, uh, Australia's. Cash rate target, policy rate of the Reserve Bank. And you can see the pattern. So this afternoon it's dropped below 4%, dropped to 3.85%. So I said, it's John Maynard Keyne's picture there. He, he sort of learned the lessons from the 1930s that, uh, contracting government spending would only make a a depression worse, uh, that you needed an expansionary countercyclical fiscal policy, and largely that that was done. There was a bit of argument about it during the GFC. Uh, the opposition thought the government was doing too much. Uh, during COVID, it was, it was much more bipartisan. There didn't seem to be much criticism of the idea of government spending, uh, a lot of money, uh, at all. Result of that though is it's much easier to push money out in the economy than to pull it back, and so governments uh have been in substantial deficits, um, well, since the GFC they've, Only for a couple of years got back into a surplus, and now we're heading towards more deficits probably for at least the next decade. Also important in terms of the policy response to both these recessions was what wasn't done. So again, we learned the mistakes from the Great Depression of the 1930s. There wasn't a retreat from free trade into protectionism, so there weren't huge increases in tariffs, virtually no increase in tariffs. Now, of course, When Donald Trump comes in, there are increases in tariffs in the US to which China has responded, but in these two recessions, that, that didn't happen. They also learnt the lesson about fiscal austerity being unhelpful. And they didn't try to compete with each other to devalue their exchange rates. So those were all things that happened in the 1930s that were mistakes and they weren't repeated. So Another uh outcome of this idea of the, the China boom and the importance of mining in our, our exports is is that it's led, led to a sort of multi-speed economy. So while New South Wales and Victoria and the rest of Australia grew more or less at similar rates, you can see a big difference in WA. So during the mining, when commodity prices are doing well, when there's a, a great incentive to dig up, Uh, minerals. Western Australian economy sort of booms, uh, when the mining sector moves, you know, into a weaker period, Western Australian economy contracts. And you, you see that reflecting unemployment rates too. So, uh, in, in the best years, unemployment in WA got under under 3%. Yeah, it was one of the higher rates in the, uh, higher unemployment states, uh, when the mining sector was doing less well. OK. So, Where's the economy going from here? So this is, this is hot off the press. This is from the Reserve Bank's uh statement uh released this afternoon. And it shows That the COVID recession, the recovery from COVID, and then a slow down as interest rates were sort of normalised. Now interest rates are, are coming back down. They expect uh the economy to grow, uh, a bit faster. And uh the, the prediction is, is about 2% growth in the next year or two, going forward. But note they're, they're, they're quite sort of modest about their forecasting abilities, um, with good reason. And so they're, they're making a statement in this chart. There's a 90% chance that by 2027, the economy will be somewhere between a recession and a huge boom. So as I said, these slides will all shortly be available to you. Uh, there's a list here of uh things that you can read if you wanna know more about uh this period. There's also things you can watch, um, the, the selection of films here that, uh, illustrate particularly the, the, the GFC. So Frank asked me to be a bit more succinct uh this time, I've probably overdone it, but. But anyway, um. Um, very, very happy to answer, and try to answer any questions you have on this period, and as I said earlier, also very happy to, uh, try to answer questions about, um, careers.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, well, thanks so much, John. Yeah, so are, are there, we've got time for questions and answers, so are there any, uh, you know, questions and answers for, for John? It's quite complex material, isn't it, the GFC stuff. So please feel free to, if you don't understand what a derivative is or whatever, um, please feel free to, to ask. Yes Um, OK, so Um, is essentially a, a bet

SPEAKER 2
on uh another financial asset. So um instead of buying a BHP share, you can buy a uh a futures contract on a BHP share or you can buy an option on a BHP share. And your return will be much uh more exaggerated with the uh derivative than actually buying, buying the share. So supposing the BHP share is $50 you can buy an option, a $100 option on it, which becomes very valuable if the share price goes over $100 but is worth nothing if the share price doesn't reach $100. So you might pay $1 for that derivative. So if the BHP share price then goes from $50 to $150 instead of getting an extra $100 for a purchase of $50. Uh, you've got $50 for a purchase of $1. So you can make much bigger gains, but you're also exposed to much, much bigger losses, uh, with an option, uh, or a future. So those, those type of derivatives have been around since ancient times. But what was new in, uh, this, this period of the, um, 1980s, 1990s, early 2000s, was the complexity of it. So you'd have, instead of a, a futures contract on a share, you'd have a futures contract on an option on a future of a share was, was, um, and they were packaged up in very, very, uh, complex ways. Remember my former bosses saying he uh used to think that nobody over 30 understood how, how these derivatives contracts worked and then he realised nobody under 30 understood them either, so. Um And I think it was a complexity that meant that people were buying things that they really didn't understand what exposures they had, and it seemed like particularly in the US, the financial supervisors didn't realise what sort of risks banks were undertaking, either by issuing or by buying those contracts.

SPEAKER 1
Frank What happens today? I've been like the Well, given they're not in government,

SPEAKER 2
probably none.

SPEAKER 3
Um, it seems to be Yeah. What's the So The recessions occur in a kind of

SPEAKER 1
knowledge.

SPEAKER 2
OK, so I think as far as Australian economic policy makers are concerned, that the global financial crisis was caused by a collapse in the global economy, particularly in the US economy, so it wasn't their fault. And the more more recent recession was due to COVID, which again wasn't Australian economic policymakers's fault. And I take some uh satisfaction as an economist from the fact that the, the, the response was so much better in the, to the GFC and to COVID than it was to the depression in the 1930s. In that We didn't make all in the 1930s, economic policy basically made things worse, so. There was an obsession about keeping government um books balanced, so that meant they cut back government spending when tax revenue started to dry up. And and if anything they put taxes up a bit to try to get more tax revenue in. And that just made the economy weaker. That's just made things worse. They also tried putting up tariffs as a way of keeping activities strong within uh domestic economy. That also just made things worse. If, if we weren't buying anything from people overseas, they couldn't buy anything from us, so everybody's export industries got hit. So that just uh made things worse also. Uh, and they, they didn't really respond by loosening, you know, interest rates much either. So, the, the policy responses in the 1930s were terrible, and we learned from that, and the policy responses in, in 2008 and, and 2020 were much, much better.

SPEAKER 1
And John, would you say that there was a recession in Australia in the early 19. Uh, would, would you say. That certain lessons were drawn from that that were. By policy makers during the GFC.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, we became, we became much better with fiscal policy. So Ken Henry said go hard, go and and go uh households. Um, so in the early 1990s there was a recession and governments thought about what fiscal policy response there could be, and they mainly thought in terms of big sort of construction projects. So let's build some roads or some railways or some bridges or something. But the trouble is things like that take, you know, years to plan and and and get going. And, and so that by the time tho, those sort of projects were underway, the economy had recovered anyway. So, you need things that'll have an impact quickly. So that's why both the GFC and, and COVID, they gave money to households and gave it in ways that made it more likely to be spent quickly. So you had a, had a quick, uh, uh, stimulus measure. So it was a, a better designed fiscal response. Thank Um, So the short short run problem was inflation got away from central banks a little bit. Uh, they weren't expecting inflation to kick up as much as it did. Now I I, I think there were sort of understandable reasons there. So. We were, experts said that it was gonna take years to develop a vaccine for COVID, and it actually took took months. So the economy wasn't as badly hit, uh, as, as experts were expecting. And so with the benefit of hindsight, The fiscal and monetary response was larger than it needed to be. On the information people had at the time though, I think the response was, was, was about probably about right, it was sensible given what what people were saying, people were saying we're looking at unemployment of 20% and this could last for years. So a very big economic response sort of made sense. Given that it that the, uh, you know, vaccines were, were found and and economies were able to sort of open up again quicker than expected, with hindsight that was overdoing it and so. And then the next shock that came, which again, I, I don't blame the Reserve Bank for not foreseeing, uh, was Russia attacking Ukraine, and that's uh led to commodity prices going up. So you had this inflationary impetus and it happened all around the world. Uh, and, and so inflation sort of took off. Again, in almost every country, and then central banks had to respond to that by putting up interest rates. And so Uh, the third of households that third of households that have a mortgage were hit by the higher interest rates. Other people were hit by the fact that prices were going up and wages didn't go up as much. So that's, that's sort of where the cost of living, uh, crisis. As it's occurred in the last few years came from. The In the sort of longer term though. The extent to which Real wages, so think of which wages can grow faster and prices will depend on how much we improve our productivity, so how much output we get relative to input, and productivity growth has, has, has slowed. And it's slowed in Australia more than in other countries for reasons that we're not quite sure about. And so that will limit the extent to which living standards can grow in the future if we can't figure out what's causing that and and do something about it. So Jim Chalmers said a day or two after the election that his first term as treasurer was concentrating on inflation with an eye on productivity, and this term will be concentrating on productivity but keeping an eye on inflation. So, um, you know, he's charged the Productivity commission with coming up with ideas, uh, for things that can improve productivity. And, and that might be getting more competition in the economy, getting rid of non-complete, complete clauses, things like that, uh. There's not much talk yet about tax reform, but that's probably one area that that could improve things. Other areas of improving competition? Uh, in the longer term improving education. Uh, and you know there's other things the Productivity Commission will be, um. Looking, looking into, but that's sort of a challenge facing is, is, is getting productivity growth, um. Back to where, where it used to be getting more growth in productivity. And, and that's what's sort of necessary to get increases in good increases in living standards.

SPEAKER 1
So the um. Figures you showed, John show that at the moment, growth in GDP or at least 2024 growth in GDP is about 1% or a bit above 1%, so. How, how do we account for that slowing. Parent loan Over the last Is it related to productivity? stagnation The sort of medium term trend, the fact that

SPEAKER 2
it's, uh, GDP is growing slower over the next, expected to grow slower over the next few years than it did in the, um, 1950s, 960s, 1970s, 980s, that's productivity. The short run, uh, slowdown is a response to the Reserve Bank putting up interest rates, and they were putting up interest rates to get inflation back under control.

SPEAKER 1
So we would expect all things very. Decline in interest rates. Uh, that's There would be a return to uh high levels growth, provided we don't have a a blowout of unemployment.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, so at, at the moment, Reserve Bank's now made their 2nd interest rate, uh, cut, and that's, that's why they're forecasting, uh, GDP to grow a bit more faster going forward. I think what's the big risk to that is probably not domestic, it's, is there going to be a massive trade war. So if those US tariffs of 174% against China and 150% of China and the US, if that. If they continued, and at the moment they've been um scaled back, but that's only for 90 days, we don't know whether that's gonna be a permanent thing. Uh, you know, if, if tariffs stayed at those levels, then, uh, there'd basically be an end to trade between the US and China, so. Uh, that would be a major disruption to the global economy, and if China's not able to sell stuff to the US, they're, they're, they'll make a lot less stuff, and then they'll want a lot less of our iron ore and coal. Uh, and they'll be poorer, so there'll be fewer tourists and students coming here. So that's, that would be bad news for Australia. The sort of direct effect of the tariffs on Australia is fairly small, only 5% of our exports go to the US, so we can handle the 10% tariff. It's that indirect effect of what impact will the tariffs have on, on China, our largest export market. Any other Um, I enjoyed being when I was in, in Parliament House, and I was sec and secretary of the Senate Economics Committee, um, because I, I really liked being right in the parliament and, and being there while all lots of things were, were happening, so I was there when Kevin Rudd was giving the apology. Um, I, I, I, I was, um, in, in the room when the Godwin Grech affair, uh, blew up and it looked for a while like, uh, the government was gonna fall. Yeah. Um, yeah. I, I don't know if you remember, um, Nick Xenophon, he was on, on the committee while I was there. Uh, Barnaby Joyce, he was also on the committee while I was there. So that, that, that was, um, sort of exciting and, and interesting. So it was, it was during, during the GFC. So one of the inquiries we were doing was into the government's response. And so you had, had people arguing, uh, this is, this, this is. Necessary to stop the economy collapsing, and other people saying, you're incurring a massive debt, this is fiscally irresponsible, this is gonna be disastrous. So there were, you know, big stakes, uh in the arguments that were being held there. Uh, I think they'd, they'd be stronger. I think you never fully make up from a recession, um, never catch up to the, the trend you'd be on. So I think the, the global economy would be better, we'd all be a little bit wealthier. Yeah. I studied economics at school, and I, I found it interesting. My best subject in school was maths. Um, my father wanted me to become an actuary, but I thought that sounded boring. Um, and I was always interested in politics. And I sort of felt economics combined the maths that I was good at and the politics I was interested in. And so Uh, I wanted to go to viewers in studying economics, and I, I got a scholarship from the Reserve Bank which enabled me to do that. And I, I later, uh, got a scholarship from also from the Reserve Bank, uh, to do my masters in Economics at the London School of Economics. So if I'm a bit soft towards Reserve Bank, my commentary, you know, it's because I'm, I'm a bit grateful to them. Yeah. Yeah, so, I mean, the more uncertain you think the world is, probably the more attractive, uh, uh, a career, uh, a job in, uh, uh, public service or, or the Reserve Bank, um, is. They're, they're quite competitive though, um, even, even more so, I think these days. Uh, so they get, they get a lot of applicants. So you, you need to be, uh, someone with good grades. And In, in a, in a job interview, you might well be asked about uh what was the appropriate policy response to some situation in the past. So I suspect uh doing this course would probably stand you in good stead for uh trying to get a job at either institution. And you could certainly throw in your answers to questions, references to history that will probably go down well. So.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. So John, if I could, I mean, obviously you've worked in and around a number of, of economic uh institutions, um. ask you to reflect on You know, the, the roles that they've played, the, the changing roles that they've played, you know, I guess in your observation, not, not going right back, but, you know, during your, your contact with them, and I, I miss that part of it because I guess one of the things that we hope to do if we're, we're going into a career is where you want to make an impact, where you wanna sort of uh. You know, to, to actually, um, somehow affect the world, and I, I'm just wondering what, what your experience of working treasury and working, uh, in, in Reserve Bank, um, the Economics Committee, which my wife also worked on recently, um, you know, what are your observations about the kinds of impacts, I suppose, that you could make as a, as an official in those context?

SPEAKER 2
Well, 11 change I've sort of, um, observed, uh, my career is the increased sort of power of the Reserve Bank. So it's Um You know, when, when we were talking about what was the main thing that uh. Main response to inflation, it was putting up interest rates. So, and those decisions on putting up interest rates were made independently by the Reserve Bank. They weren't made by the governor. And that's a change that happened gradually sort of over time. So if you, if you go back to the 1970s, like Fraser government era. Uh, there was a monetary policy, uh, committee of cabinet, uh, in which in those days, I think had 4 of the 6 members were farmers and. And they, they would decide what should happen with interest rates, and the government of the Reserve Bank would be sitting in the corridor outside that room waiting for the meeting to finish to be told what to do. Whereas now, interest rate decisions are taken by the central bank based on the board's view of what's in the overall interests of the community, regardless of what the politicians want. And, and. Paul Keating says I partly lost the election because the Reserve Bank were too slow getting interest rates down. John Howard and Peter Costello say, I, I, we partly lost the election because Reserve Bank put up interest rates during the election campaign. So they're, they're making independent decisions and. Have a, a big responsibility for what happens to the economy, so that makes working in the Reserve Bank quite um much more satisfying than it would have been in the 1950s or the 1960s, uh. And in the economic area at the Reserve Bank, which is where I mainly was, uh, the focus is all about that, and it was then a monthly board meeting, it's now 8 times a year, and, Looking at pouring over data and arguing. And it was, it's, it was and still is a very intellectually stimulating place and where the senior people are very open to hearing uh points of view from uh junior people and having debates and so on, so. Uh, and it's, it's all about recommending to the board, do we reduce interest rates or do we not, or do we put them up? And Uh It, it's never an easy decision. I mean, if it was obvious that interest rates should come down, they would have lowered them the previous meeting. So there's, there's always room for, uh, debate, and so that makes it an intellectually exciting place to be. In terms of um Treasury, it's. You know, still, the, the budget is still a large important sort of part of the economy, but maybe the, the microeconomics is more important than the macro now. The the Reserve Bank is the one that's more driving uh the overall macroeconomy. Um, but Things like How can we better design the tax system? I mean that's a very important challenge and that'd be a very also rewarding thing to do. I mean, it seems to me obvious that that government spending is going to increase as a share of the economy. There's bipartisan support to spend more on defence. There's disagreement about how much more to spend on the NDIS, but everybody seems to think it's going to go up. We've got an ageing population. We're going to be spending more on health inevitably. Interest rates are higher. We're going to be spending more on interest payments. Nobody wants to default on the debt. So I think the, the debate over the next decade will be what's the most efficient way of raising uh tax? What, you know, do we just let fiscal drag increase income tax or should we be?
