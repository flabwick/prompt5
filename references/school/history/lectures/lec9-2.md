SPEAKER 1
Now my recollection is that I had a work experience student. Um, in the department when I first did this, so the transition between slides is quite spectacular. You know, we have flying birds, we have all sorts of things, I believe, unless something's gone wrong with my slideshow. So don't imagine that I could do this myself. It required a a year 10 student to do it for me. Um, there you go, there we go. OK, uh, now we don't want that, we do want that. So, good. OK, well, I'd like to begin by acknowledging traditional owners, um, of the land in which we're meeting, Nunaw Manbury and pay my respects to elders, people and country. OK, so second part of our discussion of, uh, the 1980s, here my focus is more on business, um, but I also will talk about obviously the intersections of government policy at particular moments. Look at that. Um, so you're gonna really love. Uh, just to recap, I suggested at the end of last night's lecture that in many ways what we're seeing in the 1980s is a dismantling of some of the, Uh, pillars of, uh, what Paul Kelly calls the Australian settlement, allowing that white Australian and imperial benevolence had kind of, um, uh, already, um, been dismantled in the 1960s and 1970s, but, um, certainly there are reverberations that one could talk about in the 1980s, the Australia Acts, which, um, uh, were a kind of um final separation of, um, Uh, the Australian, uh, sort of legislative system from, uh, Britain's, um, or the British parliament, uh, is, is as late as 1986, OK, so you know, certainly some aspects of both white Australian imperial benevolence uh live on, I mentioned last night that there was a, Pretty vigorous debate over Asian immigration in 1984, particularly, and I think we could see perhaps, you know, again the legacies of the White Australia policy working themselves out in that respect in the 1980s, but it's these others I think that are probably more significant for understanding policy in this period, um, a movement away from the centralised system of of arbitration, of wage arbitration, wage determination, tariff protection or industry protection as it's called here, again. Um, largely dismantled in, uh, the 1980s and 1990s, but to particular cuts in 1988 and 1991. And I think generally a movement away from state paternalism towards, um, a greater emphasis on, on markets, and we saw that with respect to the floating of the dollar, um, and a range of other policies as well. OK, um, why does this happen? Um, well, uh, uh, you know, you've got a number of, uh, potential explanations we probably need to draw on, on several of them, I think. Um, certainly, and as I talked about last time, the rise in influence of a free market lobby from the 1970s, but stronger in the 1980s, and, and that certainly gave a boost to ideas of, um, the market and reliance on the market, um, and away from that kind of state paternalism. Uh, the influence of these kinds of ideas among among professionally trained economists who are embedded in the public service in the bureaucracy. This is called the Pewsey thesis after a sociologist called Michael Pewsey, who wrote a book, uh, Economic rationalism in Canberra. Um, in 19, uh came out at the beginning of the 1990s, and Peter's argument was actually in its essence, quite, uh, a simple one, and it was, uh, the argument that, um, uh, A group of professionally trained economists wedded to a broadly neoclassical understanding of of the economy with an emphasis on markets had managed to effectively gain an ascendancy within key parts of the Australian. Bureaucracy, it's not a conspiracy theory. It's basically arguing that a shift occurs in personnel and intellectual and educational background of those key senior bureaucrats and thinking particularly of Treasury or Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury and finance, those key central agencies. So the much criticised, uh, the Puy thesis also defended, but you know, it emphasises the role of public servants in particular, very different from that group of post-World War 2 public servants that Nicholas Brown talked about a few weeks ago, who were often trained in Keynesian economics, a very different, um, uh, set of ideas. Thirdly, um, some would argue that this was a response to the problem of declining profits and a crisis of capitalism, so arguing that, you know, um, you know, in the 1970s businesses had been failing, that they've been unable to yield profits at a sufficient level to be viable. And the argument here goes that it was really only a labour government that could bring fairly powerful and empowered unions into an arrangement that would suppress wages in the interests of lower inflation and higher profits, and I talked about this broad argument yesterday, we might call this the Humphrey thesis after Li Humphries, it basically sees the accord, which I talked about yesterday, the prices and incomes accord. As a kind of vanguard neoliberalism, so arguing that it brings in, you know, it's, it's kind of in, in the vanguard, it leads this, this idea of freer markets, um, so, uh, and, and ushers in a different kind of order. 1/4 argument would just simply say that this was a necessary response to globalisation and the rapid and massive transnational. Transfers of capital, so you know you can see the way in which the decision to float the dollar, which is, you know, broadly a decision about bringing markets in to a greater extent, is essentially this sort of argument. It basically says, look, there's massive transfers of global capital. Um, it's absurd for 4 officials to be sitting in Canberra attempting to set the price of the dollar each day, that in the context of rapid massive transfers of money across the globe, facilitated by new technologies as a computer, a fax machine, and all the rest of it, that you do know what a fax machine is, don't you? Have you encountered a fax machine? No. It, it's a, it's a classic 1980s technology. It would take a picture of a document here. And transfer an image of it to the other side of the world or what could be the other side of the office for that matter, but it was a particular pre-email communications technology that was very actually transformative in the 1980s. Um, OK, so, uh, yes, in the context of those massive transfers of money, funds, capital around the world that, um, you know, you, you basically, the idea of states being able to control this and to regulate this in a tight way had kind of um become rather implausible. 1/5 argument would say that this, Was simply a necessary set of reforms to an over-regulated, faltering, and increasingly inefficient economy, so I would argue that Australia has a kind of stagnant economy by the early 1980s, a lot of inefficient industries, it's quite low, a lot of, you know, quite low tech manufacturing, so we, you've got robotics and all this sort of thing taking off in many plants in other countries, the Australian system remains pretty primitive by comparison, uh, the, um, Academic author, politician Barry Jones wrote a book called Sleepers Wake in the early 1980s that made that very argument that Australia was a long way behind other countries in terms of its sort of technological uptake, it's efficiency, it's, it's um productivity, that that uh we were a low tech industrial economy. And then finally, um, you know, the the argument, and this is another possible kind of explanation or part explanation is that it's about the rise of a cosmopolitan middle class with a global orientation and the eclipse of a working class whose interests were served by a more protected economy. So this is the idea of the rise of a service economy. An economy in which people like you, quite frankly, the tertiary educated people like me, um, have greater political power than in an industrial economy, more based on blue collar labour, where, you know, the, the unions in in those sorts of workplaces have much more power, they're much more wedded to the older forms of social and economic protection epitomised by the Australian settlement. So I'm not suggesting that any one of those is gonna basically give you an explanation on its own. We probably need several of them, which is what I'm suggesting right at the end there, maybe to think about the conjuncture of different forces, different factors during the 1980s coming together in particular ways, but they're the kinds of explanations that have been offered for the, you know, basically the end of that. OK, for the wind out. Is that reasonably clear, that big picture stuff? Any questions on that? Happy with that? Good, OK. Alright, look at that, we'll get to him in a moment. OK. There are more surprises in store for you in terms of the transitions. You'll never want to actually go to one of my PowerPoints ever again, will you, after today's effort. Uh, he, he, yeah, anyway, we'll move on. Um, the, the 1980s business boom was in its essentials a familiar enough beast being fueled by sharply rising prices. Combined with the bank's willingness to risk large sums of money, in fact, in the more competitive financial environment that I sketched out last night with foreign banks coming in, they're looking for customers, OK, which means they're more inclined to take risks, higher share prices, increased company valuations. Stimulated takeover activity. And that could then be used as security against the next loan, so you take over a company and say, oh, look at my asset here, and you can basically get access to more loan money and more equity for your next takeover or your next acquisition. Keep in mind, interest rates were pretty high in the 1980s. Uh, I mentioned yesterday that Australia's inflation rate was probably what, double on average, uh, the inflation rate of, you know, it's major trading partners, so this tended to push interest rates to higher levels. It made borrowing more expensive, it made the interest bills of government, as well as private industry, more expensive. OK. So interest rates high, and profits, partly as a result were often too low to absorb the kinds of obligations that businesses were taking on. OK. Very important contrast, and I'll talk a little bit more about this later, 1930s, debt. Remember back to the depression of the 1930s, 1930s debt is predominantly public, government debt. Predominantly government debt, 1980s debt is predominantly private debt. It's being run up by companies. OK, that still has massive public interest aspects to it, but, As I'll suggest in a moment, economists responded to this, uh, with new theories actually about the balance of payments, but I'll come to that a little bit later. So one of the ways companies would deal with cash flow problems was asset sales, you know, basically sell off something to get a pile of cash to pay off your bankers, pay share dividends. Um, but, but you can see there's a kind of spiral operating here, where governments are, uh, sorry, uh, private uh private businesses I should say, are basically going off, borrowing more money for the sake of acquiring more cash. And the cash and assets that were often buried in their takeover targets, you know, so they take over a company and the company has all sorts of, you know, sort of assets sitting within it, and then they'd pull those assets out. Sometimes the assets were actually cash. Companies would have cash sitting inside them. But if they had other assets, they'd sell off those particular assets as a way of of of essentially paying interest bills, OK? So Um, you had these quite sprawling empires, business empires emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, often engaged in a very diverse range of activities, and it was, there was a low level of visibility from the who, who do we have anyone here doing auditing in their studies, actuarial studies? Anyone doing that? OK, so there's a low level of visibility for those who are doing the checking. OK, those who are making assessments around the viability of businesses, those who are assessing credit worthiness, it's very difficult to read these companies because of their complexity, and indeed, a lot of that complexity is quite deliberate, OK, they they they're. Um, cultivating an opaqueness, a lack of, of, of, um, uh, a lack of, um, accountability, a lack of transparency in order to be able to keep borrowing and to keep, uh, expanding. So you have assets and money being shuffled among companies in ways that obscured the financial situation of any particular part. So you can have a big sort of empire, you could have one part of the the company absolutely bleeding money and another part kind of breaking even, but it was often difficult. It was difficult to see um or to assess the overall viability of um the the enterprise. And of course you have armies of lawyers and accountants who are advising how um these business people could organise their affairs in order to minimise their tax. So the, you know, the company rate is about 49%. But you know, the use of offshore tax havens still very much with us, really takes off in the 1980s, and so, you know, you had uh companies paying tax of 5 or 10 cents in the dollar or sometimes nothing at all. Of course, by the usual way in which tax havens work, you basically transfer the profits offshore, so that the profits that you're reporting in a particular jurisdiction. Look low or perhaps you're even reporting losses in a particular jurisdiction and it minimises your tax, and they're doing this on a on a widespread. Tax havens are places, you know, like the Cayman Islands and jurisdictions like that, that essentially launder money in this kind of way. So the ease with which money could be taken out of the country, encouraged the use of overseas tax havens, please don't forget the technologies that are facilitating this. OK, um, as I mentioned, uh, the computer. OK, the computer, the fax machine, all of this is facilitating much easier transfers of money, larger and larger amounts of money are floating around the globe in ways that, that, um, really, um, are much greater, much more intense than what had existed previously. OK, now let me take a quick break to give you something of the flavour of the period. I sometimes play this one right at the beginning because it's so good. OK. Here's a bank ad from 1988. It's the best expression I can think of in video form of some of the social and economic values of Australia in the period. It's a Western, a relatively small Western Australian bank.

SPEAKER 2
There You've been You took the challenge. With the Come take the. With the Well if if Professor Brown was here, I'd

SPEAKER 1
tease him at this moment and say, I bet you had a haircut just like that, Nick, didn't you? In the 1980s, I always do that, and he sort of blushes, it's quite fun. Um, so, um, what did you take out of that, 1988 bank ad, come and, you know, start an account with the Challenge Bank, maybe, you know, take out a loan with us, what's happening in that? What's it evoking?

SPEAKER 2
Is it like a sense of opulence and like kind

SPEAKER 1
of consumption, opulence. Fantastic, yeah, what else? Optimism, this is in the wake, by the way of the stock market crash, so you know, the advertising industry doesn't need to worry too much about what's actually happening in the real world. Anything else? Barristers, yeah, so as I just said, those armies of lawyers and accountants and others who are helping to make these companies rich. I think it's interesting like all of the sort of

SPEAKER 2
working. Yeah Really good point, it's absolutely, absolutely, the ambition, the,

SPEAKER 1
the social mobility and professional success extends to women. OK, it's a, it's a, uh, I suspect a, a much less blokey ad than something, some rough equivalent that you might have in the 70s, for instance, yeah. It does have a slight Wall Street feel about it, although less forbidding perhaps than, than, you know, sort of images of the, the stock market, and a sense of ambition of, of individual self-realization, perhaps through capitalism and all the rest of it. So yeah, um, and, and, you know, the Rick Price song sort of is the crowning glory of it really, isn't it? Um, so, you know, there there is, I, I think, a kind of naive optimism, uh, that develops in the 1980s. Uh, the BRW, you know, Business Review Weekly rich list is invented in the 1980s, its first year is 1983, for instance, so, you know, I think that's a, a, a marker of, of the change in Australian economic life during this period. So a naive optimism that values would keep climbing even if subject to occasional correction. Exactly the same kinds of things that had been seen in the what, the 1880s, if you remember, the period of the boom, land boom, Melbourne, all the rest of it, uh, to a lesser extent, perhaps in the 1920s and, and, and something of this too in, in the 1960s as well, uh, when, uh, uh, the mining boom was in full swing. Um, financial debt deregulation contributed something to this. Um, there's a lack of corporate regulation, so some of the, uh, federal bodies that are still with us in some form, are in a very formative, rudimentary state in the 1980s, so the formation of the National Companies and Securities Commission, the National Crime Authority, these all have their, I think ASIC would be the the successor of that first one I mentioned, which is still with us. But these are only being established in the 1980s, OK? And the companies are way ahead. Of them in terms of legal and accounting expertise, it's very difficult for these new agencies to exercise a kind of a regulatory authority over, quite frankly, a boom of a kind they hadn't really seen before. This was something different and something something new, including in its technological dimensions as I've already suggested. So, you know, the entrepreneurs, the business people, maintained teams of professionals that really were able to keep ahead, I think of the capacity of government to regulate them. OK, so deregulation um is increasing the international mobility of capital, competition among banks for local business is fierce. It gives borrowers market market power. OK, the borrower goes to the bank and the bank wants them. OK, and that's often a recipe as we saw in the global financial crisis a few years back, um, that's often a recipe for disaster. Um, but the result of all this competition and financial deregulation was not so much lower interest rates, but easier credit, easier credit, um, and a scramble for market share among the financial institutions. I use the term financial institutions rather than banks advisedly. One of the biggest collapses and scandals of the period involved a building society. Very poor regulation at the state level, it was Victorian government in this case, and it basically turned itself into a major financial institution marshalling billions of dollars, it was called Pyramid, based in Geelong in Victoria, and down it went down it went uh at the end of the 1980s. OK, let me introduce you to the first of our, our entrepreneurs.

SPEAKER 2
Put yourself here. Yes. To be sure sure be So They say it's to believe, but this has got twice. the be You may laugh, you may laugh, and you

SPEAKER 1
may say. That maybe it was hiding in plain sight. It was called mirage. They were telling us it was too good to be true. And it was, and it was, but you all wanted to go, didn't you? You all wanted to head out the door, you wanted to head off to Port Douglas, didn't you? Yes, yes. Well, let me tell you about this one, let me tell you about this one. We're back to our presentation, oh, where are we, there we go, there he is, look. What do we want, we want from there, don't we? There he is, here he is. OK. Of the new breed of entrepreneurs, going right, uh who came to prominence in the 80s, Christopher Skase, a former financial journalist, was perhaps the most dazzling. His name and image were tied I'm not gonna be able to say that I am I entirely, um irrevocably got there. Uh, to the luxurious Sheraton Mirage resorts that his Quintex group was building in Hawaii, on the Gold Coast and most spectacularly, as you just saw, at Port Douglas in northern Queensland. Skase had begun his career in the 70s as a financial jo as a, sorry, an employee of a stockbroking firm, then a financial journalist. His corporate empire he built entirely from scratch. In many ways he was a self-made man. His wife Pixie, there she is through the very best parties. The Skasees were the business world's glamour couple. Skase, the epitome of the new entrepreneurs, a private jet, luxury yacht, homes around the world. In 1987, he'd not yet turned 40. Even more famous. You have it? Was Alan Bond, leader of the Australia 2 syndicate that won the America's Cup for the first time, the yachting 12 metre yachting in Newport, Rhode Island in 1983. Do people know about the America's Cup and that, that, you know, people know about this in 1980 was huge. I mean, the amount of number of Australians who got incredibly excited as I did, we all did about the fact that our millionaires were faster than theirs. Extraordinary. Anyway, we did, um, it shows you something of the power of nationalism I guess and and popular, Popular feeling. Now Bond was said to be worth $200 million in 1986 and $400 million by 1987. In fact, he leveraged his prominence in relation to the yachting Australia to into screwing more money out of the banks. That's what you'd do, wouldn't you? I'm famous, I'm successful, give me more loan money, um. But he'd also, he'd taken on good businesses, so he had a you know a reputation going back to the 1960s for, you know, brinksmanship, um, and risk taking and being often on the verge of bankruptcy and all the rest of it. But he also in the 180s took on businesses that seemed very solid, including brewing, making beer, and it was widely believed you couldn't actually go broke selling beer to Australians, as in so many other aspects, the 1980s would prove that you could. Next, Oh Wasn't he great? You're jealous that you haven't had a work experience guy working for you. Anyway, here we go, here's my team, look at them. We used to win in those days, all the time, all the time. There they are. So that's after one of the glorious premierships of the 1980s. 1 of the greatest battles of the 1980s was fought between John Elliott, who you can see there in the middle, president of Carlton Football Club amongst other things, and this man, Robert Holmes at court, over control of Melbourne-based BHP Broken Hill Proprietary, you know, probably you've seen Simon around in the media, you know, Simon, that's that's his, his dad, he's his father. Simon was about. 13, I think he told me when his dad died in in 1990. Anyway, that this is one of the great corporate battles of the era. It would have been hard to conjure two blokes who were less alike, um, you know, Elliott was a smoking, football loving, uh, you know, major public persona, rugged, he, he presented as a kind of rugged Aussie bloke, without polish, without pretension. You know, he had um supposedly shared the tastes of the ordinary working man, it was all very blokey um but, In a, in a sense it was a bit of a facade because um in fact he comes from a kind of new breed of entrepreneurs who have things like MBAs, a Master of Business Administration, which he'd he'd taken out from Melbourne University. And he'd worked for McKinsey, still it's still a kind of thing, isn't it, working for one of the major consultancy firms. So he'd worked overseas for McKinsey and in a lot of ways he brought some of those methods to uh his business activities in the 1970s and 1980s. He was involved in a number of takeovers during the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in the takeover of CUB Carlton United Breweries, you know, that that that makes Foster's and. Uh, Victoria, bitter and all those sorts of things in 1983. And this was in some ways an this was a huge takeover. And very interestingly, it's in the same week as the floating of the dollar. And so the amount of money that Elliott was bringing into the country to, to fund the takeover of Carlton United Breweries at the end of 1983 was one of the things that actually helps trigger Keating and Hawke to act. Because they're worried about the impacts of those kinds of flows of capital on on inflation. OK, you bring that sort of liquidity into the economy. It has the potential for inflation, so that they wanted to subject that to the disciplines of the market. OK, so that's happening, that's one of the, the, if you like, the intersections between this stuff and what's happening in um, Um, in the, um, in the policy realm. OK, but the big battle, as I said, between Holmes Court and um uh uh Elliot Holmes a Court was a superb strategist, a superb business strategist. Basically did a lot of his own legal work, a lot of his own accounting work, um, at one point he was using a tractor company, a sort of, Unglamorous Western Australian tractor company as a vehicle for for buying up massive amounts of BHP shares. And while people weren't kind of looking or paying much attention. Uh, it came to light by October 1985, he controlled 11% of BHP. Now you might say, well, 11%, big deal. This is a huge, a huge company. OK, it's the biggest company in the country, it's historically important, of course, going back to the 1880s. It's worth in 1986 values $10 billion. $10 billion it has 60,000 employees, and it has 180,000 shareholders, different shareholders, which means that a lot of ordinary Australians in the days before widespread superannuation own shares in BHP and of course there was overseas share ownership as well. So it's a very important company. And um he he's building up his, his uh control or his his his stake in it um during this period, quite in in a fairly quiet sort of way. And it looked likely he would take control of the company unless a third player intervened, and that's effectively what um Elliott does. That's what Elliott does. And so you have this battle for the company in which the Elliott swamps, uh sorry, swoops I should say, Elliott swoops and does a mass with the backing of really the a section of the Melbourne business establishment. He basically buys up a huge number of shares, uh, in a single day in 1986. OK, huge number of shares, and so you end up with these two entrepreneurs essentially controlling large parts of the company. OK, large parts of the company, but neither of, it was a kind of stalemate though, neither of them controlled the whole company. OK, and so you end up both of them being put on the board for the time being, but a stalemate. Neither is actually able to gain control. Um, it would be resolved, of course, by the stock market crash of 1987, which meant that, uh, all of these figures were offloading shares because they were going broke, but I'll get to that in a moment. And the, the, the other, um, uh, thing that Elliott was very involved in, as I've said, rather like Bond, was this um uh quite aggressive pursuit of the beer market in Australia, which is a huge lucrative manufacturing industry, uh, they also see it's um potential for as a manufacturing export, as a potentially lucrative manufacturing export. And what's happening in this process is not only those lawyers and accountants, but the advertisers are also making vast sums of money, so let me bring bring us to our third of these. Oh, that's not the one, it's that one, isn't it? The 3rd of our uh. Yeah, so these, this is Mojo, the well-known Australian advertising firm, this is how they were trying to flog Swan Lager, which was uh a brewery that Alan Bond had taken over in Western Australia and was trying to turn into both a national and an international product.

SPEAKER 4
They said you'd never make it on the entertainment scene. That's what, joined the. for They said you'd never made. Because We You you you me Oh, you Oh it's made for you.

SPEAKER 1
So you had a series of, of um uh celebrities, we don't want that. You know, who, um, were great successors and they were able to reward themselves with a swan lager because it was drunk by successful people. But my particular favourite, this is a 1988 version of this to coincide with the bicentenary of the country, you know, the arrival of the First Fleet.

SPEAKER 5
They make it And they brought us out in chains.

SPEAKER 3
And dumped us in this harsh brown land and sailed off again.

SPEAKER 5
Make it We battled the scrum.

SPEAKER 3
And Selections this land we grew to love. They said we'd never make it when we stormed Gallipoli. It wasn't even an hour we'd have. It would never make. But You.

SPEAKER 1
So no one had told Mojo that um. Australia didn't actually win at Gallipoli. That's the advantages of doing a history degree, or doing history courses at ANU, you'd know this stuff. If you ever go into advertising, you won't make that mistake, would you? OK. There he's Alright, um, so there you have it, um, so yeah, those who, who sold, uh, expensive real estate, uh, antiques, clothing, luxury cars, or even beer, added thousands, um, of the newly, uh, well, thousands to their, their bank accounts. Um, by 1987, Australia was said to have 30,000 millionaires and 6600 multi-millionaires, and it had its first two billionaires. It had its first two billionaires, and now Robert Holmes a Court who I've already introduced you to, and Kerry Packer. Media empire. Um, the flamboyant display of wealth followed new money even more readily than it had the old, the rich built imposing and luxurious mansions, or they renovated old ones. A tennis court and swimming pool are essential, a water view very nearly so. But remember all of this is going on, this consumption, the consumption economy, the opulence is going going on alongside the decay of traditional manufacturing. Manufacturing employment is dropping in both absolute numbers and proportionately to the rest of the economy during the 1970s and 1980s. Unemployment. Remains resiliently high during the 1980s. It's usually up around 8%, dips a little bit at the end of the decade, but and then of course in the recession would be up in the double figures again in the early 1990s. Um, high levels of youth unemployment, unemployment was a way of life really for many young people in the 1980s. Uh, I talk about this in my own book on the 1980s, um. And for older people, once you've lost your job, very difficult in a restructuring economy to get back into it, to get a new job, to some people who lost their jobs the later 1980s, early 1990s, in their 1950s, you know, my kind of age, were never employed again. They never found another job. Um, and even for many of those in employment, money remained a constant worry. Very interesting phenomenon is, is that one of the ways in which people cope with the fact that they simply don't have enough money to get by is the expansion of personal credit. The 80s is the period of the expansion of the credit card. It's also a period where people are increasingly likely to take out loans in order to buy things like cars or to take a holiday. OK, and so effectively people are filling the gap between their income and their outgoings through personal credit, maxing out, and not just on one credit card, many people had one credit card in the 1970s, it was called Bank card, in fact it was a government thing, initially. Um, but you could have multiple credit cards in the 1980s and banks were prepared to give them to you, and people kind of filled the gap in their budgets by taking out large amounts of personal credit, as you imagine, it had its dangers, and let me talk a bit now about the bust. So Wall Street had its Black Monday on the 19th of October, 1987, it wiped about $800 billion almost 23% of the value of the shares on the stock market, uh, much higher, a much higher percentage than the 19, the famous 1929 crash, which was 13%. So 13% in the Depression one. And 23% in 1987, I mean, and there were genuine fears, I mean, I remember this, there were genuine fears of another depression. Australia's Black Tuesday, very connected to the world economy, especially in the United States, just happens the next day, as you'd expect. 25% wiped off the share market in a single day, $55 billion. And you've got, you know, anxious investors, large and small, crowding around stock exchanges, sometimes in the rain, it was raining in Sydney on that day. Looking, uh, you know, at the ribbon reporting these massive, these massive losses, and several of these entrepreneurs whose stars had shone brightly in the 1980s were now desperately, desperately trying to save the, save the furniture basically. So Holmes a Court was very quick again um to to realise that the game was up, and he was essentially trying to offload his public companies, the one where he had external shareholders in order to save his private company. He died in 1990. Alan Bond initially looked like he'd survive Black Tuesday, but, uh, he also eventually 1989, went bankrupt. He lost a vast sum of money, almost a billion dollars in the previous financial year, in 1988, 1989. Um, the largest loss, the largest corporate loss in Australian history up to that point. He was declared bankrupt in 1992 and in fact later served a prison sentence. Other entrepreneurs failed, uh, young Warwick Fairfax, 20 or 26 years old, he was, you know, from the famous media company. And he tried to take the Fairfax Media Group to turn it into effectively a private company rather than one owned by shareholders, but he does it in the midst of of this crisis. OK, he sort of initiates it before the stock market collapse. Stock market collapse happens. If you wondered how Malcolm Turnbull got so rich, this is actually more or less where he got his start, finding finance for Warwick Fairfax, young Warwick Fairfax to pay his next interest bill in 1987, 1988. OK, um there was a widely circulated joke uh in the late 80s, how do you uh start a small business in Australia? And the answer was you give a big business to Warwick Fairfax, um, kind, I think, but anyway. Um, so, uh, you know, uh, Fairfax basically passes out of the control of the Fairfax family, a company that had basically been within the control of that family since the 18, 1840s, the 1840s, yeah. OK, um, so widespread failure, Christopher Skase's, um, Quintex empire, uh, went down, uh, the companies were suspended from the stock exchange, and he eventually fled to a Spanish island where he died at the age of just 52, uh, in exile to avoid being prosecuted in Australia for various, uh, um, well he was accused of of crimes in relation. To his business activities, um, several financial institutions ran into problems. Two state banks lost vast sums of money and are no longer with us. You'll notice the State Bank of South Australia overextended and uh basically had to be wound up. And the State Bank of Victoria. OK, there's no State Bank of Victoria, again, it uh was a victim of this period. It had a a merchant banking arm called Tricontinental which overextended. People didn't realise that essentially the the the whole bank, State Bank of Victoria, big bank, big state bank was essentially responsible for the bad debts that have been run up by this small merchant banking sort of arm of the state bank, so the State Bank of Victoria. Was initially absorbed into the Commonwealth Bank, the federal government owned bank, which in turn was privatised by the Keating government, so the Commonwealth Bank is still with us, but it's not a government bank, right? And and as a part of all these shenanigans, if you like, it is also privatised in the midst of this, so it absorbs the essentially broke State Bank of Victoria and and then is itself privatised, sold to shareholders. Um, interesting though, the stock market collapse doesn't produce a depression. Um, in fact, there's a kind of surge of investment, but it's a certain type of investment, it's a surge of investment, particularly into, um, uh, property, OK, commercial property. And of course it's highly speculative, it's based on the idea, oh you know, buy a city office block, and in the end it'll always be valuable, people will always want city property, well, they didn't. Because there was an excess of things like office space, with the result that people had big debts, they bought up, uh, you know, this sort of property, and they found themselves unable to service their debts. And so what you had was a kind of an overheating. Economy during this period that was becoming inflationary. There's a large amount of liquidity in the economy in the aftermath of the stock market collapse and it's been plunged into a relatively narrow range of enterprises, in contrast with what the government of the day is trying to do. OK, it's trying to basically strengthen the economy in the ways that governments still talk about strengthening the economy, all this will be familiar, you know, to you. Reducing reliance on commodity exports, sophisticated manufacturing, high skill, our university system today was essentially reformed in this period, so it contribute to this sort of vision of economic growth, and it was all about closing the balance of payments. OK, now I'm not gonna, because I'm running out of time as I always do, I'm not gonna talk about, The re theorising of the concept of balance of payments, I'll do that in the 1990s lecture where it probably sits better anyway, but these are the kinds of things the government's trying to do during this period to strengthen the economy, but it's facing this crisis of excessive liquidity and and inflation. And it responds in the way that governments tend to do. By upping interest rates. OK. To try and dampen the economy. And then of course, once the economy slows. It reduces interest rates. But in the process of upping them and then reducing them very they went up to about 17 18%, we're talking very high interest rates. They've broken a number of businesses and households who are highly leveraged, who have big debts. OK, so if you're a business, you have big debts, your interest rates, your bills have gone up and up and up, and by the time the government's bringing them down, your business is failing. OK, and so there's a lot of this going on. This is the background to the recession of the 1990s. Keating described as the recession, Keating as treasurer, the recession Australia had to have, which wasn't much consolation, of course, to those who just lost their jobs or their businesses. So I'll leave it there today and uh we'll obviously move on to talk about the 1990s and the recession when I next speak to you. So thank you.

SPEAKER 5
Just asking the question. I also wanna chew a little bit. referencing Selling Cornish, his presentation, is that just?

SPEAKER 1
Yes, of course, yeah, I mean, make sure you're doing reading as well, but yes, if there's something particular in his notes you want to reference, that's fine.
