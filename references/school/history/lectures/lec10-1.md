SPEAKER 1
OK, let's get a start. I begin by acknowledging traditional owners of the land on which we're meeting Nunnawal and Nanba and pay my respects to people, elders, and country. OK, moving right along, the 1990s. Um, recession, recovery, and, uh, resilience. I'll begin with just a recap of, uh, developments in the late 80s, um, leading up to the recession. I'll then discuss, uh, some of the, the, the sort of broad. Indicators looking at the recession of the 1990s, and, um, some of the major themes of, uh, that decade. So, um, just taking us back to the late 1980s, and I haven't discussed this, this slide yet, um. So You remember 1986, uh, the so-called banana republic crisis where Paul Keating says unless Australia can turn its balance of payments around, it will end up as a banana republic, as he said in a, A uh an interview with John Laws on on uh Sydney radio, um, and, Um, a lot of the, uh, policies of the later 80s emerge out of, um, you know, a, a, a fear of the consequences of a balance of payments, a structural balance of payments deficit, you know, it's the old. Very old problem in Australian economic history, faced by governments, 1890, 1930, this notion of Australia earning less in the world from its exports than it's able to um uh than it's able to earn. Uh, sorry, sorry, learning, uh, earning less from its exports than it is spending in the world on imports, OK, so that, that's the problem the government believes it faces in the, uh, mid to late 1980s, and a lot of its policies, as I'll show you in a moment, were, were really geared towards, uh, dealing with that particular. Problem which the government understood is linked in particular to Australia's excessive dependence on the export of a narrow range of commodities. OK, so it's all about trying to create a more complex economy that will make Australia less vulnerable to the kinds of external shocks that it had suffered in in the past. So, you know, here, here is the kind of um agenda that emerges. It doesn't emerge as a manifesto at an election or anything as fancy as that. Um, these are policies that are kind of improvised and they broadly reflected the directions of the government since 1983, but also they reflected the particular understanding that government had of the crisis that it had faced in 1986, so, Um, there is a movement towards decentralisation of industrial relations, moving away from, you know, the old centralised system associated with the arbitration court, as it was originally called, right back in the early 1900s, the early 20th century. By this stage, it's usually called the arbitration commission. Um, this, this idea of, um, uh, centralised wage determination. So the government's moving away from that and it wants to link wage increases to productivity and goes down this path in 1988. And with it, you get the emergence of a more decentralised system. That would eventually be legislated really during the Keating years and this was the notion of enterprise bargaining where you'd essentially have more direct bargaining between unions and employers, uh, in the workplace, as distinct from older systems involving state-based and national unions. Industrial tribunals either at the state or the federal level, but in some ways what's critical at this juncture is the link to productivity. So this was all about trying to resolve those problems of uh um you know, Australia's incapacity, it's perceived incapacity to pay its way in the world. Tariff cuts, I've talked about this before, Australia had tariff cuts back in 1973 under Whitlam at 25%. Um, when the Hawke government comes in in 1983, it certainly doesn't signal it's gonna go down the path of tariff cuts. Indeed, it signals the exact reverse initially. This is not the time for tariff cuts. We're in the middle of a recession, but that was 1983. By the time you get to the period coming out of the balance of payments crisis, 1987, 1988, the government decides that um it needs to cut tariffs again in the interest of creating more efficient industries. This, You're familiar with these debates because they are with us right now, aren't they? The argument against, you know, uh, Trump's tariff increases is that uh it'll create more inefficient industries behind tariff walls and uh higher prices for consumers. I mean that's the argument that is put against what Trump's doing. Uh, the tariff cuts of 1988 and then another round of tariff cuts in 1991, rather bravely in the middle of a recession, by the time we get there, were very much designed to increase the efficiency of of Australian industry. This happens though amidst much debate, much angst. People are worried about unemployment, um, they're worried about. industries about hastening deindustrialization in a way that will weaken the economy. All of those arguments are being put against what the government, um, is, is doing, but the government remains pretty steadfast and uh cuts tariffs in, in those two rounds at the end of the 80s and early 90s. Um, this is of course associated with. Um, the government's commitment to multilateral free trade, so this is the idea that right, we'll cut our tariffs, and other countries should be doing it as well, and, and this is very much about, um, uh, placing Australia's exports and particularly its commodity exports on the market at a time when protectionism was rife in both Europe and the United States, particularly farm protectionism. OK, so multilateral free trade, Australia is a part of a group called the Cairns Group of, Exporting countries, it's not a regional grouping cause it it includes countries from different places in the world, but what they have in common is a heavy dependence on commodity exports, particularly agricultural exports, and Australia was one of the leading countries in that group arguing for multilateral free trade, lower tariffs around the world. And then you've got areas that came under, but who, who is doing microeconomics or has done microeconomics. So these are the kinds of policies, the next batch that really came under the the heading microeconomic reform. So airline deregulation is a good example. Australia had, from the 1940s, really a two airline system, it had, A public or government carrier, which uh was called TAA for most of the period, right at the end it was called Australian Airlines, it was a government owned airline, and there was a, it competed with a private airline, the, the, the major one I mean there were some smaller regional ones, but the major one was, was called Ansett. And, and, you know, it, it was essentially a highly regulated system. The government, labour government back in the 40s would have preferred to nationalise domestic airways. They tried. The, the High Court had invalidated the government's attempt to do that. It said it was unconstitutional, it interfered with section 92 of the Constitution guaranteeing free trade. So what you end up with is a two-airline system where you have a public carrier, a government carrier competing with a private one, but it's highly regulated. They're effectively operating like a duopoly, and I can tell you from firsthand experience, you'd go up to the desk, I'm old enough to remember this, I just started flying when this was still in, you'd go up to the desk at Qantas if you, you're getting a ticket, you know, um, uh, You know, on the hop, you know, not, not, not ahead of time, and they'd say, um, no, we, we don't, but I, Ansett will be able to give you one. I mean it was incredibly close cooperate, but basically a a duopoly which kept prices very, very high. OK, so, you know, the, um, much higher than today. Most people did not use, um, aeroplanes in the late, in the 1970s, 1990s, 1980s. You use them only on the most special of occasions if you could afford it, because it was incredibly expensive to fly in this country in a way that is not quite the case today. So, airline deregulation, the government dropped the uh the two airline, the protection for the two airline policy, and you did have, New carriers come into the system, although a number of them failed in the early years. Similarly with telecommunications, uh, deregulation, this one was a government monopoly, of course, it was called Telecom, which is the, uh, ancestor if you like, of Telstra today. Telstra of course is a is a public company in the sense of being, uh, you know, it's, it's owned by shareholders, it's not a government company, um, uh, but, uh, telecom was a government monopoly. OK, back in the 1980s, so telecommunications deregulation ends telecoms uh monopoly. Optus comes onto the market as a competitor, for instance, and a number of other, uh, uh, companies come in to offer the kinds of services that previously had been monopolised by the government telecommunications Authority. The government, in fact it was a government corporation, it had been set up, it was originally a government department, it became a corporation in the 1970s, but it was government owned, so telecommunications deregulation. And then segueing quite neatly privatisation of government assets and businesses, government effectively selling off a lot of these old, these government assets that have been around for a long time. So the Commonwealth Bank, which I mentioned I think last time, it, it absorbs the debt ridden State Bank of Victoria and then the Keating government sells it off, it privatises it. So today, of course, the Commonwealth Bank, I think is the country's largest bank, isn't it? Um, and, and, and it's owned by shareholders, it's not a government, a government bank, uh, part sale of government airlines, so there's the partial, uh, privatisation of, uh, Australian Airlines, for instance, and of Qantas, OK? Um, so, uh, eventually, of course, under the, the next government, the Howard government, you'd also get privatisation of Telstra. OK OK stages, so, um, a, a selling off of, of government assets, this was about raising revenue, but it's also about taking government out of areas that many, um, Theorists, economists, uh, bureaucrats, and indeed politicians now argue government shouldn't be involved in. You can see here the elevation of the market, the elevation of the, of the which we've seen across a whole range of areas in the 1980s would continue into the 1990s. OK. Um, with, with both negative and positive consequences, with both negative, I mean some of our problems today, for instance, of electricity markets go back to some ill-considered privatisations, OK, so it, it wasn't entirely positive story by any means. Um, you also had other rather oddball schemes in some ways. There was a, um, a, uh, an idea, or more than an idea, there was a, a scheme for what was called a multi-function policy, and this was a joint venture between Australia, Australian government, business, and Japanese interests, and the Japanese government, Japanese business, and the idea was that you create this high tech city. And uh you know, various places around Australia bid for the right to host the multi-function policy, it was gonna be kind of a city of a couple 100,000 people and state of the art everything. And of course it it eventually gets mired in both controversy and the recession of the late 19 or the early 1990s. Eventually Adelaide, uh, wins the multi-function poli and it kind of ambled on into the 1990s before being the the plug was sort of pulled about 1997. Um, but it was an idea and, and very much in tune with the times. I mean, there were some quite oddball ideas attached to it, like, you know, having a, a space pad in northern Queensland that would launch satellites and all this, all this sort of stuff. There was all sorts of bizarre stuff. It was criticised from both the right and the left, so the left criticised it as some sort of, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, I guess ultracapitalism, ultra, you know, sort of, uh, Uh, a, a kind of turbocharged Japanese capitalism and the right, uh, criticised it for creating racial enclaves, you know, the idea that you sort of have some sort of Asian racial enclave in Australia and this would somehow undermine national unity and cohesion and all the rest of it. So, you know, it had its critics and all the rest of it, um. And uh eventually it came to, to naught or or very close to naught, but you can see the way in which it feeds into this idea of the late 1980s of, um, developing Australia's high tech industrial capacity. Um, this is really the overwhelming vision of the later 1980s across business, across government, particularly in government, that Australia's future would lie in high, high tech um service. And manufacturing. Now, we know we've ended up in a rather different place, but that, that's the vision that was sort of being pushed in the late 80s as a way of dealing with the kinds of problems that I've been talking about with respect to balance of trade, balance of payments. All of this was linked to the idea of Australia's enmeshment with Asia, that Australia would be much more closely integrated with Asia. It was a very important report by Ross Garnaut, economist, closely associated with the government, he was ambassador. To China for a time, and he talked about the Northeast Asian ascendancy, the fact that Australia's key economic relationships now were no longer, they were no longer with Britain, they were no longer even with the United States, that Australia's key economic relationships with Northeast Asia, that is, with South Korea, with Japan and with China, OK, so that's a a big idea of the, the late 19. Uh, 80s and it's associated with the formation of a regional economic, uh, organisation called APEC, Australia Pacific Economic Cooperation, which begins in 1989, still with us, of course, and it was very much a part of this vision. And you can see the way in which. Relatively free trade is central to this idea that Australia's integration with Asia could only occur if countries were prepared to drop protectionism, if they were prepared to actually adopt policies that would allow for relatively easy exchanges of goods. They were less um enamoured of the idea of relatively easy exchanges of people, it has to be said, which brings us to our next heading here, and that's immigration. There was a report called the Fitzgerald report by Stephen Fitzgerald, a man is still with us, uh, And uh you know, basically what Fitzgerald argued is that that there was fragile and maybe declining support for Australia's immigration policy, and that immigration policy needed to be much better aligned with Australia's economic needs. Utterly conventional idea today, isn't it? But being articulated in more sophisticated ways in the late 1980s, um, again, is very much a part of this vision that Australia would be able to draw on skilled workers from the region. Uh, and that it's immigration policy should be geared towards attracting those workers in order to promote economic efficiency, productivity and growth. Those words keep coming back during this late 1980s period, and they would dominate the 1990s. Folks, the fact that you're paying fees is also, I'm afraid, a product of this period, and it's related to everything I've been talking about. The government had a vision of you people as high tech workers who would go out, probably your little goggles, leaning over something very high tech, making exports that the world would want. That's why you're here, sitting here, racking up. Student debt via what's it called, FEE-HELP or whatever it's called these days, HECS as it was back then. The Dawkins revolution in universities in this period was, was utterly, uh, um, a part of the vision I've been talking about. It was, you read the green paper, the white paper of 1987, 1988, yes, it introduced university fees, yes, it introduced a kind of unified national system. Uh, of, of universities, but it's full of rhetoric about the importance of, of work readiness, of producing graduates who would be able to contribute to Australia's economic success. That's what it was all about. And the fees, of course, were intended to uh fuel an expansion of the system so that more people would be able to come in and, and that's exactly what happened. There was a significant expansion of numbers in the late 80s and early. Uh, 1990s, when I went to university, which is really mainly before this, I mean, a place like Melbourne University probably only had 20 odd 1000 students, for instance. Now what would it be? 60 or something. I mean, universities, this is kind of an exception in some ways, the ANU, which remains quite small, but the, the massive expansion of the university system really is a part of the process as I'm talking about here, and it's connected to those, um, economic ambitions. And um things like, you know, on the other side of the ledger to targeted welfare payments, there's a growing preoccupation by government of ensuring that if welfare was going to be paid to people that it was targeted to those, you know, very tightly to those in the most need, and this is also about these visions and economic uh efficiency, fiscal responsibility and all the rest of it. But the problems, and I've already discussed these a bit in previous lectures, the problems of the late late 80s don't go away. You've got a stock market crash in New York in 19 in October 1987 that drastically reduces share prices, but it's followed by an overheating economy, as, as the money that's still sloshing about the world is placed in what we believe to be safe. Investments such as in things like commercial property, in bank shares and things like this, and, and the result is, in fact, um, there, there's actually a stepping up of economic activity in the, you know, contrary to predictions in the immediate aftermath of those stock market crashes. I mean, Australian unemployment dips at the at the end of the 1980s down to about 6%. It had been much higher through much of the 1980s, and that is partly about the amount of money that was being invested in various, uh, as it turned out, not terribly, uh, uh, sensible places in the late 1980s. Government has a problem of a lack of policy instruments for dealing with all this. It's very heavily reliant on monetary policy now, that is interest rates, and that's how it really seeks to deal with this problem. OK, interest rates go up. To try and deal with the overheating economy, and then once there's signs that things are slowing down, they, they reduce them, but unfortunately what happens in that process is that many businesses and households go to the wall, OK, um, instead of a, a soft landing was the term that the government said it was looking for, and instead people talked about the economy snapping and and we end up in a, in a recession. There's some financial instability in the period, um, I've talked about some of the problems of the banks which extended to both state and, um, uh, you know, the trading banks, um, and one and one building society in Victoria went down, uh, owing a vast sum of money to shareholders and depositors. Um, again, poor regulation. Um, uh, there's also a debate over Asian immigration, uh, around 1988, there's some hostility, uh, which was really provoked by John Howard, um, who was leader of the opposition at the time. And there's also interesting, quite a lot of, um, uh, hostility to excessive, what was considered excessive Japanese investments in Australia. So there's some mobilisation around issues of race in this period in relation to both immigration, And uh in in investment in in a period where Japan seemed the most dynamic, uh, economy in the world, I mean, people talked about being almost imperial in its its its economic reach in the second half of the 1980s. There were widespread predictions that the Japanese economy was eventually going to overtake the US economy in its size, OK. Um, almost impossible to imagine this now because of course the Japanese economy goes into a deep, lasting stagnation from about 1990, but that's not how things were in the second half of the 1980s. It's an incredibly dynamic economy. And in 1990, Keating announces the recession Australia had to have, which was really when uh those interest rates uh increases, followed by, you know, some sudden uh decreases in interest rates essentially uh wreck a number of businesses. Businesses are unable to cope with that kind of interest rate instability, and uh, you end up with a, a very deep recession, which I'd like to talk a bit about now. So the 90s begins as the 1980s. really with a deep economic recession, a deep economic recession, a deep disappointment to a government that it held up its economic credentials in the 1980s, um, as, as a major achievement. Um, that said, there is a very, I'll show you in a moment with the figures, there's a very quick return to GDP growth. OK, so if you think of the, you know, the technical recession is what, 2 quarters of negative growth, OK, um. You know, basically the economy returns to growth relatively quickly and in fact there are even arguments that um there were miscalculations in terms of the measurement of the economy that appeared in Australia, never quite entered a technical recession, people have said, but let's leave that aside, what we do know is that the the resumption of growth is quite quick. What doesn't resume is high levels of employment. Unemployment remains very, very high during the 1990s, and I'll show you the figures in a moment. Perilously high, when I look back at it, I think, jeez, how the hell did I get a job? Uh, uh, when I look at some of the, the, I mean, we're talking about double digit unemployment rates into the mid-nineties, OK, so I'll talk about that in a moment. This is very important. Australia basically enters the kind of uh era of inflation that the United Kingdom and the United States had entered in the early 80s. Do you remember I talked about that in a previous lecture, Paul Volcker, the head of the Federal Reserve, initially during the Carter administration in the United States, then under Ronald Reagan. Um, similar things happening with the Bank of England and the Thatcher government in, uh, in the United Kingdom, they basically defeat in um, inflation through the time honoured method of doing what? Mass unemployment, you know, 3 million of them, for instance, in the United Kingdom alone. OK, Australia doesn't go down that path in the early 80s, but what's happening here? Hasn't really been engineered. They've stumbled into it, the same solution. OK, the the same solution, it's mass unemployment, a million. OK, it's the same solution. And it breaks inflation, for what? Well, you know, don't you? Because it only came back in your lifetimes recently. It breaks inflation until COVID, essentially, OK? Um, now you can celebrate that if you like, but, uh, if you're about someone my age who loses your job or your business in 1990 or 1991. Uh, you're probably not gonna be celebrating the defeat of inflation, I can assure you, cause you'll probably never work again. And the social consequences of this were devastating, absolutely devastating, and particularly for the worst affected regions, you know, you think of an Elizabeth, or a Woodville in South Australia with their deindustrialization, or think of a, You know, Wangaratta in in Victoria which has had, you know, um uh it's had, um, manufacturing and all the rest of it's all coming under pressure in this period. OK, so high unemployment, uh, inflation, greater reserve Bank independence and formal independence is granted in 1996, but the, the Reserve Bank has, um, come to occupy a more independent role within Australian economic policymaking during the 1980s, and that really comes into its own in the early 1990s in the recession, and with the adoption of what's called inflation targeting, OK, and this is the, The primary responsibility for the Reserve Bank is to keep inflation at roughly between 2 and 3%, and, and that's when this really comes in, and of course it manages mainly to achieve or it does achieve it actually over about 33 decades. Um, and you know, we could trace the, the growing policy importance of the Reserve Bank, but, um, at, you know, a, a critical turning point was the float. The Reserve Bank back in December 1983, had been a central player. In the float, it strongly favoured floating the dollar, and when that more or less worked, it gave the reserve Bank much greater um uh sway, much greater prestige as a source of advice to government, and and as a source of independent policy making. And that that really takes off from about 1983 onwards, in fact, a little bit earlier than that. The 90s is very interesting, and I mean you've got a reading for for this week that talks about productivity in a rather sceptical way from John Quiggin. Um, but the 90s is a period of rising productivity in Australia, probably the last great period of really seriously rising productivity. We might think about why that occurs, complex uh uh explanations and controversies about that, but just for the moment, let's note that it was a period where measured productivity increased. Uh, rising per capita GDP growth, OK, during, so it's not just the economy's growing, but that individual GDP growth is also growing, and that's usually a solid basis for prosperity, and in fact there is rising prosperity in the 90s if you're in employment. If you're out of luck, not so good, but if you're in employment, it's, it's, it's a good period, um, in terms of, of, of, you know, rising, um, uh, standards of living. Um, and you've also got, as often happens in a recession or depression, lower population growth for a time, right through the 90s, into the John Howard period, the Howard government, and then bang, then bang, when the economy really begins to take off in the early 2000s with the China boom. Immigration also takes off, and this time, very importantly, massively um uh uh geared towards Asian migration in the early part of this century. Any questions about that so far? Reasonably clear, is that just overview stuff for the 1990s? Let me take that a bit further. Here's some policy things, so a transition, which I've already referred to from centralised wage determination to enterprise bargaining. OK, so the, the old commissions still exist, and we've still got them. Fair Work it's called today isn't it? Fair Work commission. So it's not that they're abolished, but there's centrality to wage determination. Is displaced, they're no longer quite as important, um, the, the phenomenon of the enterprise bargain, the enterprise agreement, uh, really comes into its own, OK, in which you have unions, as I said, and, and employers. Basically bargaining together over uh um um you know, wages and, and conditions, a system that largely remains in place and then the tribunals, commissions would essentially register those agreements as they still do today. Now um uh initially the governments, It's, it's really the Keating government, Keating labour government, more or less guarantees a privileged place for the unions in, in this process, as you would expect a labour government to do. And of course when the coalition gets in, it seeks to marginalise the role of unions in that process, uh, with only limited success to begin with, but then uh it introduces much more drastic legislation. Uh, in 2005, uh, which, uh, um, you know, when it gained control of the Senate, but that's a story for, for another lecture. OK, superannuation, uh, is legislated as compulsory in 1992, it had emerged out of the accord processes that I described previously, that those agreements between the labour governments and the unions. Initially, superannuation appears in awards that unions win before the uh arbitration commission, um, but, eventually it is legislated partly as a response to, um, Court decisions that cast doubt over the legality of shoving superannuation in an industrial award, so it was partly a legislative response to legal problems or or uh legal vulnerabilities in having superannuation within awards. So, superannuation, compulsory superannuation is legislated by the Keating government. In 1992, at a very low level to begin with, I think the percentage is only a 3% employer contribution, it's very, very low. These days, I think the minimum's probably what, 12 or something, so it's, it's a much more developed system now than it was then, but, um, this is the beginnings of compulsory super. Goods and services tax, which I'll talk about briefly in a moment, but, you know, this has been kind of an elusive thing for governments for a very long time. Governments have been talking about introducing a consumption tax of some kind. Uh, really going back to the 1970s, there'd been an inquiry, a government inquiry which had, you know, sort of recommended such attacks, uh, going right back into the 1970s. Um, John Howard flirted with it briefly as treasurer in the early 80s. I mentioned, I think last time that Paul Keating, as treasurer wanted one in the mid 1980s. Uh, John Hewson, of course, very famously advocated one at the 1993 election as a part of his fight back policy. He's defeated at that election and indeed Keating, you know, high hypocrisy, having advocated the same policy a few years before, basically bangs Hewson and and the coalition over the head about it in 1993, uh, which helps him win an election. Uh, but it is finally introduced, uh, in circumstances, I'll talk about briefly in a moment in 1999, it comes into play, I think it's the first of July 2000 by the Howard government. There are continuing current account deficits. OK, Australia continues to spend more on imports than it than it is able to earn through its its exports. Um, but let me talk in a in a moment about um how that was managed. Uh, it's a period of greater uh economic stability as you get deeper into the 90s, as I've already said, relatively steady growth, a steady level of inflation, inflation is at low levels during the uh um 1990s, which promotes investment, uh which obviously gives people greater spending power, which does have some problems in terms of balance of payments. Um, smaller interest rate movements, so the swings in interest rate levels that had occurred in the late 80s are no longer, uh, in fact, it, it, you'd had them earlier in the 80s, so they're no longer a feature of the system, so greater economic stability, and Australia's economy proves relatively resilient through the end of a, a, a sort of global dot-com boom, you know, kind of tech sector boom. And then the Asian financial crisis, in fact, I've got that those the wrong way around, haven't I? The Asian financial crisis and then the, the dot-com boom. But through, you know, relatively turbulent waters, I mean the, the Asian financial crisis is Australia's own region, of course, the dot-com boom is destabilising uh across the world, but Australia, the Australian economy manages to get through both of these without a recession. And this is seen as testimony to the kinds of changes that had been undertaken during the 1980s. It it it had created a more resilient economy. Let me talk, so that's the surface level stuff, let me sort of look a bit beneath the hood now. So, you've got this recession in the early 1990s, unemployment in Australia is much worse than, say, the United States. So there you've got it. The US peaks at about a bit under 8% in mid 1992, but look at the Australian one. These are the worst levels of unemployment since the depression of the 1930s. They're worse than the recession of the early 1980s, OK? So that's late 1992 and, and worse in some places than others. Victoria was very badly hit by by unemployment. I think unemployment. So Melbourne or Victoria's up around 13% at one stage, so very high. Um, and, and you can see there the Australian, let's get rid of that, um. The Australian average uh uh unemployment for the 1990s, now look how high that is, just under 9%. That's a high rate of unemployment. Um, the 80s it was, it was a bit lower at 7.6%, but you do get signs of economic recovery from 1994 onwards. So there's the unemployment rates. I've put all this online, so I need to write it down. You can go in and have a look at it, but you can see there, look, um, uh, unemployment reaches double figures in 1992, it's very high, 193, 194, and then it does start going down, but jeez, uh. Uh, not very far, right, um, you've still got unemployment up around 9% in 1995, and right through that period of the, the second half of the 1990s, it remains pretty high, and you can see it starts to dip there more seriously around 2000 on the eve of of the China boom. OK, so high unemployment is a phenomenon of the nineties, but as you can see, the GDP grows quite significantly during the, the 90s. So you've got the recession, you can see negative, uh, period there, uh, uh, negative 0.1 over the, the whole of 1990. Very low rate of growth, essentially recession conditions in. 1991. But then look, from 1992 onwards from that low base, you're getting, um, the signs of economic recovery if GDP is a measure, and of course it's a very imperfect measure of what's happening in the economy, has its critics, and rightly so, but it gives you, uh, a kind of sense of, uh, of, of the development of an economic recovery of sorts in, uh, the 1990s. Um, and, and you can see the averages of GDP. So for the 1990s, it's 3.5%. It had been a little lower in the 80s, 1970s a little higher, but look at that 60s. So, you know, this is very much post long boom, uh, economic, uh, uh, economics. I mean, you know, we, we're not getting anything like those growth rates of the 1960s. There's inflation, and you can see it's very high uh when Australia dips into a recession still. Um but look what happens in the, in the early 90s, and you can see there, um, in that context of recession, as often happens, I mean recessions and depressions are periods of price deflation, usually, and that's what's happened there. Um, you do, and, and this was fatal to the Keating government, um, the, the return of, uh, a high level of inflation in 1995, uh, but you can see it's very quickly defeated. OK, so we, we've basically got a return to, to lower levels of inflation, and in the context of, of, you know, the Reserve Bank's inflation targeting, you can see that it's generally more or less hitting its mark. It doesn't always hit its mark, but you can see that that there's been a shift. In Uh, the, the, the, the general economic setting in terms of inflation during the 1990s. And of course, high levels of unemployment are one of the drivers of that, that the high levels of unemployment that I just showed you. Uh, as I've said, the Reserve Bank is targeting inflation between 2 and 3 through its interest rates. I'm not gonna go into all that because you've got notes from Selwyn Cornish on how that's done, so I won't, I won't harp on about that, but that just gives you an indication of how it was regulating interest rates, and you've got the mechanism described for you in the notes that Selwyn gave you uh a few uh weeks ago. What about in terms of the politics? Well, um, you know, the, the politics are a bit turbulent in this period. You've got the Hawke-Keating economic relationship, political relationship disintegrates in the late 1980s. Keating eventually displaces Hawke as Prime Minister. Great irony of course, Keating had been treasurer and the uh recession greatly weakens Bob Hawke's leadership, so. Um, you know, I suppose the principle might be if you played a role in driving the truck into the bog, maybe you're the man to drive it out. I don't know, uh, but Keating becomes Prime Minister in December 1991 at a very low ebb, as you've already seen for the Australian economy. Uh, the next contest, uh, is Keating versus John Hewson. Hewson was an academic economist. He's still here as a professor at ANU over in the Crawford School, labour versus the Coalition and Labor's, uh, economic policies called of, of all things, uh, one nation, no relationship to a Pauline Hanson, uh, but this, this was a kind of, uh, mild version of old old style Keynesianism, countercyclical spending, so the government, Spending money in order to try and pump up the economy at a time when demand was very, very weak. OK, so very traditional sort of method, but it's pretty mild, OK, we're not talking about, you know, uh, uh, radical uh pump priming or anything like that. On the other side, on the, the, the coalition side, you have this policy called fightback, which was a radical free market policy, uh, and it's released at the end of 1991, towards the end of 1991. It plays a critical role in destroying Bob Hawke's prime ministership because he he's basically unable to counter it effectively in political terms, and uh Keating replaces uh Bob Hawke as Prime Minister in December 1991, just a couple of weeks really after the release of Fight Back. I mean Fight Back had in it really the abolition of Medicare as a universal scheme. Uh, the withdrawal of unemployment benefits after 9 months, uh, and most controversially, uh, and potently a goods and services tax of 15% across the board initially, um, and it was really the goods and services tax on which Keating increasingly seized, I won't worry about that, in order to counter, um, uh, the, the threat from Hewson. Um Now, uh, what happens, uh, at the 1993 election is that uh the labour Party gets, uh, 1/5 term, basically, um, which would see it into office until 1996, and it is on the back of Keating's successful countering of the fight back policy which he presents as extreme, you know, sort of, Uh, you know, right wing free market policies, so Keating's very successful politically in sort of positioning himself in a more moderate, um, kind of place and, and as a centrist in the context of these radical free market policies that the that the Hewson, uh, lead opposition, um, but it was, it was, uh, only a temporary, uh, uh, sort of triumph really, a Pyrrhic victory in many ways because, Uh, at the 1996 federal election in March of that year, John Howard wins a landslide victory, and one of the, the things that gets him there is the claim that Australia had had 5 minutes of economic sunshine. If you go back, you can see how he's able to do that in 1995, look at it. 1995, you've got uh um inflation returns to 4.6%. You've got, uh, GDP still looks reasonably healthy, um, but, you know, it's still, uh, you know, not great, but then look at unemployment, you know, you've still got unemployment at 9%. So it's easy for, for, for John Howard and for the coalition to point to economic indicators that aren't, uh, terribly good. You can have a look at those links, uh, in your own time. Fourthly, the goods and services tax. Um, so this is, as I've said, is introduced at the end of the 1990s, uh, in economic theory, it's usually considered a quite efficient tax, um, but because it's flat, it, it's not a progressive tax like income tax, um, it, it's not, um, a terribly equitable one, OK, it hits, um, Uh, really hits poorer people more than it hits wealthier people because poorer people have less discretionary income, they're spending much more of their income on basic necessities, so, um, it's efficiency isn't necessarily matched by its equity. As I've said, it's been under discussion a long time. See there, uh, the evolution that I've already discussed. um, Howard promised when he came to office in 1996 that he wouldn't introduce such a tax, but there was a high court decision in August 1997 that ruled several existing state taxes breached the constitution. Now this was critical because it meant that the states would now be short of money. There needed to be a way of of raising money. Uh, that would, uh, it could be passed on to the states, and that's essentially what John Howard does. He goes to the 1998 election with a 10% GST as official policy. The idea is that the proceeds would go to state governments to, to fill the gap left by the, the, um, removal of various state government taxes, those that have been knocked out as illegal, more taxes. That the that the state government's promised to abolish, and the GST money would go to the states. Howard won a very narrow majority at the 1998 election which allowed, uh, the government to implement a goods and services tax, which it did. Amid some controversy and difficulty, it eventually took fresh food out, so you don't pay GST on fresh food. Um, it, but eventually it did pass the Senate, but the Australian Democrats who had the balance of power, agreed to pass it. It was introduced, uh, or came into, to, to, um, uh, operation in mid 2000. And we can argue that that was sort of the last example of substantial tax reform that we've seen in Australia, which is a rather poor effort, one would have thought, uh, for to have so many years go by without that. Um, you're also getting various forms of microeconomic and fiscal reform during the 1990s. National competition policy emerges out of the cooperation between, uh, so, you know, really agreements between the federal and state governments. Um, I've already mentioned privatisation of. Assets that continues apace in the 1990s. It gathers pace under the Howard government. You also get a lot of outsourcing or contracting out of government services, you know, employment services. Some of you might have dealt with private employer providers already, you know. Uh, private uh providers of, of, you know, support for finding a job that had previously been done by the CES, the Commonwealth Employment Service, established in the 40s, that sort of thing is being increasingly contracted out in the 1990s. You get some labour deregulation, new industrial relations legislation comes in in 1996, further development of enterprise bargaining, further tariff reductions, and also an almighty um uh conflict. I called it a dispute, it's really, it's a lockout essentially on the wolves in 1998, a bitter industrial dispute. There's been a very interesting radio documentary on it, on ABC Radio National done by one of our former students actually, um, which you might find interesting if you want to go in and listen to the full story, it's there on, uh, in, in podcast form now on the ABC's website, um, on that maritime dispute of 19. 98, which ends in a kind of stalemate, uh, in a way, um but uh certainly many, uh, uh, Workers on the wharves would lose their jobs and it it it does facilitate um a restructuring of, of the wharves. It was, it was certainly driven by this idea again of efficiency, the notion that the wharves needed to be made more efficient, and you had collusion, high levels of collusion between the government and the stevedo. to defeat the unions, including even a scheme for training non-union labour in Dubai, I think it was, ex-army people, so it's, there's a lot of skuldudgery involved and it's a very bitter dispute and you can see it's sort of spawned, you know, characters like that, guards wearing masks with dogs and all the rest of it. Um, as I've already mentioned, increasing productivity in the 1990s, uh, you can read about some of the debates on this in, in that John Quiggin piece, uh, for this week. Uh, he actually questions some of the statistics, you know, wondering how accurate they, they actually are. But it's important, I think, you know, the, the increases in productivity do seem to occur in things like wholesale trade, retail trade, construction. It's not really, you know, what the government back in the 80s had wanted, the new economy, that high tech economy. So it confound, what, what happens in the 90s in a lot of ways confounds key aspects of that vision of that kind of high tech manufacturing economy that had been um, Articulated in in the 19, 1980s and you know, you also get greater efficiencies around utilities and mining, but not really manufacturing, which is where the government's intention actually lay. Uh, I won't worry about sectoral shares here. The last thing I wanted to do, we're almost out of time, I just wanted to take, I won't worry about that, we'll come back to that. This one, which I think is quite important, and this is the whole idea of current account deficits, and you can read that, I'm actually gonna go on this one. You can go back to this online and have a look. One of the things that happens in the later 80s, and this had been building up in economic theory for some time, was um a questioning of the significance of the balance of payments as a measure of the health of the economy. OK, and this became known as the Pitch thesis after John Pitchford, an economist of this university, some of you might be taught by Rowan, are you? Any of you taught by Rowan Pitch, who's his son, also an economist here. Now what this is called, what John Pitchford developed was called the consenting adults theory of um balance of payments, and what this argued is that once you have floating exchange rates, OK, and the debt now is largely private. Australia's debt, you know, predominantly in the 1980s, is not a public or government debt, unlike in 1930, it's a private debt. Once you're in that world, floating exchange rates, private debt, current account deficits, balance of payments deficits are not necessarily a problem. Because in the aggregate, what is happening there is that lots and lots and lots of households and businesses are looking at their own situation, they're looking at the economy, and they're basically saying, Alright, if I go into debt, I'll be able to pay it back later. Now you might say, well, people make mistakes, yes, of course they do, but this is about aggregates, this is about the whole economy. OK, if you've got thousands and thousands and thousands of decisions of that sort being made, the argument goes, That um it's, it's lowering the level of risk across the economy. The these are basically, it's, it's based on the concept of people exercising a rational judgement about their economic decisions, not each and every individual, but in the aggregate. So it's, that's why it's called the consenting adults theory. So a current account deficit involves households spending on the basis that they'd be able to pay debt back later. Businesses would borrow and they'd invest on the basis that they would generate sufficient earnings and profits to be able to service their debts. This is very different from a government debt, because this is happening across thousands and thousands and thousands of decisions, not simply a government making one decision. And so the result, it was argued was likely to be economic growth. OK, the result of all these rational decisions being made about the capacity of people to take on debt would would actually produce economic growth. Now, this is absolutely transformative during the 1990s, this idea. You could not walk down to the news agent without basically reading something front page of the paper in the 19.
