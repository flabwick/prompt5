SPEAKER 1
Right, good, we can start, uh, so, um, my acknowledgements of tradition to traditional owners, uh, Nannawar Namri and pay my respects to people, elders, and country. Uh, the rural economy, for want of a better title for the, the lecture, um, it will range a little bit more broadly than that, but I'm particularly, uh, preoccupied today with, um, the development of an export economy, um, especially in Australia, and, uh, That has predominantly been a rural economy, although of course various aspects of the services economy in Australia that have supported um the the rural economy are in fact urban and sometimes metropolitan, so it's a slightly more complex picture than I think is suggested by the title. Um just before I get into it, most of you, was there anyone uh at this lecture now who wasn't at the lecture last night? Anyone in that. So just, just a reminder that next Monday at 10 a.m. we have an excursion for those of you who are available and would like to come to the Noel Butlin Archive centre, which is just here, basically next door in the Menzies library, so the big library over here, uh, so we just meet in the, the foyer of the Menzies library at 10 a.m. And it's really Australia's largest archives uh of business and labour, so particularly you know it's essentially a specialised economic history collection, although with a wider remit um than that, uh, and Sarah Lethbridge over there will be taking us through some of the collections, you can get a sense of the resources available on campus, which I think we're all inclined to underestimate to have an archive like that on, on, Our own campus is uh incredibly, uh, a great privilege, I think, um, but also it'll give you a sense of the kinds of materials that economic historians work with. OK, so you get the products in many ways when you're looking at those statistical series and when you're looking at, uh, you know, journal articles and book chapters and books, but, you know, what kinds of primary sources are they using, you know, when we have all those figures about economic growth and wage theories and all the rest of it. Where do they come from? Um, well, the answer is that they've been built up over an enormous period of time, and many of them were developed, you know, with primitive computer technology, for instance, in the 1950s and 1960s, so you'll get a sense of how knowledge has been built in Australian economic history if you can make it between 9 and 10:30. Uh, if you can't stay for the whole 90 minutes, that's OK too. Um, I'm sure Sarah won't mind if you have to leave early for some other appointment. Uh, sorry, not night, 10 and 11:30, I should say, 10 and 11:30. So the Menzies Library and the archives, which is at the back of it, opens at 10 a.m. and that's when our excursion is next Monday, um, which is the, what's Monday, it's the 3rd, or whatever it is. Monday, the 3rd of March, 10 a.m. OK, so let's get into today's, um, Today's class, um. I, I talked last night in the lecture about um the emergence of a trading economy, really, and the, the development of a kind of merchant class in uh New South Wales in particular, in the period between 1788 and about 1800. And in many ways, um what has been called the Rum Rebellion, um, or the Bligh Rebellion on the 26th of January 188, brought many of the emerging conflicts to a head. I mean, in some ways it registers the fact that this is now an emergent capitalist economy in New South Wales, but with a political order, who is doing Australian political history at the moment, or has done it in the past with me, anyone? Uh, we've been looking at this from a political point of view in that course, and the, the, the political structures of New South Wales and and Van Diemen's Land are despotic. Um, there's no political institutions in the sense of assemblies or councils, uh, there's no sort of exec cabinets, none of those sorts of things. It's, it's really a kind of personal rule by a governor, by a single individual, it all seemed very un-British to many people. Um, now the reasons for that are complex, and I don't have time to go into them here and they're not really strictly relevant to, uh, an economic history course. But the point about this is you've got an emerging conflict between a kind of capitalist economy, uh, where, uh, entrepreneurs in it want the freedom to make big profits, although they want to do it with the assistance of governments, of course, and with things like government contracts, um, so you've got that on the one side and on the other side you've got a political order. That doesn't look very amenable to that kind of economic freedom and that kind of uh uh economic activity, and that's really what comes to a head when Governor Bligh is overthrown on the 26th of January 1808 because those overthrowing him were the military officers, but really led by an ex-military officer called John MacArthur, who is rich. He is very rich by this time, he's become a major landowner, a merchant. And uh he wants to make more money, uh, again, he's he's beginning the development of the wool industry too, as I'll talk about in a moment. That's a piece of propaganda, of course, which is presenting Bligh as a coward, you know, hiding under the bed in the back room when the, when the, uh, um, uh, soldiers come to arrest him and uh uh in fact it's an invented image, um. Uh, you know, you're all familiar with political propaganda, I'm sure, from social media and memes and all the rest of it. Well, here's an example from, uh, the early 19th century, the early 1800s. Um, the, the reasons for the Rum Rebellion, uh, I mean, it's very, uh, deceptively called the Rum Rebellion, rum or liquor has almost nothing to do with it. There was a kind of, there has been an impression that, um, You know, the, the business interests that the uh military officers and MacArthur were attempting to protect was a trade in liquor. Well, yes, that was an element, but this wasn't overrun. Um, Bligh essentially supported the smaller settlers, often ex-convicts, such as those who were beginning to form farms or had formed farms along the Hawkesbury, often in a context of growing violence, uh, between, uh, indigenous people and, um, uh, those colonisers, those, those farmers. Probably some of you are familiar with the Secret River, you know, Kate Grenville's book, the novel The Secret River, so that's set in in in in that particular part of the world, in that period. Um, but others saw Bligh's actions, such as his effort to control, um, or assert control over urban land, which was being used for housing and for commercial purposes as a threat to private enterprise. So basically what Bligh started doing, he'd started asserting the crown's control over land that people had just built stuff on, you know, so there's very um rough and ready kind of disposal of land and people, um, businesses, sometimes households would just build, they build a warehouse or they build a factory or a workshop or a house on a piece of land that they had no real title to. And what Bligh was attempting to do was to essentially assert the government's control over that land and not not not surprisingly, that got up the noses of especially powerful commercial interests who were having their property seized from them, OK, and that seems that's one of the recent interpretations of um the grievance uh at the heart of, of the overthrow of of Governor Bligh in 1808. There were other issues as well. This kind of coup, Um, was not unprecedented by any stretch of the imagination. He'd had this kind of turbulence, for instance, in British North America, um, before the, the, the American Revolution, before the war of independence, so it's not, um, an unusual thing. I mean it's kind of in that, that sort of uh tradition. So Bligh's overthrown and, uh, there's an interregnum, essentially a kind of military regime in in New South Wales, Bligh, And initially he's allowed to to sail back to Britain, but instead, as soon as he's out of Sydney harbour, he goes off to Tasmania to place himself uh with David Collins down there and made a nuisance of himself. Collins didn't really appreciate that visitor, uh, having effectively his boss, but now discarded, overthrown boss, come to sort of live with him down in Hobart, you can imagine how well that went down, I'm sure those of you who work probably. I understand that you don't really necessarily want your boss to come and live with you, particularly if he's just been sacked, kind of, which is really what what had happened here. But anyway, after all that, uh, Bligh does go back to to Britain, there are court martials, there are um trials of some of those who'd overthrown him, but they basically get away with it. They basically get away with it. I mean, the Major Johnson who was uh the the principal officer who'd um been involved was cashiered. But essentially, um, is able to continue his business interests and so on, and John McArthur is sent back for trial and instead he uses his time in Britain to butter up his patrons, uh, get investors interested in New South Wales, and to use his connections to help develop the wool industry. So, so much for, for, for crime and punishment, I guess they they basically got away with it. Um, but the British government's determined this isn't gonna happen again, and so it appoints Lachlan Macquarie as a replacement for Bligh, he arrives in the colony in 1810, and in, in some very empowered governor, OK, so, you know, very, uh, lots of discretionary power. Um, and he, he, he ruled, um, you know, in a very personal, uh, sort of way for about over, as you can see there, over a decade. Now, I won't go into this in enormous detail, but you can see just from the list there that this is a period of really significant and growing economic activity. I mean, have a look at it. You've got many emancipists, ex-convicts setting up a small agriculturalists, small farmers, as I just mentioned, the settlements along the Hawkesbury being a prime example. Uh, the beginnings of the wool industry of which more in a moment. Small scale manufacturing is beginning, so Simeon Lord, a fabulously wealthy ex-convict, is setting up manufacturing enterprise as well as trading enterprises. The beginnings of coal mining, black coal mining in Australia in Newcastle in the 1790s, you need energy to power even a pretty primitive economy, um, so coal is, is, um, being mined, uh, north of, of Sydney. Uh, and I'll talk about that in much more detail in a later lecture. The emergence of trade in the region with Asia and the Pacific, pork, sandalwood, uh, sealing and whaling, again, more of that in a moment, didn't really take off until the 1820s with um, The the the East India Company, which has a kind of trading monopoly in the region, and that's a barrier to merchant activity. So a lot of the traders in New South Wales are operating on the fringes of the law when they bring cargoes in from Calcutta to Sydney, for instance. They're essentially busting a a government approved monopoly. OK, so, but uh that that monopoly is being eroded in the early part of the 20 19th century, um, the early 1800s. Now a really strong emphasis on Macquarie's rule is the building up of public infrastructure. He is using convict labour in a very direct way as essentially government employees to build Sydney, to build infrastructure, so public buildings with convict labour. He even puts one convict, Francis Greenway, to work as an architect because he had qualifications and skills in that area and and of course Greenway's, um some of Greenway's productions are still uh um. You know, in the Sydney landscape, road building really takes off with the most significant of those roads, what's called Cox's Road over the Blue Mountains. Again, it's a government contract. Cox wins the government contract. Cox was the paymaster of he'd been the paymaster of the New South Wales Corps, has become a landowner. He got in trouble for investing. The the money that he was administering, uh, I mentioned this yesterday, I think, and he lost, he lost it, he lost the whole, you know, pile of public money and, and that's when he uh was subjected to some uh punishment, suspension, but again, he got away with it, they all get away with it, these characters. So Cox got away off it and wins a government contract to build the road over the Blue Mountains. You also get the emergence of a recognisably modern monetary system in this period. So, uh, there's a Greenway production, probably some of you have visited Hyde Park Barracks in Sydney, have you? It's been, you know, beautifully preserved and turned into a museum over the last 20 or 30 years, uh, they're in, uh, down near the State Library in the parliament, down in Macquarie Street. Um, so Francis Greenway, um, design, um, and the emergence of currency and banking, so there's no, there's no mint in the colonies, so you're gonna have to import coinage, and, uh, Macquarie imports Spanish coinage. Uh, you may have seen have you seen these in museums occasionally, they're very, if you've got one at home, look after it, they're very valuable. Um, so the, the, the dollar, they're Spanish dollars, and they punched out the middle bit, so the they're called holy dollars, coin collectors are right into this stuff, uh, holy dollars, and the bits in the middle are called dumps, um, and, uh, they, they had, you can see there, they had different, um, denominations, and, and, and, You know, um, thousands of these were imported into the colony to to function as a local coinage. Other coinage also circulated, you know, so, um, it's beginning to be used, coins are being used as a medium of exchange, and with this innovation, uh, so we're talking here, what's this about 1816 from memory, so right in the middle of the Macquarie period, a a a government approved coinage, and this is new. OK, I talked last night about the, the proliferation of paper of IOUs of primitive checks of bills of exchange, but here we have the emergence of coinage, and with that, also the formation of the colony's first bank, still with us, Westpac. OK, the Bank of New South Wales, as you can see there, it had its bicentenary just a few years ago, and uh there's a, there's a banknote, an early banknote from the Bank of New South Wales, um. And uh bank notes were not issued by government for many, many years until the 20th century. OK, so banknotes, even right through the 19th century, early 20th century, uh, so these are issued by banks. That's why they're called banknotes. OK, the government only started doing it in Australia, what, 1911? OK, so quite late, but, but paper money is is essentially issued by banks. So if you want a kind of a something that looks like official paper money for the most part, you get, you have to have banks to do it with, and, and other banks very soon followed, but the Bank of New South Wales was, um, the earliest. And look, again, you know, we've talked so often already about the role. of government, the elevated role of government in Australia, and the government has its fingers all over this. This is not really a private venture. I mean, it sort of looks a bit like a private venture because you've got private citizens sponsoring it, but it's done entirely with government encouragement, government support, and indeed even some government resources, OK, so. This is very much a product of Macquarie's rule. Macquarie was a Scotsman, by the way. He's the first of the governors who comes from the army, rather than the navy, and this matters. It matters enormously. He comes to New South Wales as a military commander. Why did they need a military commander in 1810, do you think? Why did the British think they needed one of them? There's no threat really from abroad by that stage, the French are very much in, I mean, naval powers shot to pieces after the Battle of Trafalgar, a few years before. Why do they need uh uh um do you think a military, yes it's all, it's it's about indigenous people and he functions in New South Wales like a general. He functions like a, there's been a lot of work in recent years. He basically uh discussing Macquarie as a military commander. Prosecuting frontier warfare, in fact, even calling it frontier warfare is a misnomer because it's all over the place, not along a a frontier. Um, against indigenous people, OK, so, you know, this, this is the moment where it really I think becomes seriously possible to talk of, of, of warfare. Um, in fact, warfare had been going on really since the 1790s, but now you've got someone who's effectively an army leader, a military commander, and that's how he functions. Please, if you've got any questions, pipe up. OK, now, Um, what I want to talk about here is the emergence of the, of, of, um, what has been called a staple. I'll come to it to the concept of a staple in a moment, but I'm gonna begin with whaling. Now I'm sure who is doing Bachelor of Economics and actuarial studies and accountancy? I bet you you didn't think that there'd be any stage during your degree that you'd be sitting here listening to a kind of overweight, middle-aged man, talking about whaling. Did you? There was no moment where that even occurred to you, it didn't cross your mind, even once, well, you're about to hear it. Here we go, whaling. Um, whales mattered a lot, uh, at this time, and they mattered because they were incredibly rich in a range of products. If you killed a whale, you didn't just get one product, they had a bunch of products that were used for a whole range of purposes. OK, they're an immensely rich resource. Uh, it provided strategically important products, especially oil, the oil that you would use to light a gas lamp, for instance, uh, you know, a lamp, an oil lamp, as they were called, um, so, uh, used for those sorts of purposes, um, but there are a whole bunch of other things, the, the bones were used, like the, the, um, uh, yeah, the sort of whale bone is used for a whole range of things, including in fashion. OK, there's a, there's a whole range of purposes that white whales are used for. Now there are different types of whaling, there's deep sea whaling, you know, famously on those, those, um, You know, Shit, I think of Moby Dick, a novel, American novel, but also shore-based whaling, whaling stations, OK, coastal, uh, settlements effectively. Um, and what you get in the early, um, uh, 19th century, all along the south coast of Australia on islands, sometimes on the coasts of these little, almost like little isolated republics of whalers. They're multiracial, multicultural, you had black Americans, you had white Americans, you had West Indians, uh, you, you, you, you had, You know, uh, British migrants, yeah, the whole lot in these little isolated, almost self-governing, often quite violent settlements. They've abducted indigenous women, so Tasmanian indigenous women are brought all the way over to Kangaroo Island just off the coast of South Australia as essentially partners for these whalers. OK? So this is happening in the Early part of the 19th century before there are any formal settlements in that part of the world. There's no Melbourne, there's no Perth, there's no Adelaide. These are all happening, you know, uh, essentially, almost under the, the, the radar, as if there was a radar, but, uh, these artificial um uh settlements by any stretch of the imagination. OK, they're informal settlements. Um, United States whalers were increasingly dominant globally. Um, taxes on whale products, uh, being imported into Britain discouraged Australian whaling, um, but these were reduced and prices climbed in the 1820s and 1830s. In this period, uh, whaling is Australia's major export industry. It looks like it could become the staple. OK, the staple, and I'll, I'll, as I said, I'll discuss that concept in a moment. basically it means the staple is a kind of single product on which an economy relies very heavily, a staple, a driver of the whole economy, and it looked like whaling in partnership with sealing, but whaling was the big one, could become the staple in this period. It's incredibly important and lucrative, and of course you can think of all the industries that would grow up around whaling. You know, the, the supplies that were required, for instance, shipping of quite obviously, and, and a whole range of kind of ancillary types of, of activities that were required to um uh host a whaling industry. Whaling also, I talked a bit about this sort of thing last night. Whaling reduced the cost of convict transportation as instead of empty ships, you had whale products, lucrative uh whale products being sent back in convict ships once they'd delivered their convict, uh, cargo, their cargo of people to uh Sydney or Hobart or wherever they were going. Um, as I said, it stimulates shipbuilding, creates demand for supplies, the whalers have to be fed. Um, and whaling and sealing both employed Aboriginal labour. OK, again, it's one of those moments where Aboriginal labour is drawn into the colonial economy, and we'll talk more about some other examples of that later, not, not so much today, but in other, other lectures. Um, whaling was more valuable than wool as an export until the mid 1830s. It's not very it's still not very widely known, it's been known actually by historians for a long time. But um whaling, I mean that that phrase, riding on the sheep's back, and Australia is the the great producer of fine wool. That takes off in the 1820s, but it has to overcome the dominance of whaling before it actually happens. Um, the other industry, much more precarious was sealing, and again, um, those communities down on the, the, the sort of southern edges of the Australian continent and, and, and, uh, parts of, you know, you know the strait, you know, islands in the the Bass Strait and so on, um, we were also engaged in ceilings, so sometimes whaling, sometimes sealing. There were ceiling grounds as you can see there, Bass Strait, New Zealand, Macquarie Island between the mainland and Tasmania. Um, They uh beat uh seals to death with their clubs for their skins and oil. This is a brutal uh uh industry. Uh, it required less capital than whaling, so it was easier for for smaller groups of men to engage in sealing. Uh, there were fewer restrictions on the exports, but the industry was dying by the 1830s, and, and that was due to overexploitation. And so again and again of course, in economic history we find particular resources is what happened to whaling, of course, in due course. Uh, being basically, uh, driven out of business cause they, uh, took everything that was worth having, you know, it wasn't a sustainable form of industry. OK, so whaling and sealing are both really significant in these early decades of British uh colonisation in Australia. Now let me talk about the Staples theory. This is actually like it's an economic theory, it was developed by an economic historian, a Canadian called Harold Innes. Uh, this is, this is basically, you know, sort of the early decades of the 20th century, and he was writing about Canadian history, not Australian, but basically his argument was that Canadian development was driven by a series of staples, products that were developed for export, critical to Innes's argument was the fur trade, which I mentioned last night in the Canadian context. OK, now, this raises the question, can we apply a Staples theory to Australia? Is it a valid way of thinking about how an economy develops? And I think in some ways, the accounts you have in McLean, people begun hopefully reading Ian McLean's Why Australia prospered. Although he wouldn't see it that way, I think he places a great deal of emphasis in that book on staples. I mean, if you actually read the book carefully, you'll notice that staples, particular exports play a really significant role in the argument that he develops about why Australia prospered, why the economy grew and um why it was a relatively successful economy. So this um raises the question of whether a staples theory can be applied to Australia, and as we'll talk about in a moment, it it does seem to have some validity because, you know, you move from really important role of whaling through to a a a really a period in which wool has a predominant role from sort of the mid 1830s to about the early 1850s, and then you have a 20 year period in which gold is the most important export through to about 1870, 1871. Then wool overtakes it again, and then there's a brief period, I think in the early 20th century when minerals sort of overtake wool, not for very long, um, and then of course a long sort of period in which wool is the predominant, uh, export, uh through to what about the end of the 1970s in which black at which point coal overtakes it. So you, you can see that, You know, there is perhaps something to be said for for considering the role that a particular staple can play. There's never any moment, of course, where these a single product is the only one being exported. OK, even in the in the heyday of wool, you know, in the, the, the 20th century. you had wheat, wheat was a major, Australia was a major producer of wheat. Uh, increasingly after the First World War, it would export sugar and you can think of a whole range of things, uh, mineral exports never really stopped, you know, from copper in the 1840s through to, Uh, you know, iron ore and bauxite and all the rest of it today. So there's always several, but the, the idea of a staple is, is there a product that's so dominant as an export that it's actually a driver, that it helps to explain the broader shape and course of the economy. And so that's kind of what we're testing here. Now, there's a kind of variation, I think, on Staples theory that's put by a historian called James Belich. Um, he, he wrote a book called Replenishing the Earth about 15 odd years ago, New Zealand historian originally. And Balich's argument's slightly different, I think more convincing. What Balich argues is that in fact, during the periods when economies through what he calls the Anglo world, Australia would be an example, so would Canada. During the period where these economies are really booming, staples actually aren't terribly important. They're not terribly important in the overall growth of the economy. He argues that the driver is really a kind of animal spirit. That is often very urban based, that's based on investment in cities, in construction, in things like railways, it's highly speculative, and it always ends in one way. How does it end? It always ends in the same way, it busts every single time. It always busts because you get overinvestment. OK, land prices go too high, share prices go too high, it becomes increasingly speculative, people think they can make money by buying up land over here and of course it collapses and they're left with, Miserable assets and huge bills and all the rest of it, but he argues this is initially a huge driver of things like urbanisation. So if you want to understand the development of, say, a Melbourne, rapid development of Melbourne in the 1850s, 160s, 1970s, 980s, yeah, of course gold plays some role in all that, it's, it is a trigger undoubtedly. But gold can only take you so far. The development of Melbourne in the 1860s and 1870s depends heavily on urban investments and urban construction, building, the role of government, um, in, in taking out loans and building infrastructure. OK, so it it it's, it's not, it's an alternative if you like, to Staples' theory that's much more um but based on the domestic economy, really, on domestic spending and investment rather than than exports. But then he says, once the bust has happened, that's when the staple comes into its own. OK, if you want to understand how the recovery occurs after one of these big busts, like, for instance, um, you know, the bust that occurs in in New South Wales in the 1840s, or the bust that occurs right through eastern Australia in the 1890s, or indeed the, the, the 1930s depression, um, the staple then comes into its own and it plays a really important role in the recovery of the economy. OK, it's kind of export rescue, so the staple comes to the rescue of a depressed, busted economy. So that that's the Balich argument, which is kind of variation, I think on this. So there are two theories, and, and you might want to think about those two versions as we look at some of the, the sort of economic periods, uh, as we will in in the next few weeks. Is that reasonably clear? OK, those, those ideas are staple theory from uh Innes and that kind of variation from Bali, which, which says the staples come into their own only at a particular moment. It's when the economy's stuffed, basically, it's when after the economy is stuffed and then it helps to rebuild it. Yeah Something very valuable. So the, sorry the uh they have to be a staple to to be a staple, to be a a um a valid or um viable export has to be um marketable in a distant place for Australia anyway, um I mean there there was some regional trade, particularly in the early years, but, What I'm about to talk about with wool is this is integration into an imperial economy. The wool has to be sent back to Britain, where it's going to be turned into woollen cloth. Now to do that, you have to be able to transport it economically. OK, um, we can't export water to another country, why? Because it's not valuable enough to export, it would take up vast amounts of of of space on a ship. You can't do it. Gold, on the other hand, very small amounts of gold, worth a fortune, there's never any question about the viability of gold as an export.wo sort of sits in between. OK, wool's quite compact, once it's placed in in bales, so it was, it could be economically transported and placed on the market in the period we're about to talk about. So yes, the economics of transport in particular are very important. External transport but also of course getting it to the port in the first place, you have to be able to get whatever product it is from the hinterland, wherever you've grown it to a port from where it can be exported, so that's also very important in in all this. OK, um, so let me talk a bit about wool, and often John McArthur, who I've already talked about, um, you know, the ringleader really in the, the Rum Rebellion, is credited with the development of the wool industry. There you can see him. I don't think there'd be anyone here old enough to remember one of them. Maybe you've seen them around. Even our tutors aren't old enough to remember those, yeah. So that's an old Australian $2 banknote, and you can see both a sheep and John McArthur sitting on the front of it there. Um, there's our former Chancellor as the signatory I notice, HC Coombs, the governor of the Reserve Bank, but, um, actually his wife Elizabeth plays a critical role, because remember what I told you before, where did um uh John McArthur spend several years after 1808? OK, in Britain, awaiting trial and punishment that never really happened for his role in the Rumrabas. He's over there for years. He's gone for years and and and it's Elizabeth McArthur, his wife is developing the, the, the family's holdings and and and developing uh wool as a viable export on those holdings, so. Um, this is another example of women's entrepreneurship, which I referred to in relation to Mary Reby for instance yesterday. OK, it's often connected to a marriage, but women do play, uh, uh, an independent role. They are economic agents in the story being told here. So there's the Australian Merino, legendary kind of um where is it? Goulburn, isn't it? There's a big one at Goulburn, you can go down the pub, we should have an excursion, wouldn't that be great? We could all, you know, hire a bus and head down to Goulburn for the big merino. And you can see there, uh that's a a stamp I think uh oh jeez, I can't even remember, you'd have to look it up, but a stamp of the mid 20th century, and you can see there that, you know, celebrating the Merino sheep as as it was also celebrated on the $2 decimal note. Um, This was a significant moment, again, it's a kind of part of a mythology, and that's an 1880 image of an 1813 event, the crossing of the Blue Mountains by William Lawson, Greg Gregory Blaxland, and William Charles Wentworth, who would go on to other more famous things. Um, and convicts, very importantly, so they find a pathway through the Blue Mountains in 1813, as I said earlier, Cox's Road is constructed from 1815, so directly after this, and it provides a way, a a relatively passable way through to the Bathurst Plains on the other side of the mountain. Opening up the pastoral industry. Now there's been a whole, you know, kind of literature now in the Blue Mountains, the, the passageway was almost certainly penetrated by convicts well before then. It had been used by indigenous people of course for millennia, they knew ways through the Blue Mountains, um. So, you know, there's a kind of colonial legend around this, but you can see the way in which it fits into a progress narrative, a narrative of, of, of colonisers making the land productive by developing the wool industry. You can see the mythology going on behind this economic history here, banknotes, stamps, uh heroic images of that kind of looking, I mean. He's he's a real visionary, you can tell cause he's looking out. And so on, but yeah, they they have they they they're accompanied by convicts, they're they're not really a part of the legend, and as I said, indigenous people are important to the story of the um, Of the penetration of those mountains as well, um, Cox's Road I've already mentioned, so there's some um modern, um, memorials to it, markers, um, there are bits of it that you can, you know, you can still see, um, so it has heritage it's been heritage preserved, and, uh, it's built very quickly with convict labour, uh, in that middle of Macquarie period, 1815. Now this is a really critical turning point in the story of early colonial Australia. It's the big report. John Thomas Big, JT Big, um, was essentially a figure who went around the empire collecting information for the government back in Britain, and Macquarie and New South Wales's turn came round. Uh, now I'm sure as you're all aware, those of you rent properties, uh, it's, it's, it's always uncomfortable, isn't it, when the real estate agent comes to inspect. And that's really what Big was doing, he came out to the colony, uh to New South Wales, to Van Diemen's Land, to inspect it, and there'd been a lot of complaints about Macquarie, he was spending, Too much money uh on public works, he was wasting convict labour on buildings that were supposedly monuments to his own vanity. Uh, he was too lenient towards convicts. Uh, he was too lenient in giving them, uh, pardons in, in allowing them access to civil society, to ordinary civil life after their sentences had expired, so there's a whole bunch of complaints, and what Big does is an elaborate, An elaborate inquiry into the colony, which of course has been a goldmine for historians for decades, cos, the documents survive, you know, of this inquiry, so it's a huge investigation, really the whole society and it's in its various aspects, OK. And he, he comes up with um a particular set of recommendations that were effectively a slap across the the the face really from Macquarie because he says, He says basically the future of this colony lies with the wool industry, that's been shown by the experiments done by the likes of MacArthur. The wool industry is is the way this colony is gonna come to pay for itself, and the key to this, he said, is punishment and profit, that is, it would be a good way of punishing convicts, but it would also make the colony profitable through an export trade. And so what was called the assignment system. Was going to be used to underpin this order and that basically involved convict labour being placed at the disposal of wool growers, OK, so they'd be shepherds. I mean there's no fences, there's no fences, so you need quite a bit of labour to be able to run an industry of this kind. And so convict labour would be good for developing the wool industry, but what a better way of reflecting on your misspent life and all the horrible things you'd done to end up in New South Wales than to be a shepherd, sitting under a tree in quiet the isolation of the bush, where you could reflect on the mistakes you'd made in your life, um. That was also a very important part of the process, that this would be about punishment but also reforming the character of these convicts, um, so punishment and profit. But this is a real capitalist term in the in the economy. It's basically saying we're gonna have a convict penal settlement, but it's gonna be a penal settlement, it's gonna pay for itself through the wool industry, through fine wool, and it's gonna make profit for individuals, it's gonna be profitable for the empire. So that idea had been around, as I said last night, since the 1780s, that you could make New South Wales profitable for empire, but finally they seem to have alighted on the way to do it, fine wool. On those huge tracts of land that had often been managed so expertly by indigenous people. So wool was sometimes thrown out before 1820 sheep were wanted for their meat. Remember this was a colony that it had some difficulty feeding itself from time to time. But wool had many advantages as a staple export. I've already talked about one. You get those nice compact bales that could be economically transported back to Britain. So it's non-perishable, it's not gonna go off. OK, it's not gonna go off, high value per weight size, which is the point I've already made, low labour demand except in shearing, so you needed labour, you needed shepherds to look after those sheep because you didn't have fences, but the, the really intense um demand for labour was seasonal during the shearing season. Fairly low on technology, modest capital because the, the sheep reproduce themselves. OK, you just shove them out there, they, they eat the grass and uh you know, get up to sheep business with one another. Of Boy sheep and girl sheep, and then you have lambs, terrific, what a what a great way of growing an industry. Um it was suited to the land's native grasses, to its open spaces, and uh to the limited fertility of the country, which seemed to militate against cropping in a lot of places. And the size of flocks, as I've said, grew naturally. Now, disadvantages, well, obviously, particularly for indigenous people, they had their land taken away and they were murdered, they were killed. Uh, so frontier conflict and violence. You have environmental degradation, um, uh, you know, obviously damage to, to, to land that had been expertly managed by indigenous people for millennia as as Boyd told us in our last lecture in here last week. Um, you're reliant on international prices for wool, this is the casual, this is the problem of any export economy. OK, prices bounce around in ways that they do not for manufacturing goods. OK, prices bounce around and that makes you vulnerable, that makes you vulnerable to changing uh uh patterns of demand. Uh vulnerable eventually of course, also to changing technologies in the 20th century as substitutes for wool proliferated. Um, you were reliant on overseas capital. This was not an industry that could somehow be developed, um, from local capital resources. There simply wasn't enough capital available locally, um, in the, in the early years, especially. Um, and labour supply was difficult, especially after convict transportation ended in, uh, New South Wales in 1840. How did you persuade, uh, people, and you're mainly talking about men. To go out and work in isolated areas for for relatively low wages, um, although they were able to demand higher wages because labour was in short supply, so getting labour out to where you needed it was difficult. I mean it's a, it's a hard life, um, in a very isolated area subject to attacks by indigenous people, you know, it was a threat to your own person. So Brian Fitzpatrick, economic historian of the 1930s and 1940s, the Australian economy came hitched to a wool wagon. I like that phrase. Um, but, as happens with, uh, these sorts of uh exercises, um, often in the early years you had a bust. OK, so in the early 1840s Australia has its first depression, really significant depression. wool prices declined in London, there was an excess of supply, overproduction. And for a while their sheep was simply being boiled down for their tallow because you boil them down, you can make candles out of the remains, and so yeah, it really stinks, um, but, uh, these works developed to, um, to deal with the sheep that couldn't be fed, uh, that couldn't be shorn economically and uh, and so that's what happened for a few years in the, particularly the early 1840s. Um, the wool industry gives rise to the phenomenon of squatting. Now, the colonists had this idea which they took from a theorist in Britain. He was an absolute scoundrel called, uh, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and he wrote a, um, a, a, a, um, I'll just give you there, he wrote a thing called Letter from Sydney in 1829, but he wrote it not from Sydney, he wrote it from prison because he'd been, um, placed in prison for stealing, A 15 year old heiress. Now those of you who read Jane Austen know what I'm talking about. Uh, you know, a young blade would go and elope with a young woman, and of course by then she was ruined. She was ruined. But you, um, because you had ruined her, you could get her family to pay you off, uh, or they'd force a marriage, and so you, you could basically get access to the, the dowry that probably attached. So this is why, um, Edward Gibbon Wakefield was in jail. But he was a theorist. He was a theorist of colonisation. He comes up with this idea, complex idea that basically involved you set price of land at a, at a certain level that would prevent really poor people from buying it, and they'd be a labour supplier. Um, but what you would do, you'd set it at a level that would concentrate settlement in a particular area. OK, and so you'd only sell land in a certain area. And this was called the limits of location, the 19 counties, and so this was where you could legally buy land. Remember, most land up to this point's been, uh, granted. This is the moment where they start in the 1830s, they start buying, government starts buying, uh sorry, selling land to to to people for, for pastoralism and agriculture. So you could buy land here and it was set at a price that you really need to be quite well off to be able to buy it, um. And the idea was that you'd limit the settlement to area. Now you can imagine how well that went. If you've got land there that you have to buy and then you've got land out here where there's kind of, you know, no evidence of government anywhere, but you can get it for nothing. What do you think happened? Well, of course, people took their sheep and their cattle and went out beyond the limits of location and they allowed their their their sheep and cattle to basically fatten on the grasses out there, uh, which again had often been managed by indigenous people for their own economic purposes. These people were called squatters, and it's a very pejorative term originally, I'm sure you're familiar with the term squatter. It's a pejorative term, the squatters were those who took up land unlawfully, illegally outside the limits of location. OK, they basically just seized the land and ran their, their cattle and sheep on it, and of course you could make fortunes quite quickly doing this. Very low capital expend. They often lived in bark huts. So it's not, they're not developing the properties to any great extent in the early years, but you know, you fatten those cattle, you, you know, get a, a, a, a, a year or two of wool from. Find wool from those sheep, you can make a fortune. OK, and so that's really what squatting was all about. I won't labour Wakefield. The proceeds from land, by the way, were to be used to assist immigration. OK, so you'd pay people essentially to come out to Australia with the money that you got from selling land. OK, that was how the whole thing was supposed to work. Now the problem um with limits location, as I've said, um, is that people basically went outside them, there were vast profits to be made, it was impossible to prevent people from going out beyond those 19 counties uh near Sydney. And there's demand, this is now we're in the ride in the industrial revolution, and one of the the big industries of the industrial revolution was woollen cloth. OK, now, Sheep growing or wool growing in Australia is not initially um driven by high levels of demand in Britain, but increasingly demand is um it's going up. OK, there is a a a highly developed uh wool industry in Yorkshire, particularly, Bradford's the centre of it, and that's where this Australian wool is going. So what's happening here, Is the integration of Australian economy into an imperial division of labour, an imperial economy in which Australia provides the raw materials, and they're being processed, turned into manufactured goods in Britain. It's a classic colonial relationship. OK, and, uh, Australian wool growers benefit from the fact that Australia is a part of this uh wealthy, expansive empire. OK. So by 1845, Australia had overtaken the German states as Britain's main supplier of wool. OK, Australia is integrated into a British imperial economy. And I won't go into all that there, but you can see some of, again, the ancillary activities. We need to keep coming back to the fact that whenever there is a particular industry, it, it usually gives rise to other industries that are needed in order for the for the inputs or sometimes for the outputs, OK? If you have lots of wool, you need good ports, you need wharfies, you need insurance companies, you need banking, you need a whole bunch of things to support an industry of that sort. The, the price for this is paid by indigenous people, OK, and the killing really, um, uh, you know, really takes off in the 1820s and 1930s. It's not coincidental, it's some most famous massacres, you know, the Mile Creek massacre, the Waterloo Creek massacre, both in 1838. I got the order wrong there, of course, Waterloo Creek, beginning of the year, Mile Creek later. You know, this is a period when New England up in what is now northern New South Wales, was being developed for pastoralism. OK, that is the price being paid by indigenous people in the form of displacement and in the form sometimes of of of killing, of massacres. OK. And you know, the the the there's a kind of theory that's been developed around this of settler colonialism that basically says the central characteristic, and I'll finish on this note, the central characteristic of uh a um settler economy is what what what is called the logic of elimination, because you want the land more than you want the people who are already there. OK, so one can see that uh in these sorts of situations. Indigenous land is essential to the settler colonial economy. Um, pastoral expansion fans out from Sydney in various directions, including the limestone plains here. Um, it fans out from northern Tasmania across Bass Strait into Port Phillip. You can see what's happening here. This is now a land grab. What's begun as a colony clinging to a coastline is this is now a big land grab, a big land grab.
