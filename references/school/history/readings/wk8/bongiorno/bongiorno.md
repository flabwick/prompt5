optimism that matched perfectly the end of the drought and the shoots of economic recovery which, by the spring of 1983, already hinted at the better times ahead. And it contributed more than its fair share to the rising national pride of the early Hawke era, giving that moment a dreamlike quality in the more straitened times of the later 1980s and early 1990s. 
At the time of Australia II's victory, those entrusted with the nation's finances, Paul Keating and John Stone, were in the United States for a meet- ing of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. But the call of duty did not keep them away from Newport for the final race, where Keating and Stone - the latter decked out in 'navy blazer and commodore's cap' - found a relaxed Malcolm Fraser also enjoying the excitement.39 In possibly the most unlikely intimate moment in the history of Australian politics, Fraser took Keating in what the historian Manning Clark might have called a 40 But when Keating and manly embrace, after Australia II won the race. Stone returned to Australia soon afterwards, they faced a problem that Fra- ser had allowed to fester during the final years of his government: Australia's creaking financial system. The rapid development of international money markets and the growth of the non-bank financial sector in Australia ren- dered outmoded a regulatory system whose essential character had emerged in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. The Fraser govern- ment had appointed a committee headed by Sir Keith Campbell, a leading businessman, to inquire into the system. It reported in 1981 recommending comprehensive deregulation, but there was little political will to follow through.11 By the time the new government settled in to office in the autumn of 1983, with the Accord as the formal centrepiece of its economic policy and ending the recession its overwhelming goal, much of whatever momen- tum there was for reform of the financial system seemed to have fizzled. Labor formally favoured a tighter regulation of the financial system, not the loosening of control. But as would so often prove to be the case with this government, outward appearances were deceptive: Hawke, Keating and their key economic advisers were interested in what a less regulated finan- cial system could do for a sclerotic economy,

France, led to an unravelling of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates on which the stability of the international financial order had rested since the 1940s. In 1971 a US administration reeling from the combined costs of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty at home, and on Vietnamese com- munists abroad, had ceased to guarantee that its currency could be exchanged for gold. This decision of the Nixon administration effectively ended the Bretton Woods system. The rise of computer technology, the divergent eco- nomic performances of the major capitalist nations and the growing integration of international capital markets in the 1970s and early 1980s placed even greater pressure on national financial authorities. Speculators were increasingly able to move capital rapidly around the globe and, where opportunities arose, to profit from fluctuations in exchange rates - which effectively became one-way bets on currency movements. 
Countries responded to the challenges of the new environment in differ- ent ways. One response from some smaller countries was to peg the local currency to that of a major player. In the Australian case, the peg had become the US dollar in 1971, but from 1976 the rate was set by reference to what was called the trade weighted index, a figure derived from a basket of cur- rencies reflecting Australia's trading patterns. The daily exchange rate was then expressed in relation to the US dollar. The rate itself was set at a morn- ing meeting of three and later four wise men: senior officials from each of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Treasury, Finance and the Prime Min- ister's Department. In effect, only the RBA was permitted to deal in foreign exchange, since the trading banks had to settle their accounts at the end of each day. But the currency crisis that greeted the new government in March 1983 and resulted in devaluation appears to have played a decisive role in convincing many- although as we shall see, not all of the key play- ers that the old system was finished. 
42 
What had emerged was a cat-and-mouse game in which, to the extent that exchange controls permitted, speculators sought to profit at the expense of the Reserve Bank, and therefore ultimately the Australian taxpayer, by anticipating the exchange rate decisions of the authorities. After devaluation in March, the Reserve Bank was on a hiding to nothing but this time from speculation about an appreciation of the currency. The devaluation had been driven largely by political factors - the Coalition's election scaremon- gering about what a Labor government would do with people's savings - so there was little prospect of the Australian dollar falling further, and every likelihood of a rapid recovery. Treasury in any case had long favoured an

overvalued currency as a means of countering inflation, a preference widely known in the markets. Predictably, foreign exchange began flowing back into the country soon enough, and within a few months the dollar was reset at its pre-devaluation level. In the meantime, the government had been focused on the national economic summit, wages policy and the budget deficit. In order to set its spending priorities, it relied on an Expenditure Review Committee (ERC) comprising the prime minister and senior eco- nomic ministers. This became the engine-room of the Hawke Government, the place where all spending proposals except those in the forward estimates would be subjected to close scrutiny and, when found wanting, knocked firmly on the head.43 In practice, at least in the early years of the govern- ment, 'ERC decisions were de facto cabinet decisions, as one of its hardest heads, Peter Walsh, would explain in his memoirs.44 
The ERC epitomised the discipline of the new government, and its deter- mination not to be seen as reprising the spendthrift ways of the Whitlam era. It reinforced the new trend towards fiscal caution. In May Keating had deliv- ered an economic statement which foreshadowed a bond tender - effectively a government loan of $1.5 billion, reductions in the exceedingly generous treatment of superannuation benefits, and a budget deficit of $8.5 billion. In August he unveiled the budget itself.45 But financial matters had not, in the meantime, slipped off the agenda. Also in May, Keating had appointed a com- mittee - under businessman Vic Martin - to review the proposals advanced in 1981 by the Campbell inquiry.46 By commissioning its own report, the Labor government would be able to dress Campbell in Labor cloth:47 
Events, however, would overtake the Martin inquiry, at least insofar as the exchange rate was concerned. In the spring of 1983, a wave of cash flowed into the economy, prompting a decision for a partial float at the end of October. The Reserve Bank withdrew from any role in setting forward rates, and the trading banks took over. Meanwhile, the spot rate - that is, the rate determined each day by government officials - would still be set each morning, but the actual rate at which banks could convert their foreign exchange would be established at the end of the day, to allow traders greater freedom to buy and sell in response to movements on international markets. The RBA also no longer required the banks to convert the entirety of their foreign exchange accounts into Australian dollars each evening; it would set a limit for each bank.48 These changes, taken together, were expected to give the govern- traders experience of taking on risk; a common attitude among ment's economic advisers was that a full float would ensue before long,

possibly during a quiet period for the markets over the Australian summer.49 More immediately, there were hopes that these changes would discourage further speculation on movements in the Australian dollar. But currency traders considered the Australian dollar undervalued, especially in view of the overwhelming evidence of economic recovery. Hundreds of millions of dollars entered the country in early December, the inflow of money threat- ening the government's ability to regulate the amount of cash in the economy, thereby undermining the prospect of economic recovery. The burden of the flow of capital would be carried by interest rates, which could be expected to fall sharply in view of the amount of foreign exchange being converted locally into Australian cash, and by inflation, which would be stimulated by unplanned increases in the money supply. 
A new crisis unfolded on the last parliamentary sitting day of the year, 8 December, just as most inhabitants of the parliamentary village were let- ting their hair down. Hawke and Keating were not celebrating; they had heard from the RBA early in the evening that its New York office had reported a likely inflow of many millions of dollars the following day. Hawke and Keating spent the evening talking to one another, and to their economic advisers, about how they might avert this latest threat. At 10 pm, Keating told Stone over the phone that 'we are probably facing a float or something else' Stone understood that the RBA favoured a float 'to get the politicians out of their hair, but he was nonetheless fiercely opposed, predicting that the dollar would rise by at least 5 per cent. This would reduce the international compet- itiveness of the Australian economy and bring an end to recent euphoria about economic trends. In the current bull market 'we could afford to allow inflows to continue. According to the Treasury record of the conversation, Keating 'seemed convinced by all this but noted that the Prime Minister had "bought in", and he rang Stone back a little later to add that 'he was "afraid” that the matter was getting away from us? A cabinet Economic Policy Com- mittee (EPC) meeting was scheduled for the following day and with rumours running rife around Parliament House that something was up, closing the market on Friday seemed to Keating now to be the only feasible option. Stone argued against such a meeting of the EPC but agreed that if Hawke insisted it be held, the markets would indeed have to be closed, and they could only be reopened on the basis of a very different set of arrangements,50 
Around midnight Bob Johnston, the RBA governor, received another alarming report from New York, news which he relayed to Keating by phone in Canberra: $800 million was expected to flow into the country on Friday

9 December, a sum amounting to 1 per cent of the entire Australian money supply.51 Hawke and Keating now agreed to a full float. Keating consulted key ministers Bill Hayden, as a former treasurer; John Dawkins, the finance minister; and Ralph Willis, shadow treasurer in opposition, now in charge of industrial relations. All agreed. 52 He also phoned Johnston, telling him the float was on, and asking him and his senior officers to come to Can- berra on the first flight in the morning. Dealing in foreign currencies by Australian banks, except in small amounts for travellers, would be 'sus- pended for the time being 53 A series of morning discussions between politicians and officials culminated in a gathering of all the key players - Hawke, Keating, Stone, Johnston and various deputies, staffers and public servants. But in practice, the decision to suspend foreign currency dealing meant that there was no turning back. If the markets had reopened on Mon- day under the old rules, the government would have looked indecisive and foolish, its economic credentials shattered. The government had either to float or impose capital controls, and the latter solution would have issued a message about the Labor government's attitude to markets that it was quite unwilling to send. 
The positions occupied by the various participants at the meeting were predictable enough. Only Stone and Treasury opposed the float, no doubt encouraged by Johnston's laconic admission that 'he did not know what would happen' after it. Stone thought he did, warning that the currency appreciation was likely to result in the kind of 'major shock' that would be produced by a 20 per cent tariff cut. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25 per cent in 1973, with Hawke among its most vociferous critics; Stone was clearly playing to his audience, but he overreached when he went as far as to suggest 'an embargo on short-term capital flows. Hawke and Keating, committed to 'the desirability of allowing market forces to have more rein, dismissed the idea.54 So the decision taken was not only to float the dollar, but also - of at least equal import - to abolish most exchange controls. The horse had bolted; Stone and his officers retreated to Treasury to continue preparing the paperwork for the EPC. After it had applied its rubber stamp, Keating held a press conference to announce what had been done. He had Johnston, not Stone, at his side. On Monday, in an uneventful day of trading, the markets began dealing in Australian dollars for the first time. The sky remained in place.

The government attracted much praise for its courage, especially as journal- ists knew the decision to float had been accomplished in the face of Treasury opposition. The Australian headed its enthusiastic editorial on the float "The Nation Has Now Come of Age' but the Australian Financial Review, while no less supportive of the float in its editorial, appeared a little more appre- hensive in proclaiming on its front page the arrival of 'A Brave New World:55 A few years of hindsight did not cause journalists to alter first assessments of the decision's importance. In 1989 Greg Hywood declared that the float's effect had been to 'reshape the political and economic direction of the nation:56 For Paul Kelly, the float 'signalled the demise of the old Australia - regulated, protected, introspective, a judgment delivered in 1992,57 
It has become common to attribute Australia's economic success since the early 1990s to this decision above all others. Floating the dollar has resulted in the usual fate of success: it has acquired more than its due share of fathers.58 During the early years, the dominant narrative suggested that the float was the result of the flowering Hawke-Keating partnership, the growing author- ity in matters of economic policy of the Reserve Bank, and the eclipse of John Stone and Treasury as the main source of economic policy expertise. A biog- raphy published in 1988 by financial journalist Edna Carew with Keating's cooperation reported that 'Keating says he and Hawke took the view after the 10 per cent devaluation in March that the system of managing the exchange rate was finished? Carew's phraseology is telling: 'he and Hawke'59 And as late as 1990, by which time his relationship with Hawke had broken down, Keat- ing was still willing to discuss the float as a decision he and Hawke had made together.60 Stone's opposition was always central to this narrative, allowing Labor to place its own political brand on the float: it became a bold and far- sighted government, willing to make innovative and market-orientated policy in the national interest, unlike its political opponents and notwith- standing bureaucratic obstruction. Here was a potent political legend and one that served Labor's purposes well. The government's credibility among the financial markets and the business commentators in the media rose accordingly, even as many of its own supporters - especially once the dollar fell through the floor in 1986 - wondered what it had unleashed. 
In the years since, the waters have been muddied by the bitter public feud- ing of Hawke and Keating, with Stone a late entry into these controversies. When he published his memoirs in 1994, Hawke proudly claimed the mantle of the float's architect: 'In this, as with so much else throughout that first year in government, the engine room driving economic change in Australia was 
48 
THE EIGHTIES 
my personal office:61 The claim is far from implausible. Hawke had formal training in economics, had served on the Reserve Bank board in the 1970s, and was surrounded by economic advisers such as Ross Garnaut who shared his perspective on the need for financial deregulation, fiscal discipline and lower tariff barriers. While Keating, too, had able economic advisers in his own office and in the bureaucracy, he was less well placed. His seven years as Opposition spokesman on minerals and energy, in which he had developed a close working relationship with mining industry leaders, had disposed him to support a loosening of government controls. But having left school at fif- teen, unlike almost everyone who surrounded him in his new working life, he lacked formal economic training. Moreover, he had taken on the shadow Treasury role only at the beginning of the year. Early on, some of his public performances as shadow treasurer and treasurer were less than sparkling and, lacking confidence in his mastery of a complex portfolio, he leaned heavily on his department for advice. Yet Keating was also a gifted man with an unusual capacity to absorb, understand and communicate complex information, and he maintained a cordial relationship with the formidable, self-assured Stone. Until the very day of the float, the treasurer was hearing from Treasury and the RBA, from Stone and Johnston, two rather different stories about the best way forward. 
Keating, said Hawke, 'was learning to swim. He wished to take hold of the rope we were holding out, but... John Stone had grabbed his legs and was holding on for grim death... Paul would not kick free. In October, recalled Hawke, 'Stone's vociferous opposition and Paul's obvious reluctance were at odds with the desire of my office to float the dollar immediately? And even on the night before the float was announced in December, each time Keating 'mounted the stairs' in Parliament House to Hawke's office 'with the worry of Stone's opposition to a float etched on his brow... he had to be coaxed and talked along. Eventually, said Hawke, in the early hours of 9 December, he 'We've message: sent a staffer, Peter Barron, down to Keating's office with the just got to do it. In this way, while conceding the difficulty of Keating's posi- tion in view of Stone's opposition, Hawke asserted his ownership of the ultimate decision.62 
Keating has responded in kind with his own version of these events. Sev- eral published versions of the float from 1992 onwards - all indebted to Keating's testimony to some extent - place him, rather than Hawke, front row and centre of the decision. Keating has on several occasions nominated May 1983 as a critical month in the journey towards the float; apart from the

appointment of the Martin inquiry, he claims to have asked the RBA at this time to prepare a 'war book' on the steps to be taken in the event of a float. The preparation of a war book does not, however, signal an intention to go to war; it merely recognises its possibility. Keating has also indicated that it was in May that he persuaded Hawke that the dollar should be floated: 'As often was the case with him after I had sold him on something, he became an enthusiast for it.63 Keating called the discussion with Hawke and his advisers 'good therapy, if all too often tedious'; that is, it was his investment in getting the support of Hawke's office for a policy that he already knew was right. The decision to float, in this version, was Keating's.64 
How valid are Keating's claims? That he wanted to move in the direction of a less regulated foreign exchange market is beyond question. On 9 Sep- tember, in a conversation with Bob Johnston at which the governor told him the RBA was leaning towards a 'dirty float' - meaning greater flexibil- ity but with a significant level of central bank intervention - Keating did not demur, while explaining that he 'did not pretend to have a deep under- standing of the matter but felt that that was the way to go. As it turned out, Keating was unimpressed with the results of the partial float that emerged the following month as a compromise between the positions of the RBA and Treasury. On 23 November - about a fortnight before the full float - he wrote to Johnston with his concerns about the recent upward movement in the dollar. While the October changes seemed to have had a pleasing initial impact of reducing capital flows, these had since resumed. He continued: 
I consider the almost unbroken upward crawl... re-established in the market punters' minds the view that the only way our currency would go was up and, in this way, stimulated the resumption of unwanted flows. In short, I am concerned that the daily manage- ment of the rate effectively blew the opportunity provided by the changes to the system to break the vicious circle of capital inflows speculating on upward movements which were being forced on us by the inflows themselves.66 
This appears to be a significant letter which has not so far figured in the con- tinuing controversy about who floated the dollar. It looks remarkably like a declaration of independence, suggesting that Keating regarded the October reforms as a promising failure. While in his reply Johnston sought to allay 
48 
THE EIGHTIES 
the treasurer's concerns by playing down the role of speculative flows in dol- lar appreciation, it was clear that any further surge of capital, especially if it looked like it was coming from the 'punters' rather than long-term investors, was certain to prompt a renewed push for a float from Keating.67 Indeed, by the end of November, it was clear that Keating anticipated a float sooner rather than later when his adviser, Tony Cole, informed John Phillips of the RBA 'that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister had had a discussion about rate management and the Treasurer had been given the "green flag". It seems highly likely that the subject of this green flag was a float.68 
A third story - based on a mixture of recollection and personal papers -- has come from John Stone.69 Stone has positioned himself as a critic of Keating's version of events even more than of Hawke's, and he has contested the impression that Treasury was opposed to the float 'root and branch.70 On the face of it, his would appear to be an uphill battle. Yet by the spring of 1983 Treasury was indeed moving - albeit hesitantly and reluctantly towards an acceptance of the float's inevitability, being willing to support an 'evolutionary' approach to liberalising the foreign exchange market. But senior officials recognised that any decision to withdraw the RBA from set- ting forward rates and to relax exchange controls was likely to increase the pressure for a floating spot rate, so 'the Government would need to be rea- sonably sure that this is the way they eventually want to go?" Stone thought 'change... should be undertaken in stages. A complete and wholesale leap to a full market system overnight would be an act of faith to which the Gov- ernment has no need to commit itself at this time and the consequences of which cannot be clearly foreseen.72 
What is at stake in these disagreements? Hawke and Keating each wish to take the largest share of the personal credit for the float. But Keating could not have taken a decision as momentous as to float the dollar without Hawke's support, while Hawke could not have driven such a policy so suc- cessfully from his own office without the relationship that Keating had built up with Johnston and perhaps even that with Stone.73 In terms of the politics, a divided house would have been disastrous; the change needed to be sold to party and public, not least because the Martin review would be recommend- ing other changes that would require a reversal of Labor policy. The float needs to be seen in the context of the successful political relationship that was developing between Hawke and Keating by the end of 1983, and not through its later acrimony. Stone's preoccupations in the controversy are dif- ferent. He wishes to suggest that there was a gradual evolution taking place

towards a floating exchange rate, and that he and his subordinates provided their minister with advice about proceeding more slowly that would have been well heeded. While he and Treasury would pay the price for finding themselves on the losing side on 9 December, the basic thrust of his advice to Keating appears to have been sound. Keating's caution was also sensible in light of the advice he was receiving and the politics of the float. The conse- quences of a quick float could not have been foreseen, and none of the participants in the decision knew what would happen when the markets opened on Monday. 
The float revealed some of the best features of the Hawke Labor ment, as well as the traits that quickly came to worry its critics on the left. govern- There was a boldness about it, a determination as Hawke would say in another context - to '[f]uck the past, a refusal to be bound by established practice or tradition.74 Exchange rate management was an arcane matter, understood even in its basics by relatively few people. It was easy, therefore, to carry one's views with minimal consultation beyond the experts. Its impli- cations might have been far-reaching the value of the dollar would increasingly serve during the decade as a proxy for the state of the economy, if not of the nation - but it did not immediately affect the interests of any of Labor's core supporters. Indeed, it was difficult to identify any vested inter- est worried by the float, and there was little criticism of what had been done, even from the Opposition. 
- 
Yet the float was also the ultimate top-down kind of reform that became synonymous with the Hawke government, and it has been celebrated in large part as a triumph of strong and decisive leadership - something about which the Labor Party has always been ambivalent. Of course, there was a need for secrecy in decisions about the exchange rate because of the dan- gers of currency speculation; it was simply not the kind of matter that lent itself to wide consultation. Yet it is both striking and symbolically powerful that most of cabinet and all of caucus were excluded from considering an issue that would matter so much for the nation's future. There is a retrospec- tively humorous set of documents in the Treasury files regarding a request of 8 November from Alan Griffiths, the caucus secretary, asking that Keating contribute a paper outlining the issues relating to the exchange rate?75 The request kicked around Treasury for a few weeks, and a paper was prepared and being checked by officials in the week leading up to 9 December. But it was destined not to leave the building, being made redundant by the dra- matic events of that Friday. The story speaks eloquently of the irrelevance of 
50 
THE EIGHTIES 
caucus to what has come to be regarded as the most significant policy deci- sion of the era. 
The float, however, was just one of several government initiatives at this time that reshaped the financial order. Another was the simultaneous aboli- tion of most foreign capital controls.76 The Martin committee, moreover, gave the government the political cover it needed to present the Campbell report reforms as 'Labor' through and through." One of the most important of its recommendations was that to allow the entry of foreign banks, a mat- ter Hawke and Keating handled with considerable political dexterity. Keating's own family background and political lineage bestowed on him a rich store of opinions, emotions and rhetoric that could easily be turned to the uses he now required. His father's small engineering business had, by Keating's own account, suffered from its inability to raise the loans it needed to expand from Australian banks because they would only let his father bor- row against his assets. Keating was also a protégé of Jack Lang, Depression-era scourge of the 'money power. So when Keating 'sold' the foreign bank policy to the public and especially to the party, he emphasised the anti-establishment angle; allowing greater foreign competition would shake up Australia's banking industry, disturbing its cosseted dominance of the Australian finan- cial world. The policy would also stimulate the economy. As he told the Labor Party's national conference in July 1984, 'Banking is the artery of the economy and we have had hardening of the arteries for too long in this country. It is time we unclogged a few. Keating pointed out that interna- tional banks were already active in the Australian economy, operating as finance companies, helping to fund takeover bids, or operating out of a mer- chant bank or through an office in an Australian city. 'If it was not for the merchant banks here, for fifteen years gingering them up, we would still be back with quill pens and ledgers, up at the high tables making the folio entries.'78 The Labor Left faction opposed foreign bank entry but without effect; the Right and Centre Left waved it through. 
At the national conference, Keating had received strong backing from three Labor state premiers (the fourth, Wran, was chairing the conference). Much has been made of the divergence that supposedly emerged between the 'Keynesian' economic policy of the Victorian Labor government of John Cain and the 'economic rationalism' of Hawke and Keating. 'Ours was a Keynesian welfare state model, recalled Cain, just as he recalled how much it was loathed by his federal counterparts.79 The Victorian government was certainly more inclined to an expansionary economic policy than federal

Labor, and more confident of the capacity of public authorities to pick busi- ness 'winners. To pursue this goal, the Cain government upgraded a body created by the previous government - the Victorian Economic Develop- ment Corporation - so that it became the 'principal agency for the provision of targeted loan and equity funds to business.80 But Cain's government also saw opportunities in financial deregulation, hoping that foreign banks might elect to set up in Melbourne, and that they would compete successfully with the existing trading banks which, in Cain's opinion, had 'shown a great lack of initiative. He felt that manufacturing exporters had been especially starved for cash.81 
In 1984 the Bannon government merged the local state and savings banks to create the State Bank of South Australia, which combined tradi- tional retail functions such as home loans with markedly more ambitious lending and acquisition. The State Bank of South Australia was the cen- trepiece of its economic strategy; a cash cow for government, the driver of local business development and a source of local pride as it expanded beyond the state's borders. Adelaide might not have been able to attract the big global financial players but it had its own or so the story went.82 
Meanwhile in Perth, the Burke government hitched its wagon to Laurie Connell's Rothwells, which was a bank in name only, more a racket designed to finance Connell's expensive taste in Thoroughbreds and other forms of extravagance. The government's own Western Australian Development Cor- poration was wheeling and dealing with the best of them, in a state whose normal exuberance had received an additional boost from the America's Cup victory of its latest favourite son, Alan Bond, and from the much- anticipated cup defence in 1987.

Labor's enthusiasm for financial deregulation delighted, as it surprised, the markets, and it represented a major departure from its traditional suspi- cion of finance capital. Keating was rewarded in 1984 when the magazine Euromoney judged him Finance Minister of the Year which translated locally into his being 'the world's greatest treasurer?83 The party that under one of its most revered prime ministers, Ben Chifley, had tried to nation- alise the trading banks now took pride in the praise it received from local and international financiers. But at the party's grassroots, some very angry people found it difficult to square the direction of the ALP with what they thought it stood for. Some of their anger was aroused over issues of uranium mining policy, foreign policy and defence, a matter to be taken up in chap- ter 4. But the shift towards economic rationalism, as the free-market 
52 
THE EIGHTIES 
approach was increasingly called, was also a major grievance. A resolution of the party's North Sydney branch conveyed this growing disillusionment, expressing its: 
profound disappointment in the direction taken by the Biennial Conference. In particular, we are appalled by policy changes on the mining and export of uranium, East Timor, and foreign banks. The present policy of the A.L.P. in Government would have drawn howls of protest from the A.L.P. in opposition. The price of Madison Ave- nue politics is the long term loss of credibility on the part of the Party, and alienation of rank and file members.84 
There was disgruntlement in the unions too. Financial deregulation was one thing. But Hawke had hinted that tariff protection was also in his sights - and that, they could not abide. John Button, as industry minister, was signalling that protection needed to come down, that industries needed to think in terms of better planning, improved skills, new technologies and superior products. "There is a great unwillingness in this country to take risks, he commented in an interview, as he bemoaned the habit of both manufacturers and unions begging government for handouts. But when Labor came to office he faced a more urgent problem than weaning industry off the government breast: the crisis in the steel industry. There was an inter- national steel glut and BHP, the country's biggest company and almost its sole producer of steel, had already sacked thousands of workers. There was even talk of the company ceasing to produce steel entirely, a decision that would create economic and social chaos in Wollongong and Newcastle in New South Wales, and Whyalla in South Australia, the cities where steel plants were located. During the election campaign Hawke had promised a solution in his first hundred days in office. Now he - or rather Button - had to deliver. Hawke offered up his trusted economic adviser, Ross Garnaut, to work with the industry minister and his officials on what would become known as the steel plan. It was a five-year scheme, based on bounties aimed at encouraging investment and productivity improvements. That the plan did not guarantee BHP market share was telling; it reflected the govern- ment's developing challenge to protectionist solutions.8 
85 
Steel had long been regarded as providing 'the muscle of an industrial economy. If so, perhaps the car industry represented its bone and sinew. Con- centrated in Melbourne, Geelong and Adelaide, it was also heavily protected.

Behind a formidable tariff wall, quota restrictions and local content rules, five car producers turned out thirteen models, several of them with low produc- tion runs. Quality was variable; few cars were exported. The Button car plan, which was released in May 1984, envisaged reduced protection for the indus- try, and that manufacturers would be reduced to three and the number of models to six. When unions and firms later came to Canberra, and one man- ufacturer complained that if the number of cars flooding into the country continued 'like this we'll soon all be driving Daimler Benz, Paul Keating's eyes smiled: 'If that happens,' he said, 'we'll all be much better off?86 
Button had visited Europe early in 1984, where Sweden most impressed him as a source of ideas and inspiration for Australian manufacturing; on the left in the 1980s, there would be incessant talk of the attractions of the 'Swed- ish model, Sweden, Button informed Hawke in a letter in February 1984, had already restructured its industry, the Social Democrats having eliminated 'hand-outs' to flagging industries. Button continued: "The point should also be made, in the context of the endless debates in Australia, that the Swedes believe in the free market. They do not believe in bailing out weak industries, but their industry policy is based on deciding in broad terms what part of the market they want to be in... they then direct government resources' to that part of the market to encourage research and development, venture capital and exports. Australia, thought Button, was reaping the consequences of its long-term protectionism in support of manufacturing - protection had cul- tivated 'a sort of Banana Republic mentality' - as well as its 'penchant for selecting a panacea for all the woes of Australian industry, such as the mining boom and, more recently, our colleague's repeated promises of the sunrise industries solution. The 'colleague' here was Barry Jones, the science minis- ter; 'sunrise industries' were new, clean, high-technology and capital-intensive, and Jones saw them as the path to a reinvigorated Australian manufacturing sector. Button, however, had been confirmed in his scepticism by visiting Europe: 'there is no talk of sunrise industries in Europe as providing any sort of panacea. What they are talking about is, if I may modestly say so, what I have been talking about for the last year... the relevance of new technologies to existing industries in improving their capacity and performance?97 
A fight was brewing, and many observers thought that on the issue of pro- tection, the 1984 national conference in Canberra would turn out to be a bloodbath. In the Labor Left, and among union leaders, protectionist senti- ment remained strong. Unemployment was falling but only slowly - it was still, in mid-1984, almost 9 per cent and much higher in cities and regions of

manufacturing concentration. With many of their members out of a job, few union leaders thought the time opportune to be reducing protection although it is doubtful they would have seen any time as opportune - and one prominent left-wing official, the Amalgamated Metal Workers' Union's Laurie Carmichael, had instructed colleagues to go to Canberra to 'get rid of Button. While they were unlikely to be able to do that, union leaders met with the industry minister in a hotel suite ahead of the conference debate. They wanted the party platform altered to conform with the Accord's commitment to pro- tection; Button said he 'was not happy with the accord commitment to maintenance of high tariffs'; Ray Piriam of the Electrical Trades Union replied pointedly that 'he was not happy with [the] commitment to wage restraint in the accord' and Button ought to think about that. It was all pretty heavy going, the minister recalled. But they hammered out a compromise, and conference warfare was averted. In 'a short but acrimonious debate, speakers from the unions and the Left had made their point, but Button still felt it worth asking conference: 'why can Sweden make a car like the Volvo, and why can't we?'88 
89 
The Hawke government seemed to many commentators a new type of Labor government: men and a few women whose education had aroused a mixture of envy, suspicion, hostility and admiration as they had risen through the state Labor parties during the 1960s and 1970s. Union leaders had not disap- peared, but neither were they any longer the typical' Labor parliamentarian. The sociologist Sol Encel thought he was witnessing the effects of the 'mana- gerial revolution' on politics, the rise of the 'information specialist' and the 'professional manager?90 It was certainly harder than ever before to spot old- style trade unionists in the ministry, although they were there. Stewart West, a former wharfie, was immigration minister, while Mick Young, an ex-shearer from South Australia who had distinguished himself as a gifted campaign organiser, unfortunately turned out to be an accident-prone cabinet minister. More common than the working unionist was the tertiary-educated profes- sional who had come through the ranks of the union movement as a researcher, an official or both. Hawke had been a very early member of the species, while Ralph Willis, the industrial relations minister, was a later one. Both came to politics from the ACTU.

all Rhodes scholars, while Gareth Evans was also a graduate of the ancient university. Chris Hurford, like the fictional Jim Hacker in the British televi- sion comedy of the 1980s Yes Minister, was a graduate of the London School of Economics. Blewett, Beazley and Evans had all worked in universities, as had Barry Jones, though he was better known to Australians as a TV quiz champion. Lawyers - especially industrial lawyers were prominent, in both federal and state governments. Even those federal government mem- bers with farming backgrounds, such as John Kerin, the primary industries minister, and Peter Walsh, initially in resources and energy but from 1984 in charge of finance, had attended university as mature-age students. Other ministers, too, had studied as adults, in some instances after they had been elected to parliament; Hayden was one of these and Barry Cohen, who held portfolios in the arts, environment and heritage in the early years of the gov- ernment, was another. Keating was a notable exception to the trend towards academic credentials, but his taste for classical music and expensive antiques was, to say the least, unusual among the working-class communities of west- ern Sydney among which he had been raised. The only woman in cabinet, Susan Ryan, was a former teacher active in the women's movement. Raised as a Catholic and with her eye on an education portfolio which Hawke ini- tially seemed reluctant to give her - he was apparently worried about how Catholics would react to her feminism - Ryan 'enlisted the good opinion of Archbishop James Carroll, a politically astute prelate who chaired the NSW Catholic Education Commission. Ryan had been raised a Catholic, but was as Mick Young put it - a non-financial member. She was also the first ever female federal Labor minister,91

The government was divided according to factions - Left, Right and, from early 1984, a Centre Left which included Hayden and many of his 
sup- porters along with an assortment of others who, for one reason or another, did not slot readily into the two larger factions. Factional leaders played a significant role in managing conflict and ensuring an acceptable division of the spoils of office, contributing powerfully to the government's stability. Yet there was also an emerging esprit de corps among ministers that tran- scended such factional divisions. It was captured well in a letter written by John Dawkins, the finance minister and a member of the Centre Left, to the prime minister in 1984 when the Hawkes were dealing with their daughter's drug addiction: 'My respect for you and your gift for leadership have grown continuously since we set out on this great venture - the cause and course of which remain absolutely correct?92 The Left was initially rather remote from 
58 
THE EIGHTIES 
- 
the centre of power, as well as from the emerging orthodoxies in economic, defence and foreign policy, but these differences would decline after 1984. 
The Hawke government's enthusiasm for 'reform' was rather less effusive outside the favoured field of finance. There was little interest in constitu- tional reform; a proposal for a bill of rights, championed by the young attorney-general, Gareth Evans, floundered, and eventually died. Yet the show held together in large part because the government combined an eco- nomic policy increasingly geared towards the financial markets with a social policy that was recognisably Whitlamite at least if you were prepared to squint a little while contemplating it. Above all, there was Medicare. After an arduous battle under the generalship of Bill Hayden, the Whitlam govern- ment had finally succeeded in establishing Medibank in 1975, just in time for the Fraser government to begin dismantling it. The Accord committed Labor to a replacement scheme of universal health insurance when it came to office in 1983. ACTU support was critical in Medicare's success, but so was the weakness of the opposition to Medicare from doctors, private health funds and even the federal Coalition. It also helped that the responsible minister, Blewett, was highly competent, and that Medicare would reduce inflation by flattening out medical costs.93 
Another area in which the government quickly chalked up a major achievement was the passage of the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984, which aimed to remove the disabilities under which women laboured in connection with employment, education, housing and provision of services such as access to credit. It, too, experienced only a muted opposition in the parliament but there was a hard core of conservative MPs in each house - a few of them bla- tantly misogynistic - who saw the proposal as 'great load of nonsense?94 Senator Brian Archer, a Tasmanian Liberal, declared that no amount of legis- lation' would 'change the fact that most ordinary, natural women are homely and caring, that they are not wildly ambitious, that they are not naturally dominating... Men, by nature, are most likely to be leaders, providers and protectors.""" Politicians such as these had the support of a noisy minority of moral conservatives outside who lobbied hard against the bill, professing to see in it a threat to the family, an effort to lock women out of the home and into the workforce, even a measure to facilitate abortion. A group known as Women Who Want to Be Women was prominent in stoking fears about the end of civilisation, claiming that the government was seeking to create a uni- sex society. They asked for divine help in dealing with the minister responsible for the bill, Susan Ryan: 'Please pray that God will restrain Senator

When the BRW Rich List announced Australia's first two billionaires in 1987, it unsurprisingly included the cashed-up Packer, along with Robert Holmes à Court: the 'patrician and the punter, as Les Carlyon dubbed them. '[I]t was the age of the entrepreneur, just as surely as 1847 was the 
age of the squatter, he declared.27 'Only the 1851 gold rush could rival 1987; added BRW business editor Robert Gottliebsen, grasping for another historical comparison.28 But there were really no comparisons that quite worked. Mergers and acquisitions alone accounted for over $11 billion in 1987; Aus- tralia had never seen anything like it.29 Yet while recognising that 'eventually the stockmarket will take a tumble, Gottliebsen was optimistic: not only had unprecedented wealth been created, the foundations of even greater wealth were being laid.30 That the entrepreneurs' castles had been built of sand seemed to elude even the most experienced business journalists.31 As on the occasion of every previous boom, there was something deeply alluring in the idea that this one was different from all the others.32 A recognition that 'many of the new men were essentially traders, buying other people's assets rather than creating new ones' was leavened by the 'aggregations of sub- stance' that they had supposedly assembled.33 
The boom, however, was in its essentials a familiar enough beast, being fuelled by sharply rising prices - especially of shares, which quadrupled in value between 1983 and 1987 - combined with the banks' willingness to risk large sums of money. The tax deductibility of interest payments encouraged a preference for taking out loans over issuing shares. Higher share prices and increased company valuations stimulated by takeover activity could then be used as security against the next loan, much as rising land values had fuelled Melbourne's famous boom of a century before.34 But interest rates remained high and climbed further in response to the plunging dollar in 1986, while profits were often too low to absorb the obligations incurred through mas- sive borrowing and capital issues. Asset sales were one way of dealing with the problem of a lack of cash, a solution that sometimes motivated more borrowing for the sake of acquiring more cash and assets buried in takeover targets. These could be deployed to deal with problems elsewhere in one's sprawling empire. Within groups such as Bond and Qintex, assets and money were shuffled among companies in ways that obscured the financial situation of any particular part. Meanwhile, armies of lawyers and accoun- (ants advised on how these businessmen could organise their affairs so as to pay tax of five and ten cents in the dollar - as Ron Brierley's Industrial Equity Limited (IEL) and John Elliott's Elders IXL did respectively in 1986 - rather 
130 
THE EIGHTIES 
than the official company rate of 49 per cent.35 The ease with which money could be taken out of the country encouraged the use of tax havens such as Liechtenstein, a Bond favourite, or the Bahamas, Packer's refuge of choice. 
Above all, there was naïve optimism that values would keep climbing, even if subject to the occasional market correction? Financial deregulation was a contributor to this dangerous cycle because corporate regulation largely failed during the 1980s. New government agencies such as the National Companies and Securities Commission and the National Crime Authority were ill-equipped to deal with the scale and complexity of the transactions that became standard fare. Entrepreneurs maintained teams of professionals who were skilled in finding legal loopholes, creative account- ing and opinion-shopping among auditors, who mysteriously failed to report adversely on companies teetering on the brink of collapse. The knack of burying inconvenient detail in company annual reports advanced in leaps and bounds. The most successful Australian novelists of the period, such as Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey, had talented rivals in the corporate world in the art of imaginative fiction. 
Deregulation had increased the international mobility of capital and the competition among banks for local business, providing borrowers with con- siderable market power. That was one of its aims. The result, however, was not lower interest rates and easier credit for enterprising small and medium- sized businesses, but a scramble among the banks for market share. The interest rate for housing loans, for instance, was 15.5 per cent in 1986-87, Such rates were in part the result of inflation which, although lower than in the 1970s, never dropped below 7 per cent after 1984 and in 1986-87 climbed above 9 per cent - at a time when US inflation rates bobbed around between 2 and 5 per cent.36 Inflationary expectations encouraged businesses to borrow heavily, since the value of both the principal and interest payments would decline with rising prices. Profit margins on such lending were slim, which encouraged high levels of risk-taking among financiers sometimes inclined to equate caution with a deficiency of masculinity.37 All of the chatter concerning a new and softer masculinity engendered by feminism seemed rather irrele- vant when one contemplated the world of big business, since each corporate boss had a team of executives - almost exclusively male - who resembled noth- ing so much as a football team preparing for a big game. The media responded by reporting business affairs as if they were indeed sporting contests.3

have been hard to conjure two men less alike. The chain-smoking, football- loving Elliott's public persona was that of the rugged Aussie bloke without polish or pretension, one with the tastes and manner of an ordinary working man."9 'In an era when males are tending to become effeminate, he is the opposite end of the graph, wrote journalist Keith Dunstan in 1985.40 A com- edy program that used rubber dolls to satirise Australian public life presented a beer-swilling, fag-smoking Elliott, whose nose resembled more an ele- phant's trunk than the admittedly ample version on his face. The Elliott doll's verbal signature was to exclaim 'pig's arse!' often backed by a thunderous belch. But in important ways Elliott epitomised a new breed of Australian businessman. A scion of the Melbourne middle class rather than the estab- lishment - to put him through a private school, his parents ran a milk bar on top of his father's day job as a public relations man - Elliott was among the first to complete a Master of Business Administration (MBA) at Melbourne University. From there, he went to work for the consulting firm McKinsey, including eighteen months in its Chicago office, returning to Australia determined to apply American management know-how to the local scene.11 
Elliott was a planner, a businessman who believed that a gut instinct and dogged determination were of no use without a clear strategy and a tal- ented team of executives. Having set his sights in the early 1970s on an old and underperforming Tasmanian jam company, Henry Jones IXL, Elliott gained the critical backing of powerful members of the Melbourne business establishment for a takeover bid. Sir Ian McLennan, the chairman of BHP, was a supporter, as was Sidney Baillieu Myer, of the namesake retailing firm, and Roderick Carnegie, Elliott's boss at McKinsey and later managing director and chairman of the giant mining company Conzinc Riotinto of Australia. Elliott assembled a team of smart young men who, from their modest offices in South Yarra near the old IXL Jam Factory - redeveloped as a collection of posh shops and boutiques - went on to take over the old SA pastoral company Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort in 1981. McLennan, at seventy-two, emerged from retirement to become chairman of the com- pany being run by his forty-year-old protégé, identifying the company more closely than ever with the Melbourne business establishment. The spectacular acquisition of Carlton and United Breweries (CUB) for almost $1 billion followed two years later. 42 
Elliott's move on CUB, coming at it did in the very week the Australian dollar was floated, might be construed as cutting the ribbon on the age of the 1980s entrepreneur. The chain of events was triggered by another takeover

specialist, Ron Brierley, who had built up a stake in CUB, to which its board and chairman, 71-year-old Sir Edward Cohen, responded with something less than a vigorous defence. Elders IXL was already effectively a subsidiary of CUB, which owned just under half the company, so Elliott was deeply interested in any attempt by an outsider to accumulate a large parcel of CUB stock. Cohen dithered over legal technicalities; Elliott and his advisers, by way of contrast, had a contingency plan for just this kind of eventuality. Having decided that only a full takeover of CUB would work financially for Elders IXL, the nimble Elliott raised the $700 million cash he needed from three foreign banks in just a couple of days, thereby incidentally contribut- ing to the federal government's decision to float the dollar. BRW declared the rapid-fire Elders takeover of CUB a 'victory for the smart, fast-moving, MBA-style business breed over the entrenched traditionalist?43 CUB's board would not be the last to find itself unable to withstand the pressures of the new kind of corporate life that emerged in the 1980s.44 
By early 1984 Elliott led one of Australia's largest and most successful companies. He was powerful and well-paid but not personally wealthy by the standards of the era's really big men, since he owned only a modest stake in the company he led.45 He was also unusual among the major entrepre- neurs of the period in wearing his political allegiances on his sleeve, eventually becoming federal president of the Liberal Party in 1987 after an earlier stint as treasurer.46 His supporters in the Liberal Party talked of him as 'the rich man's Bob Hawke'47 - to which an obvious retort might have been that Bob Hawke was the rich man's Bob Hawke - and he had publicly expressed political ambitions as early as 1973.48 As the Liberals floundered under the leadership of Andrew Peacock following the 1983 election, and again under Howard after the 1987 defeat, Elliott emerged as one possible answer to their problems.49 The talk about a transfer to politics continued through the 1980s, a further destabilising factor for the party, as if it did not already have enough to contend with. Yet Elliott often gave the impression that he regarded the current crop of politicians - on both sides - as a collec- tion of mediocrities, and that all the country really needed was to hand over the reins to a successful businessman - that is, to someone just like him. He repeatedly revealed an absence of political finesse, publicly criticised the policies and leadership of his own party, and made a habit of impugning the very vocation that he claimed to be interested in practising. His policy ideas were also frequently impractical, while his understanding of history, to which he made frequent allusion, was embarrassingly shallow. Churchill

and Thatcher were his heroes: John Dorman Elliott would, like them, save his ailing country from the squabbling, weak-kneed bunglers.50 
Holmes à Court cut a very different kind of figure: aristocratic in bearing, prone to long and seemingly thoughtful silences, carefully chewing over his words, dry in wit, polished in manners, refined in taste. Distantly related to Lord Heytesbury, a nineteenth-century British politician and diplomat, Holmes à Court called his private company Heytesbury Securities and used the family insignia as his own. He had garages full of classic cars and studs of valuable Thoroughbreds, but did not bet. And when his horse, Black Knight, won the 1984 Melbourne Cup, Holmes à Court was a long way from Fleming- ton, tucked up in his bed asleep in London where he was doing business. 
51 
While he was not given to advertising his political allegiances, his wife Janet was left-wing and his own loathing of racism as a young man appears to have been one of the reasons he decided to live in Australia rather than Rhodesia or South Africa. The financial journalist David Uren noted that Holmes à Court 'never indulged in the union-bashing oratory or monetarist pontificating common among his peers in the business world?52 When unions worried about a possible threat to the Button steel plan expressed opposition to his bid for BHP, he had little difficulty reassuring them that they had no cause for alarm, and he similarly managed to charm powerful members of the Hawke government.53 All the same, Gareth Evans, federal minister for resources and energy, confessed in his diary in March 1986 after a dinner at his place for the Holmes à Courts that he was becoming irritated with the entrepreneur's 'absolutely unashamed arrogance - if that's the right word: maybe it's better to say "supreme self-confidence". Yet Evans remained impressed with 'the sheer class of the man... which is manifestly in a cate- gory above and beyond any of his competitors, and light years beyond that which BHP itself can muster'54 
Holmes à Court launched his first bid for BHP in 1983 using a tractor distribution company called Wigmores. Few took the bid seriously and Holmes à Court was able to acquire only a small number of shares. A sec- ond attempt in 1984 was a more serious proposition: this time he built up a 4.5 per cent stake. His masterstroke, however, was to enter into an options agreement with another aggressive share raider, John Spalvins of Adsteam, which in essence allowed Holmes à Court to continue secretly building his stake through Spalvins while BHP thought he was actually offloading its shares. In October 1985 it came to light that Holmes à Court owned an alarming 11 per cent of the company,55 
134 
THE EIGHTIES 
With a share-market value by 1986 of around $10 billion, and more than 60,000 employees and 180,000 shareholders - many of them in for the long haul - BHP would be a glittering prize for any entrepreneur with the wit, resources and luck to gain control of it. When the social researcher Hugh Mackay investigated Australia's attitudes to big business in 1985, he found that BHP had a special status in that many people appear to feel themselves qualified to comment' on its performance and management. He attributed this specialness to BHP's dominant position and corporate advertising in which it had deliberately placed itself in a close relationship with the com- munity, with the result that the community felt that it had a right to criticise as well as to praise.56 BHP mattered to government for these kinds of rea- sons, for its role as a major producer of what had become the country's most lucrative export commodity, coal, as well as for the $3.4 billion in tax, royal- ties and levies it delivered every year.57 
The Hawke government did flirt with the idea of a national-interest test in connection with Holmes à Court's ambitions. BHP, for its part, wanted the government to use a Trade Practices Act provision prohibiting the trans- fer of monopolies to block him. In early March 1986, Hawke government ministers heard each side in the struggle make its pitch, BHP executives first, led by their managing director Brian Loton, and then the lone figure of Holmes à Court addressing them the following day. When Keating told Loton that they would also be seeing Holmes à Court, the BHP man replied: 'I know, Paul, I've got to tell you he's fantastic; you know he's his own finan- cial adviser, his own lawyer, his own analyst and his own operator. He's phenomenal. Holmes à Court did not disappoint, easily outshining the BHP team. Cabinet, after reassurance from Keating, rejected the idea of interfer- ing in the matter. When Stewart West, the only minister to put up any resistance, predicted ‘a great unity ticket in Caucus against the Cabinet's proposal, Keating replied: 'It won't be the first time that Caucus has leapt to the defence of the Melbourne Club,'58 
Keating and almost everyone in cabinet had again signalled sympathy with the risk-takers against the establishment. The free market and the national interest were now one, so far as big takeover bids were concerned - and this idea would increasingly overtake the government's attitude to the economy as a whole. While attracting much less attention than the decision to float the dollar, the government's hands-off approach to the struggle for BHP was hardly less significant. The reasoning was simple, and based on the very same assumption as the decision to float: the market knew best. If the

financiers were prepared to bankroll a bidder, and a company's shareholders were willing to sell at the price being offered, that provided the most rigorous national-interest test available. As a critic of the government, Brian Toohey, put it in 1987: 'The market is always right. It commands respect, because, behind its apparent volatility, it makes impersonal, objective judgments... What would have been dismissed a few years ago by Labor advisers as an ide- ology of unswerving self-interest is now accepted as "market sentiment" faithfully reflecting some undefined, but greatly revered "fundamentals". Here was indeed a new way of thinking, especially for Labor; to question the mar- ket was now to risk being 'branded a fossil from the Whitlam era'59 But this economic rationalism also hitched the government to a wagon that would provide a wild ride in the years ahead. 
Markets, as Toohey suggested, were not impersonal things. They were made of people, and the Melbourne establishment showed that it was still capable of closing ranks against a raider from the west. When Holmes à Court looked likely to take control of BHP unless a third player intervened decisively - and it was clear it would not be the federal government - Elliott was able to repay some old debts to the Melbourne establishment that had long backed him, while using the threat to strengthen the company he led. In January 1986 Holmes à Court announced a bid of $1.295 billion that would have given him 39 per cent of BHP: given the spread of small share- holders, quite sufficient to control it. Talks between Elliott and BHP about defensive action began; Elliott saw BHP as a potential backer of the interna- tional expansion of his brewing interests, and he did not want the company to fall into the hands of an interloper. But there was no agreement between the two companies about how to deal with the threat from Holmes à Court, and BHP looked like it might suffer the same fate at his hands as CUB had suffered at Elliott's.60 
Elliott decided to take action without BHP knowledge or cooperation, in the hope of getting the Big Australian to the negotiating table. Elders would acquire just under 20 per cent of BHP. Ideally, that would force the company into a billion-dollar investment in Elders IXL, in a defensive cross- shareholding arrangement. On 10 April 1986, having lined up a couple of billion dollars from bankers, stockbrokers operating for Elders were offering to buy BHP shares for seventy-two cents more than the closing price of the previous day. There was much excited speculation that Elliott was behind the $10 million per minute splurge on the Melbourne Stock Exchange, and just before two o'clock he called BHP's Brian Loton to confirm the rumours. 
136 
THE EIGHTIES 
After more buying on overseas exchanges overnight and in Melbourne the following day, Elders had a stake of almost 19 per cent of BHP, close to the maximum permitted without announcing a formal takeover bid.61 
It had been a frenzied day of trading, the boom's emblematic moment. BHP responded quickly by taking out a $1 billion shareholding in Elders IXL, a prudent measure since anyone who now gained control of Elders would, as a result, also win a large stake in BHP. But Elliott did not enjoy negotiating with his rival Holmes à Court. They met over two-and-a-half hours on the Saturday morning following the Elders raid, each refusing to sell his stake to the other. Holmes à Court offered to take over Elders on terms he thought might be attractive to Elliott: 'We'd get control and you'd get to be Prime Minister. There were, as was common in negotiations with Holmes à Court, long periods of silence. Elliott recalled: 'We spent a lot of time just looking out of the window, which pissed me off because I was anx- ious to get away to the footy'62 By the end of May Holmes à Court would own about 28 per cent of BHP's shares - not enough to control the company, but too many for him to be ignored indefinitely." Both Elliott and Holmes à Court would be appointed to the BHP board in a peace deal agreed later in 1986, although no one imagined that either of these ferociously competitive men could remain content with this arrangement for very long. 
Elliott was at the centre of the other great battle of the era: that between CUB and Bond for beer sales at home and abroad. With its ambition to 'Fosterise the World', CUB would do for beer what McDonald's had done for ham- burgers and Colonel Sanders for fried chicken - but not if Bond had anything to do with it. Bond, like Elliott, was determined to increase his sales in the British and US markets with his Swan Premium Lager and Castlemaine XXXX. The companies controlled by Elliott and Bond both launched aggressive overseas advertising campaigns, with Paul Hogan featuring in Foster's commercials and Bond's using images of matey outback types; nobody's stereotype of Australia was too radically challenged. But closer to home, the battle was even more intense. Beer-drinking was one of several popular Australian activities in which regional and state loyalties were resil- ient. In this field, as in so many others, entrepreneurs believed they could remake the culture; by creating a national market for their wares, they would complete the nation-building that federation-era politicians had begun in the 1890s.

in 'the largest takeover in Australian corporate history, Bond controlled almost half the Australian beer market, with his strength being in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales.64 CUB, which controlled much of the remainder, had its heartland in Victoria, but it had taken over Tooths and so, like Bond, had a foothold in the Sydney market. Sydney became the key battleground; the intensity of this struggle gained something from beer's declining sales in the face of the challenge offered by wine.65 
Advertising executives, like producers of armaments in wartime, rubbed their hands with glee at the lucrative accounts gained from these battles. Swan was marketed through a series of advertisements designed by the firm Mojo, famous for its ocker ads and catchy jingles. The Swan commercials featured various well-known Australians accompanied by a song containing the refrain, 'They said you'd never make it. Drinking Swan was for those who did things the hard way but finally 'came through' - just in time to cel- ebrate their success with a long, cold beer. But the results of all this activity must have been disappointing to the Perth entrepreneur, for drinkers remained notably loyal to their favourite brands. Queensland drinkers and publicans proved especially resistant to an interloper from the west - and Bond's beers even lost market share." CUB, meanwhile, put the Foster's label on the country's great sporting events, including the Victorian Football League (VFL) grand final, the Adelaide Formula One Grand Prix and the Melbourne Cup. Elliott cut a dashing figure chatting with Princess Diana in the official party in 1985. He had apparently made it - and without the assis- tance of Swan Lager. 
These businessmen could not have plied their trade without willing bankers, and of the major trading banks, Westpac - formed by a merger of the Bank of New South Wales and the Commercial Bank of Australia in 1982 - was the most 'willing, handing over vast sums to some of the nation's most reck- less buccaneers. 67 Banks now sometimes found themselves lending hundreds of millions to an entrepreneur aiming to take over the business of one of their longstanding customers: Westpac lent money to Holmes à Court in his quest to acquire BHP, which had itself previously used Westpac as its banker.68 The practice of stitching together loan finance from a variety of sources, at home and abroad, also made the calculation of risk on the part of the lender more difficult than ever. Westpac, for instance, handed over large sums to George Herscu for his madcap American adventures. Herscu's 1985 
138 
THE EIGHTIES 
takeover of Hooker Corporation, Australia's second-largest property com- pany, was the prelude to an ambitious course of speculative investment in Australia and especially the United States that eventually destroyed the com- pany and sent Herscu bankrupt. When the company collapsed, its debts to about seventy-five banks amounted to $2 billion; Westpac alone was down $200 million. But Herscu's disastrous shopping mall projects in the United States reflected the extravagance of his personal taste. The lavish opening of the massive Forest Fair mall outside Cincinnati in March 1989 was attended by 70,000 people, with Herscu's favourite singer, Marie Osmond, providing the entertainment. A band played 'Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport. George Herscu, too, was in his own way taking Australia to the world.69 
ANZ, which had lost its exclusive status as the Fairfax banker in 1983, may well have provided the 26-year-old business novice Warwick Fairfax with a vast loan as a way of restoring its standing with the great company. It is otherwise difficult to explain the bank's apparent madness in funding the young man's takeover of the family business. Warwick, fresh from Oxford, Harvard Business School, the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Los Angeles Times, was determined to take control of a company he believed to be his rightful inheritance. Sir Warwick, his father, had died earlier in 1987 and Young Warwick's shy older half-brother James had for a decade been a fine chairman of the board. 
Young Warwick's interests, according to his mother, Lady Mary, were Jesus and journalism; he had a close relationship with a number of other ear- nest young Christians whom he had met at Oxford.70 His head full of the latest business management theories, Warwick had quietly devised a scheme to seize control of the company in collaboration with his mother and a coterie of public relations men, advisers to the family and plausible deal-makers - the most plausible of them all being the WA banker Laurie Connell, who was promised an astronomical fee of $100 million in return for his dubious ser- vices. Even as originally devised, the deal was risky, since it assumed that members of the Fairfax family with shares in the company would hold on to them and willingly accept Warwick's control. Instead, they sold their shares at the high price being offered through the bid, which meant Warwick needed additional finance to buy them out. Meanwhile, even before the takeover was accomplished, the stock market collapsed in October 1987, slashing share prices across the board, but Warwick persisted in the bid, therefore paying pre-collapse prices, ANZ eventually lent him $2 billion. Those who sold their Fairfax shares made a killing in a depressed market, and Warwick had to start

Australia's oldest and greatest media company spent the early 1990s in receivership, a century and a half of Fairfax family control coming to an end. While the poor judgment of Warwick and his mother was primarily respon- sible, without the acquisitive takeover culture of the 1980s, and without a lender such as ANZ being willing to hand over such a vast sum, Warwick may well have been content to join his friends on a Christian commune and live off the dividends from his shareholding. At the very least, he might have spent a decade learning a little about the family business; the chairmanship of the company was likely to have eventually fallen to him given the struc- ture of the family's share ownership. A joke that did the rounds asked: how do you create a small business in Australia? Answer: you give a large busi- ness to Warwick Fairfax, 
Fairfax was perhaps the most prominent example of an 'establishment' business destroyed in the new economic climate of the 1980s, although it was not unique in this respect. Adsteam - the venerable Adelaide Steamship Company, established in 1875 - which was run by a Latvian migrant named John Spalvins, experienced a period of massive expansion in the 1980s before falling apart in the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash. Spalvins, who had married into the Adelaide establishment, borrowed heavily in building up a company that included such businesses as Woolworths and David Jones as well as large shareholdings in the trading banks. The various entities in the Adsteam group were buying shares from one another, pushing up the share price, paying each other dividends recorded as profits, and then borrowing heavily on the increased paper value of the stock. Spalvins's gam- bling on the options market against Holmes à Court also led to huge losses, contributing to the eventual collapse of his group."2 
- 
While the big banks were more than pleased to compete for the busi- ness of corporate adventurers of this kind so long as the boom lasted, at the riskier edges of the financial market there were the cowboys such as Con- nell called 'Last Resort Laurie' on account of his reputation for lending money to unfortunates refused by everyone else - and the Melbourne mer- chant bank Tricontinental's brash young chief, Ian Johns. Owned but not controlled by the State Bank of Victoria, Trico deliberately courted riskier lenders on a course of rapid growth. Its stated assets grew by 101 per cent 
140 
THE EIGHTIES 
in the year to 1986 and a further 32 per cent to 1987, by which time they stood at $2.6 billion, making it officially the country's largest merchant bank. Trico's apparent success won for Ian Johns the Young Businessman of the Year Award in 1986. One of the award's judges was Christopher Skase, a favourite client.73 
The blinking computer screens in bank offices across the country hinted at a mathematical sophistication in assessing risk; the reality was very different. Banks lent millions of dollars to a non-government organisation in Victoria, the National Safety Council (NSCV), on the security of empty crates that its chief had managed to persuade bankers were full of expensive equipment. The NSCV, founded in 1927 to promote road and industrial safety, was led by a shadowy figure who called himself John Friedrich. He later turned out to be an illegal immigrant named Friedrich Johann Hohenberger, who had arrived by plane in January 1975 after faking his death when caught embez- zling from his employer in his native West Germany. After spending time working in Aboriginal communities, Friedrich applied successfully for a position with the NSCV. He quickly rose through the organisation to become its chief in 1982. His salary eventually climbed to $130,000, although he lived a modest lifestyle with his Australian wife and children on a property near the NSCV's base at Sale in Gippsland.74 
Friedrich, described later as 'an affable, motivated workaholic, was able to transform his sleepy outfit into a sophisticated search-and-rescue organ- isation by fraudulently borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars and eliciting the assistance of a few friendly businesses that helped him cook the books, 75 
His frauds were intended to build up the NSCV and so feed his narcissism; they were not for his personal financial benefit." Partly organ- ised on paramilitary lines, the NSCV at the time of its collapse in 1989 had assets including a fleet of 22 helicopters, 10 fixed-wing planes, a 42-metre flagship, a midget submarine, search and rescue boats, a vast array of vehi- cles, decompression chambers, computer equipment, an infra-red scanner and much else that was shiny, flashy and expensive. Pigeons were being pre- pared for search-and-rescue missions, dogs to be parachuted with their handlers into remote areas to look for missing people. Friedrich enjoyed surrounding himself with fit young men - some of whom he rewarded with expensive cars - and he was especially proud of the elite para-rescue group, or PJs (parachute jumpers), as they were known.
