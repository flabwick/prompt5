in 'the largest takeover in Australian corporate history, Bond controlled almost half the Australian beer market, with his strength being in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales.64 CUB, which controlled much of the remainder, had its heartland in Victoria, but it had taken over Tooths and so, like Bond, had a foothold in the Sydney market. Sydney became the key battleground; the intensity of this struggle gained something from beer's declining sales in the face of the challenge offered by wine.65 
Advertising executives, like producers of armaments in wartime, rubbed their hands with glee at the lucrative accounts gained from these battles. Swan was marketed through a series of advertisements designed by the firm Mojo, famous for its ocker ads and catchy jingles. The Swan commercials featured various well-known Australians accompanied by a song containing the refrain, 'They said you'd never make it. Drinking Swan was for those who did things the hard way but finally 'came through' - just in time to cel- ebrate their success with a long, cold beer. But the results of all this activity must have been disappointing to the Perth entrepreneur, for drinkers remained notably loyal to their favourite brands. Queensland drinkers and publicans proved especially resistant to an interloper from the west - and Bond's beers even lost market share." CUB, meanwhile, put the Foster's label on the country's great sporting events, including the Victorian Football League (VFL) grand final, the Adelaide Formula One Grand Prix and the Melbourne Cup. Elliott cut a dashing figure chatting with Princess Diana in the official party in 1985. He had apparently made it - and without the assis- tance of Swan Lager. 
These businessmen could not have plied their trade without willing bankers, and of the major trading banks, Westpac - formed by a merger of the Bank of New South Wales and the Commercial Bank of Australia in 1982 - was the most 'willing, handing over vast sums to some of the nation's most reck- less buccaneers. 67 Banks now sometimes found themselves lending hundreds of millions to an entrepreneur aiming to take over the business of one of their longstanding customers: Westpac lent money to Holmes à Court in his quest to acquire BHP, which had itself previously used Westpac as its banker.68 The practice of stitching together loan finance from a variety of sources, at home and abroad, also made the calculation of risk on the part of the lender more difficult than ever. Westpac, for instance, handed over large sums to George Herscu for his madcap American adventures. Herscu's 1985 
138 
THE EIGHTIES 
takeover of Hooker Corporation, Australia's second-largest property com- pany, was the prelude to an ambitious course of speculative investment in Australia and especially the United States that eventually destroyed the com- pany and sent Herscu bankrupt. When the company collapsed, its debts to about seventy-five banks amounted to $2 billion; Westpac alone was down $200 million. But Herscu's disastrous shopping mall projects in the United States reflected the extravagance of his personal taste. The lavish opening of the massive Forest Fair mall outside Cincinnati in March 1989 was attended by 70,000 people, with Herscu's favourite singer, Marie Osmond, providing the entertainment. A band played 'Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport. George Herscu, too, was in his own way taking Australia to the world.69 
ANZ, which had lost its exclusive status as the Fairfax banker in 1983, may well have provided the 26-year-old business novice Warwick Fairfax with a vast loan as a way of restoring its standing with the great company. It is otherwise difficult to explain the bank's apparent madness in funding the young man's takeover of the family business. Warwick, fresh from Oxford, Harvard Business School, the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Los Angeles Times, was determined to take control of a company he believed to be his rightful inheritance. Sir Warwick, his father, had died earlier in 1987 and Young Warwick's shy older half-brother James had for a decade been a fine chairman of the board. 
Young Warwick's interests, according to his mother, Lady Mary, were Jesus and journalism; he had a close relationship with a number of other ear- nest young Christians whom he had met at Oxford.70 His head full of the latest business management theories, Warwick had quietly devised a scheme to seize control of the company in collaboration with his mother and a coterie of public relations men, advisers to the family and plausible deal-makers - the most plausible of them all being the WA banker Laurie Connell, who was promised an astronomical fee of $100 million in return for his dubious ser- vices. Even as originally devised, the deal was risky, since it assumed that members of the Fairfax family with shares in the company would hold on to them and willingly accept Warwick's control. Instead, they sold their shares at the high price being offered through the bid, which meant Warwick needed additional finance to buy them out. Meanwhile, even before the takeover was accomplished, the stock market collapsed in October 1987, slashing share prices across the board, but Warwick persisted in the bid, therefore paying pre-collapse prices, ANZ eventually lent him $2 billion. Those who sold their Fairfax shares made a killing in a depressed market, and Warwick had to start

selling off assets in the very same depressed market to refinance the bid. Young merchant bankers getting their start such as Malcolm Turnbull hov- ered around the dying elephant, collecting millions of dollars in fees as they helped it over this or that hump by locating emergency finance."1 
Australia's oldest and greatest media company spent the early 1990s in receivership, a century and a half of Fairfax family control coming to an end. While the poor judgment of Warwick and his mother was primarily respon- sible, without the acquisitive takeover culture of the 1980s, and without a lender such as ANZ being willing to hand over such a vast sum, Warwick may well have been content to join his friends on a Christian commune and live off the dividends from his shareholding. At the very least, he might have spent a decade learning a little about the family business; the chairmanship of the company was likely to have eventually fallen to him given the struc- ture of the family's share ownership. A joke that did the rounds asked: how do you create a small business in Australia? Answer: you give a large busi- ness to Warwick Fairfax, 
Fairfax was perhaps the most prominent example of an 'establishment' business destroyed in the new economic climate of the 1980s, although it was not unique in this respect. Adsteam - the venerable Adelaide Steamship Company, established in 1875 - which was run by a Latvian migrant named John Spalvins, experienced a period of massive expansion in the 1980s before falling apart in the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash. Spalvins, who had married into the Adelaide establishment, borrowed heavily in building up a company that included such businesses as Woolworths and David Jones as well as large shareholdings in the trading banks. The various entities in the Adsteam group were buying shares from one another, pushing up the share price, paying each other dividends recorded as profits, and then borrowing heavily on the increased paper value of the stock. Spalvins's gam- bling on the options market against Holmes à Court also led to huge losses, contributing to the eventual collapse of his group."2 
- 
While the big banks were more than pleased to compete for the busi- ness of corporate adventurers of this kind so long as the boom lasted, at the riskier edges of the financial market there were the cowboys such as Con- nell called 'Last Resort Laurie' on account of his reputation for lending money to unfortunates refused by everyone else - and the Melbourne mer- chant bank Tricontinental's brash young chief, Ian Johns. Owned but not controlled by the State Bank of Victoria, Trico deliberately courted riskier lenders on a course of rapid growth. Its stated assets grew by 101 per cent 
140 
THE EIGHTIES 
in the year to 1986 and a further 32 per cent to 1987, by which time they stood at $2.6 billion, making it officially the country's largest merchant bank. Trico's apparent success won for Ian Johns the Young Businessman of the Year Award in 1986. One of the award's judges was Christopher Skase, a favourite client.73 
The blinking computer screens in bank offices across the country hinted at a mathematical sophistication in assessing risk; the reality was very different. Banks lent millions of dollars to a non-government organisation in Victoria, the National Safety Council (NSCV), on the security of empty crates that its chief had managed to persuade bankers were full of expensive equipment. The NSCV, founded in 1927 to promote road and industrial safety, was led by a shadowy figure who called himself John Friedrich. He later turned out to be an illegal immigrant named Friedrich Johann Hohenberger, who had arrived by plane in January 1975 after faking his death when caught embez- zling from his employer in his native West Germany. After spending time working in Aboriginal communities, Friedrich applied successfully for a position with the NSCV. He quickly rose through the organisation to become its chief in 1982. His salary eventually climbed to $130,000, although he lived a modest lifestyle with his Australian wife and children on a property near the NSCV's base at Sale in Gippsland.74 
Friedrich, described later as 'an affable, motivated workaholic, was able to transform his sleepy outfit into a sophisticated search-and-rescue organ- isation by fraudulently borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars and eliciting the assistance of a few friendly businesses that helped him cook the books, 75 
His frauds were intended to build up the NSCV and so feed his narcissism; they were not for his personal financial benefit." Partly organ- ised on paramilitary lines, the NSCV at the time of its collapse in 1989 had assets including a fleet of 22 helicopters, 10 fixed-wing planes, a 42-metre flagship, a midget submarine, search and rescue boats, a vast array of vehi- cles, decompression chambers, computer equipment, an infra-red scanner and much else that was shiny, flashy and expensive. Pigeons were being pre- pared for search-and-rescue missions, dogs to be parachuted with their handlers into remote areas to look for missing people. Friedrich enjoyed surrounding himself with fit young men - some of whom he rewarded with expensive cars - and he was especially proud of the elite para-rescue group, or PJs (parachute jumpers), as they were known.
