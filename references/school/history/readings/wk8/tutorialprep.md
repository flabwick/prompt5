(i) The Prices and Incomes Accord:
The Accord was central to the Hawke government’s strategy to end the recession and control inflation. It represented a cooperative framework with the ACTU to restrain wage demands in exchange for social wage benefits. The reading highlights its political symbolism and practical role in stabilising the economy early in the decade, although later pressures from fiscal discipline and business deregulation began to strain union relations.

(ii) Floating the Dollar:
Bongiorno provides a detailed account of the float’s rationale and implementation. The old system of pegged exchange rates was increasingly unworkable amid global financial changes, speculation, and capital flows. The December 1983 float was a response to a currency crisis, intended to stabilise monetary policy, enhance market credibility, and align Australia with international financial norms. Internal debates, particularly between Keating, Hawke, Stone, and the RBA, reveal political tensions and strategic urgency.

(iii) Economic Difficulties and Government Response:
Australia faced high inflation, a current account deficit, and slow recovery from recession. The Hawke government used the Accord, fiscal restraint via the Expenditure Review Committee, and sweeping deregulation (especially in banking and foreign exchange) to manage these challenges. Structural reform, budget discipline, and confidence-building with financial markets became dominant themes.

(iv) Business Response to Economic Change:
The business community embraced deregulation, financial liberalisation, and globalisation. This ushered in a wave of entrepreneurship, mergers, speculative capital flows, and asset inflation. Entrepreneurs like Keating, Elliott, and Holmes à Court capitalised on deregulated markets. However, Bongiorno critiques the lack of regulatory oversight and the culture of excess, which foreshadowed the late-decade bust.

(v) Rise of Neoliberalism/Economic Rationalism:
The float and deregulation became emblematic of Australia’s embrace of neoliberalism. Economic rationalism was adopted pragmatically by Labor to appeal to markets, distancing from traditional protectionism. While the political class celebrated market-oriented reforms, party rank-and-file and unions often expressed disillusionment, especially over deregulation, foreign bank entry, and tariff reductions.

(vi) Cabinet Submission 6227 (March 1989):
Though not explicitly named in the excerpt, the broader economic context around this period—marked by deregulation, speculative booms, and rising interest rates—reflects the themes likely present in such a submission. It would have advised continued fiscal restraint and reform, warning against complacency amid market volatility, as the government sought to maintain credibility and economic stability.

(i) Prices and Incomes Accord
The reading doesn’t directly detail the Accord but situates it in a broader economic culture of the 1980s: speculative investment, asset inflation, and corporate excess. These excesses—enabled by deregulated finance—were what the Accord aimed to contain indirectly by controlling wages and inflation while securing union cooperation.

(ii) Floating the Dollar
The floating of the dollar is touched on through multiple references to deregulation, including Keating’s central role. The shift allowed Australia to better absorb international shocks and fit within a globalising financial environment. Submission 6227 (March 1989) is likely tied to managing post-float volatility, though the reading doesn’t quote it directly.

(iii) Economic Difficulties and Federal Response
The reading highlights speculative booms, reckless lending, and corporate collapses (e.g., Hooker, Fairfax, Adsteam) as core challenges. The federal government’s response included deregulation (e.g., float of the dollar), reduced protection, and reliance on monetary policy to manage risk—underpinned by neoliberal ideology.

(iv) Business Response to Change
Business figures like Bond, Elliott, and Holmes à Court embodied the aggressive takeover culture, driven by easy finance and global ambition. Traditional firms collapsed or were absorbed, and advertising, branding, and national identity were reshaped around a new corporate culture.

(v) Rise of Neoliberalism/Economic Rationalism
Neoliberalism rose from disillusionment with protectionism and Keynesianism. The reading showcases how deregulation, risk-taking, and speculative finance aligned with a belief in markets over state controls. Banks and financiers supported this shift, fuelling rapid—but fragile—growth.

(vi) Submission 6227 and Cabinet Advice (March 1989)
Although not quoted in full, the reading references events surrounding 1989—especially collapses like Friedrich’s NSCV and Hooker—that underscored systemic risks. Submission 6227 likely warned Cabinet of unsustainable lending and asset inflation, advising restraint and tighter financial oversight.

Engagement with the Questions Based on Cabinet Submission 6227

(i) Prices and Incomes Accord:
The submission acknowledges the Wage/Tax Trade-Off (WTT), part of the broader Accord framework, as pivotal in curbing inflation and avoiding a wage blowout. By 1989, however, the Accord was seen as under strain, with rising demand pressures threatening to undermine wage restraint. The focus shifted from achieving inflation reductions to simply preventing wage acceleration, reflecting the limits of the Accord’s effectiveness under booming economic conditions.

(ii) Floating the Dollar:
While the float is not discussed directly, the submission’s emphasis on managing external imbalances through monetary and fiscal policy reflects a post-float environment. The flexible exchange rate required internal policy tools to control demand, inflation, and the current account—indirectly affirming the rationale for floating: to let market forces adjust the dollar while internal policies managed macroeconomic stability.

(iii) 1980s Economic Difficulties and Government Response:
The document identifies excessive domestic demand, persistent current account deficits, and stubborn inflation as central challenges. The government’s response included a strongly contractionary fiscal policy, tight monetary settings (with 90-day bill rates reaching 17%), structural reforms, and attempts to control wage growth. These aimed to cool the economy without abandoning the broader reform agenda.

(iv) Business Response to Economic Change:
The reading suggests that business responded positively to the government’s reform program, with strong private investment, especially in tradable sectors. Structural reforms and wage restraint improved corporate profitability and employment growth, indicating business alignment with the government’s shift toward competitiveness and efficiency.

(v) Rise of Neoliberalism/Economic Rationalism:
The submission embodies economic rationalist thinking: fiscal discipline, reduced public spending, asset sales, structural reforms, and a preference for market-driven efficiency. The goal of zero net PSBR and the emphasis on restraining state borrowing underline the neoliberal orientation, reinforcing the era’s ideological shift away from Keynesian interventionism.

(vi) Message from Treasurer in Submission 6227 (March 1989):
Keating urged Cabinet to stay the course on macroeconomic policy while increasing flexibility and structural reform. He warned of overheating from excessive demand, stressed the need to prevent a wage breakout, and proposed maintaining strong fiscal discipline, possibly enhancing it. His advice was to reinforce credibility through continued restraint, asset sales, and minimal new spending, while integrating fiscal, monetary, and structural reforms to stabilize the economy and secure long-term prosperity.


# 60minutes
(i) Prices and Incomes Accord
The interview references the government’s tight fiscal and wages policies as part of the broader strategy to manage an overheating economy. This reflects the Accord’s intent: cooperation with unions to control wages in exchange for social benefits, aiming to curb inflation and maintain employment.

(ii) Dollar Float
Though not directly mentioned, the emphasis on transforming Australia into a modern, export-driven economy with manufacturing growth and foreign market integration aligns with the rationale behind floating the dollar in 1983: improving competitiveness and allowing market-driven adjustments.

(iii) 1980s Economic Difficulties and Government Response
The interview highlights high interest rates, inflation, corporate collapses, and foreign debt. The government responded with tight monetary and fiscal policies to cool demand, structural reforms, investment in manufacturing, superannuation expansion, and employment-focused growth strategies. Keating notes the economy’s rapid expansion and capital stock growth as long-term solutions.

(iv) Business Response to Economic Changes
Keating discusses increased manufacturing exports, including steel, cars, and optical lenses, suggesting that business adapted by modernising and engaging more with global markets. The transformation from an “agrarian runt” to an industrial economy shows business leveraging reforms to compete internationally.

(v) Rise of Neoliberalism/Economic Rationalism
The government’s focus on fiscal restraint, monetary tightening, industrial competitiveness, and reduced union influence points to neoliberal reforms. The interview frames these changes as necessary corrections after decades of neglect, showcasing economic rationalism as a guiding principle.

(vi) Submission 6227 (March 1989)
Not explicitly mentioned in the interview. However, the tone and content reflect the type of economic urgency and policy justification that likely appeared in such Cabinet submissions—especially in the defense of tight policy settings despite short-term pain.
