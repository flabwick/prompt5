CONSIDERATION OF THE ISSUES 
The Government's macroeconomic and structural policies have 
achieved considerable success in a number of areas. We have an economy with many of the features we have sought: 
a structural transformation in the fiscal position; 
flat public spending; 
moderate private consumption; 
sustained real wage restraint and very healthy 
corporate profits; 
strong private investment across the board, with a lot happening in tradeable activities. Indeed, investment is stronger relative to GDP than in either of the two major resource development cycles in the 1960s and 
1970s; and 
outstanding employment growth, overwhelmingly in the 
private sector. 
The global economy has also proven very robust and the already long expansion phase is forecast to continue for some 
time yet. 
2. 
The main problem facing the Australian economy is, in a 
nutshell, that it has been too buoyant: 
3. 
so, despite a very welcome recovery in export prices 
and the terms of trade, the current account deficit has 
not narrowed as it must; and 
price inflation has not come down anything like we had 
hoped. 
While some of the budget's forecasts are now not going to be met, this does not mean that our broad policy strategy or framework is wrong. It isn't. Rather it is a question of doing more within that framework to ensure that a protracted period of overly strong demand pressures does not eat into the fundamental changes that our policies have wrought and 
jeopardise the continuation of our strategy. If that can be avoided Australia can emerge from this overly strong 
investment boom with fundamentals which will underpin 
prosperity through the 1990s. 
4. 
As 1988 unfolded our policies were indeed adjusted in just this way and, at the time of the 1988-89 Budget, there 
was a good chance that with the Wage/Tax Trade-Off (WTT) in 
Cabinet-In-Confidence 
Cabinet-In-Confidence 
3 
prospect for 1989-90, the final pieces - inflation and the external accounts would fit into place. Since then, however, the buoyancy of the economy has been much stronger than envisaged. As evidence of the additional strength of demand pressures has come to hand, we have tightened monetary policy. Its progressive tightening since the June quarter last year is now such that 90 day bills are around 
17 per cent compared with an average of 10.8 per cent in 
February last year. 
5 
The pronounced tightening in monetary policy is beginning to have some effects in slowing demand in the housing and construction sector. The full effects of past monetary policy tightening will be coming through with growing force as 1989 progresses, and we can expect an easing in demand pressures during the course of 1989. However the strength of demand and its ability to date to weather a marked tightening in monetary policy has been surprising and there must be some uncertainty as to whether the current degree of tightness will slow demand sufficiently. 
6. 
On the other hand we need to be alert to the fact that monetary policy operates with a lag and that much of the tightening has occurred very recently. 
7. In any case monetary policy needs to be operated in a flexible manner so as to secure a slowdown in demand and imports which will be sufficiently marked to generate an acceptable current account deficit for 1989-90. 
8. Fiscal policy has been tightened very dramatically over recent years and is now strongly contractionary with the Commonwealth budget in heavy surplus. In these circumstances it is appropriate that monetary policy deal with a surge in demand that is not broadly based and which is concentrated in those areas of the economy which are interest rate sensitive. Private consumption remains moderate and public outlays continue to decline and it would be inequitable and unnecessary for fiscal policy to be tightened further in any dramatic way at this time. 
Cabinet-In-Confidence 
Cabinet-In-Confidence 
9. Nevertheless it is very important that fiscal policy continue to act as a restraining influence on demand and we must maintain fully the strength of fiscal policy and 
possibly do a little more. 
10. For some time, we have recognised that this year would be pivotal in terms of seeking major improvements in wage determination arrangements. The growing pressures evident throughout most sectors of the economy have now clearly reduced the prospects for securing a significant step-down in inflation from the WTT this year. Indeed, the WTT must now 
concentrate on helping to prevent a serious acceleration in wages. This would be a significant achievement in historical terms. Beyond that, of course, we must concentrate on getting in place an award restructuring framework which can withstand pressures for a rapid and large general wage round and which makes a lasting improvement in the industrial relations system. 
11. The need to spread out the impact of the award restructuring so as to achieve a wages outcome next year no greater than that for this year must be a prime consideration 
in our wage tax negotiations. 
12. 
A hallmark of our policy approach has been to look to integrate macroeconomic policy and structural reforms. Macroeconomic policies can help to provide the best environment for structural reform by maintaining growth of employment and investment, but demand should not be so 
buoyant as to reward also the least efficient and fan 
inflation. It is the structural characteristics of the 
economy which ultimately determine its performance potential. I believe that we must aggressively continue to pursue opportunities for structural reform across a broad 
front. We must maintain momentum so that business and the workforce continue to respond. Key opportunities in terms of public perceptions and economic effects - will arise in the next few months with reports on the waterfront and coastal shipping and continuing government business

enterprise reforms. 
There 
Reform in each of these areas offers 
scope for considerable improvement in competitiveness. will be major IAC reports to which we will have the opportunity to respond: on government (non-tax) charges, international trade in services, travel and tourism, and food processing. Consideration needs to be given to announcing further initiatives from our structural reform agenda as part of the April Statement. 
13. Before addressing more specifically the 1989-90 Budget outlook, I reiterate that the task ahead does not require a change to the thrust of our economic policy framework. it does require a flexibility and determination on our part to ensure that our structural policies proceed and that we do not allow the recent surge in demand to destabilise our macroeconomic framework. In a nutshell our task is to avoid a wages blowout and return the current account deficit to an acceptable downward trend. 
14. 
PRELIMINARY 1989-90 BUDGET OUTLOOK 
The table below presents the results of the mid-year review of the 1988-89 Budget together with some very preliminary estimates for 1989-90; the latter estimates are based on economic parameters that could change significantly 
over the months ahead:

15, Those estimates suggest we are starting this year's budget round from a satisfactory position. This reflects the favourable outyear effects of previous budget decisions to contain outlays and to restore the integrity of the tax 
system.

16. That starting point will be very substantially reduced. 
of course, by the foreshadowed tax cuts and associated 
increases in family assistance. The acceptable scope of those costs to the Budget will, within limits, be dependent 
on what can be obtained on the wages front and our own expenditures. In any event, the fiscal outcome after the WTT must contribute to lower pressures on the external account from excessive domestic demand, as well as to reducing the 
burden on monetary policy. It will not be easy to balance 
all these objectives. However, at this stage, I consider 
that we should be aiming for: 
a further real reduction in budget outlays; and 
this year's zero net PSBR must be repeated or bettered. 
17. So far as the Commonwealth sector is concerned, a zero 
net PSBR would require continued restraint in Commonwealth authorities' borrowing programs in the face of ongoing aircraft and other re-equipment programs. There will also be an overwhelming requirement to seek to match new policy 
initiatives by offsetting savings. Indeed, we should begin 
the Budget round looking to achieve further savings on 
Commonwealth outlays; not least to counter the prospective large increase (currently at 2 1/2 per cent) in the forward 
estimates for 1990-91. 
18. There is merit in announcing some expenditure saving decisions for 1989-90 in the April statement on the WTT, which could affect some of the new family assistance 
spending. Such decisions would provide a further signal to the community that the Government has not shifted in its resolve to maintain the fiscal consolidation process of recent years, and that the period of restraint is not over. Some positive references in that Statement to assets sales would also help in the same way. 
In recent years, the Commonwealth has achieved 
significant savings in payments to the States and has also achieved significant reductions in the States' global 
borrowing limits. I have already indicated to the States 
that this restraint will continue to be applied by the Commonwealth next financial year. However, savings in payments to the States next financial year will not be as 
great as they have been in recent years. That only serves to underline the importance of not easing-up on the 
Commonwealth's own outlays

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
The months ahead will require further hard economic policy decisions not only in preparation for the 1989-90 Budget but across the full range of monetary, wages and structural policies. Progress in facilitating external adjustment and combatting inflation must remain paramount. That will necessarily require policies directed at moderating domestic demand pressures and enhancing our productive capacity. Against that background, I recommend that 
Ministers:

PSBR in 1989-90; and 
resolve to address policies, especially those of a structural kind, which reinforce and contribute to our broader economic objectives.

ATTACHMENT A 
The Department of Finance is in general agreement with the 
submission's recommendation. In particular, it strongly 
supports the need to achieve a real reduction in budget 
outlays and a net PSBR at a zero or negative level and 
notes that such outcomes are likely to leave little or no 
scope for net new policy in the 1989-90 Budget. 
Finance supports also the conclusions of Memorandum 6228 
which seeks continued restraint at State level. Finance 
notes that this objective will be more readily achieved if 
restraint in outlays on the Commonwealth's own behalf is in 
line with that expected for the State sector and for public sector demand generally. 
Finance notes that the better the outcome achieved on the net PSBR, the better the balance between fiscal and monetary policy and thus the lower the potential for monetary policy 
unduly to suppress much needed investment.
