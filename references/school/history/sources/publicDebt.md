A history of public debt in Australia  Katrina Di Marco, Mitchell Pirie and Wilson Au-Yeung1 
Understanding debt and its historical trends is important, as the level of debt provides one  measure of the strength of public finances. Levels of public sector borrowing fluctuate in line with  the economic cycle and the budget position. This paper briefly describes the various measures  of debt and trends in government borrowing.

A history of public debt in Australia  
Introduction  
Understanding debt and its historical trends is important, as the level of debt provides  one measure of the strength of public finances. Governments’ borrowings to finance a  budget deficit are collectively referred to as public debt. Over time, government  borrowings add to the stock of public debt, but may finance things such as purchases  of assets.  
This article provides a brief analysis of Australia’s public debt. It describes the various  ways of measuring public debt and what these measures tell us about the strength of  the government’s finances. The article summarises the history of Australia’s public  debt, for both the Australian and State governments.  
Concepts of debt  
Before analysing historical trends in Australia’s public debt, it is important to  understand the concepts of gross debt and net debt and what information they  provide.  
Gross debt  
Gross debt represents a portion of the total liability a government owes to creditors.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Government Finance Statistics (GFS) manual  defines gross debt as:  
All liabilities that require payment or payments of interest and/or principal by  the debtor to the creditor at a date or dates in the future. Thus, all liabilities in  the GFS system are debt except for shares and other equity and financial  derivatives [paragraph 7.142].  
The main component of gross debt on the Australian Government’s balance sheet is  Commonwealth Government Securities (Treasury Bonds) outstanding.  
While the gross debt measure provides information on government finances, it is only  a partial indicator. Gross debt does not incorporate amounts that are owed to  government by other parties. Also governments, like an individuals or businesses,  hold assets which can be sold to meet their financial obligations. To capture the asset  side of equation, net debt needs to be considered.

Net debt  
Broadly speaking, net debt is equal to gross debt less a related pool of financial assets.2 Table 1 gives a simple representation of the main components that are included and  excluded from the Australian Government’s net debt calculation.

Net debt is the most commonly quoted and well-known measure of a government’s  financial strength. One of the reasons is that it is part of everyday life for businesses  and households. Another reason is that, historically, it was the only available stock  measure for governments who were recording financial information in a cash-based  accounting system. Finally, it is a measure that is internationally comparable, given  most OECD countries report on it.  
Compared with gross debt, net debt is a better measure of a government’s overall  indebtedness as it also captures the amount of debt owed to the government. Still, like  gross debt, net debt is only a partial indicator of the government’s financial strength, as  not all government assets or liabilities are included. As an example, unfunded  superannuation is not included in the calculation of net debt. On the other side of the  ledger, the equity holdings of the Future Fund are also not included as an asset in the  calculation of net debt.  
International comparisons of net debt and gross debt  
Chart 1 compares the gross debt and net debt position of the general government  sector in the G-7 countries.  
  
2 In terms of the Australian Government’s balance sheet, net debt equals the sum of deposits  held, advances received, government securities, loans and other borrowing, minus the sum  of cash and deposits, advances paid, and investments, loans and placements.

The case of Japan most clearly illustrates how only considering gross debt can result in  a skewed interpretation of government finances. Using the gross debt measure, Japan,  at 173 per cent of GDP, appears to have the highest debt level of the G7, well above the  level of Italy. When the net debt measure is used, Japan and Italy have similar net  debt- to-GDP ratios.  
Similarly Canada, which has a comparable amount of gross debt to France, Germany  and the US, has a significantly lower level of net debt than those countries.  
The examples illustrate that care needs to be taken when using gross debt to compare  across countries and over time.  
International comparisons of net debt over time  
Australia has had historically low levels of net debt over the past two decades  compared with the G-7 economies (Chart 2). In the early 1990s, Australia, along with  the major economies, experienced an increase in net debt largely because of the global  downturn. But in contrast to other economies, after 1995, Australia experienced a  significant fall in its net debt.  
In the period ahead, the net debt positions of the major OECD economies, including  Australia, are again expected to grow as a result of the deteriorating global economic  outlook and the need to introduce significant fiscal stimulus measures. The capacities  of governments to respond to the deteriorating global economic outlook will be

different. These differences in capacity largely stem from differences in the initial  strength of government finances and differences in the capacity of economies to grow.3

Net debt figures are from  the OECD Economic Outlook 84 except for Australia’s 2010 figure which is the sum of the most recent  forecasts for Australian, State and Territory general government sector net debt levels for financial year  2009-10.  
Chart 2 reinforces Australia’s relatively strong position with significantly lower levels  of net debt projected in 2010 than the G-7 countries, even after introducing stimulus  measures. Australia’s projected net debt position, across all Government’s is estimated  to be 1 per cent of GDP compared with 48 per cent of GDP for the OECD.4  
Other measures of financial position  
Over time, the demand for greater public accountability has led governments to  publish more comprehensive sets of fiscal data. This has resulted in a trend towards  using accrual accounting measures. By introducing a balance sheet into the primary  Budget documents from 1999-2000, the Australian Government has been able to  measure net financial worth and net worth.  
  
3 These are factors that ratings agencies consider. For a useful summary see Moody’s Special  Comment, How far can Aaa governments stretch their balance sheets?, February 2009.  4 The OECD figure has not been updated from the OECD Economic Outlook 84 published in  November 2008. This figure is expected to be higher given the further deterioration of the  global outlook and further stimulatory measures announced by governments.

• Net financial worth is defined as total financial assets less total liabilities.  • Net worth is defined as total assets less total liabilities.  
Both measures are conceptually better than gross debt and net debt at capturing the  Australian Government’s financial strength, as they are more comprehensive.  
The difference between the two measures is the inclusion of non-financial assets in net  worth. Given concerns surrounding the valuation of non-financial assets and their  liquidity in the face of adverse shocks, the Australian Government has decided to use  net financial worth as its primary indicator of balance sheet sustainability.5

Colonial gross debt (pre-Federation)  
At different times in Australia’s history, governments have had to borrow to fund  cyclical revenue shortfalls or to finance large infrastructure projects.  
During the period 1850-1900 colonial governments played a central role in the  construction of economic infrastructure. According to Butlin, Blanchard and Pincus  (1982), between 1860 and 1900, public expenditure accounted for 40 per cent of  domestic capital formation.  
A large share of the capital expenditure was financed through borrowing, with gross  debt rising from around 3 per cent of GDP in 1855 to around 100 per cent of GDP in  1900 (Chart 3). A very small stock of local capital meant that public borrowing,  through the issuance of securities, was largely undertaken in London (Attard 2007).  The securities that were issued, which were colloquially known as ‘Colonial Consols’,  traded at yields well below comparable securities offered by the Australian private  sector (Butlin, Blanchard and Pincus 1982).  
Between 1856 and 1880, on average around 73 per cent of Australia’s colonial debt was  issued in London (Chart 4).

For the first decade following Federation, the Australian Government did not have any  public debt as budget revenues exceeded outlays. The first debt recorded on the  Australian Government’s balance sheet was debt transferred from South Australia on  1 January 1911, when the administration of the Northern Territory and the Port  Augusta to Oodnadatta railway was passed to the Australian Government (Australian  Office of Financial Management (AOFM) 2003-04).  
The first public bond issue in Australia was conducted in 1915 as part of financing the  First World War (AOFM 2003-04). Foreign borrowing also played an important role in  the raising of debt in the years prior to the Second World War (Box 1).  
During the First World War, gross Australian Government debt increased from around  2.2 per cent of GDP to around 50 per cent of GDP (Chart 5), with around one-third of  this increase met through loans issued in London (AOFM 2003-04). By comparison  with the First World War, the financing requirements of the Second World War were  met largely through domestic borrowing. Gross Australian Government debt  increased from around 40 per cent of GDP in 1939 to around 120 per cent of GDP in  1945. During both wars, War Savings Certificates, targeted at retail investors, were the  primary instruments used to raise funds.

Australian Government debt was progressively reduced after the Second World War  and largely eliminated by the beginning of the 1970s. In the decade following the  Second World War, relatively tight fiscal policy halted the growth in gross debt, while  high inflation underpinned the sharp reduction in gross debt as a share of GDP. By  1974, gross debt had declined to around 8 per cent of GDP from a peak of around  120 per cent of GDP in 1946.  
There were two further episodes of debt accumulation, and subsequent reduction,  during the 1980s and early 1990s driven by periods of weak economic growth and  associated budget deficits. From the mid-1990s, as the Australian Government’s fiscal  position improved, gross debt declined steadily as a share of GDP.  
  
6 Care needs to be taken when making comparisons over time due to structural breaks in the  series. These include the move from cash to accrual accounting and the change to  market-to-market accounting for debt.

Box 1: Australian Government foreign currency debt  
The Australian Government historically had a significant proportion of its debt  denominated in foreign currencies, but foreign-denominated debt is now negligible  (Chart A).  
For the first 30 years after Federation, foreign currency debt made up around  35 per cent of total debt on issue. A large portion of this debt was financed from  London. Between 1940 and 1950 the amount of foreign currency debt fell as domestic  markets grew in size. After the Second World War, the value of foreign currency loans  began to rise to finance balance of payment deficits (AOFM 2002-03).  
The share of foreign currency borrowings of the Commonwealth Government  Securities (CGS) portfolio remained around 30 per cent from 1970 until 1988. In 1988,  the Government decided to concentrate debt issuance in domestic markets to maintain  liquidity and efficiency.  
Capital account liberalisation has underpinned an increase in foreign holdings of  Australian dollar-denominated CGS since the early 1980s (Chart B).

Trends in Australian Government net debt  
There has only been a formal recording of net debt data for the Australian Government  since 1988. The Treasury has developed a net debt series for 1972-88 to allow better  comparison across time (Treasury 1996).  
Chart 6 shows that the Australian Government has historically had a positive net debt  position — that is, the value of debt liabilities has exceeded the value of debt assets.  Since 1970-71, net debt has averaged 5.7 per cent of GDP, reaching a peak of  18.5 per cent in 1995-96, and a low of -3.8 per cent of GDP in 2007-08. Changes in net  debt have largely been driven by changes in the government’s budget position.7 
Especially in the 1990s, asset sales have also been a significant contributing factor  (Box 2).

During the early 1970s net debt was mainly negative and reached lows of -3.1 per cent  of GDP. During the first half of the 1970s budget surpluses averaged 1.7 per cent of  GDP, while in the second half, there were budget deficits averaging around —  1.6 per cent of GDP. By 1979-80, net debt was around 4.7 per cent of GDP.

A history of public debt in Australia  
Net debt reached 10.4 per cent of GDP in 1985-86. It took only three years (from  1986-87 to 1989-90) to reduce net debt by around 6 percentage points of GDP. Across  those same years, the underlying cash balance averaged around 0.6 per cent of GDP.  
During this same period, the current account deficit was on the rise and reducing the  Government’s call on foreign capital was an important driver of fiscal policy  (Kennedy, Luu, Morling and Yeaman 2004). As a result, in 1988, the government  decided to concentrate its debt issuance in Australian dollars (Box 1). In 1987,  30 per cent of total borrowings were in foreign currencies. By 1990-91 it was around  21 per cent.  
In the early 1990s recessions in many advanced economies caused a marked slowing in  the world economy. The government implemented a more expansionary fiscal policy  that was funded by borrowing. Net debt reached a peak of 18.5 per cent of GDP in  1995-96.  
From 1995-96 onwards, the government undertook a program of fiscal consolidation  (Kennedy, Luu, Morling and Yeaman 2004). The government also undertook  significant sales of Public Trading Enterprises around this period (Box 2).  
The combination of successive budget surpluses and asset sales led to the elimination  of net debt. Net debt as a proportion of GDP gradually declined to its historical low of  -3.8 per cent of GDP in 2007-08.

Box 2: Sale of major Commonwealth Publicly Traded Enterprises  (PTEs)8 
The Australian Government started a program of asset sales in 1987. These sales  were largely conducted through trade sales (which involves a tendering process) or  through public offerings of equity. The early asset sales were largely contained to  property rather than PTEs. This changed in the early 1990s, with a marked increase  in the sale proceeds from PTEs (Table A).

Cumulative budget surpluses and proceeds from the sale of major PTEs,  contributed to reducing net debt to its low of -3.8 per cent of GDP in 2007-08 from  its peak in 1995-96. Of this, PTE sales contributed around $61 billion, to reduce net  debt. Chart A shows the proceeds of PTE sales as a share of GDP from 1987-88.

Recent trends in state net debt  
The ratio of aggregate state net debt to GDP declined steadily from the early 1990s  until 2006-07, as state governments adopted fiscal strategies to reduce debt levels  primarily through expenditure restraint but also through revenue increases and asset  sales. Chart 7 illustrates recent trends in aggregate state net debt-to-GDP ratios  (Budget Paper No. 3 2008-09).  
Since 1998-99 states have been running an aggregate general government sector  positive net operating balance. This illustrates that state borrowing, in aggregate, has  not been occurring to fund recurrent expenditure. State borrowing chiefly occurs in the  public non-financial corporations sector, where it relates to infrastructure required by  those government-owned corporations to deliver the services they provide.  
From 2006-07 state- and local-level non-financial public sector net debt began trending  upwards, primarily reflecting the financing of state government infrastructure projects,  particularly by public non-financial corporations.

A history of public debt in Australia  
Conclusion  
A government’s balance sheet comprises both assets and liabilities. This article has  demonstrated that only considering gross debt can result in an incomplete picture of  public finances. By taking into account assets the public sector owns, a more accurate  view of a government’s ability to respond to economic conditions can be determined.  
This article has shown that Australia has undergone several periods of debt  accumulation, followed by periods of fiscal consolidation. Periods of strong economic  growth following episodes of debt accumulation have helped support relatively quick  improvements in the public sector’s net debt position. Australia has a low level of net  debt both historically and when compared with G-7 economies.
