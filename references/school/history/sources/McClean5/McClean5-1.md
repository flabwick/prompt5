CHAPTER 5 
Becoming Very Rich 
Th ere is this peculiarity in gold, as an object of industry, that the quest of it dis 
turbs all other adjacent industries. 
— Anthony Trollope, visiting Victoria in 18711 
In 1851 the discovery of gold delivered a major shock to the predominantly  pastoral economy of Australia and ushered in a dramatic episode in the history  of the country’s prosperity. Considered in relation to the size of the economy  it triggered the largest economic disruption ever experienced. And though an  economic shock by origin, its eff ects quickly permeated the social, political,  and even cultural spheres, some so deeply that their impression has lasted to  the present. Th e importance of gold in domestic and international fi nance at  the time made Australia akin to some of today’s oil producers. Like a mid nineteenth century Gulf state, a very small population found itself in posses 
sion of a signifi cant proportion of the world’s supplies of a strategic commodity.  Crucially, this commodity had the advantage that it could be produced without  the prior development of domestic manufacturing or fi nancial services, and  could be exported in an unprocessed state onto a world market that had a seem 
ingly unquenchable desire for it. Further, the gold discoveries augmented and  diversifi ed Australia’s already generously sized natural- resource endowment.  Looking forward, the rural and mining sectors were jointly to provide the basis  for much of Australia’s growth and prosperity even though farming moved well  beyond its initial concentration on wool production, and the output of the min

ing industry diversifi ed beyond copper and gold. 
Th e primary mechanism linking the gold discoveries and the increase in fu ture wealth they represented with the level of economic activity was the dra matic increase in immigration. Th e “rush” phenomenon knew few boundaries.  Th ere was no eff ective control over the movement of people across colonial  borders or from abroad, and a “national” immigration- policy regime had to  await federation in 1901. As a result, whereas in 1850 the non- indigenous  population was about 400,000, by the end of the decade it had almost tripled  and was over 1.1 million. Th e immigrants were disproportionately male and of

working age, hence the workforce expanded even faster than the population.2 Of itself, the increased participation rate accompanying the rushes would likely  have resulted in a rise in per capita income. 
Major shocks to an economy, whether positive or negative in their impact,  off er a sort of natural experiment. Th is is because periods of extreme stress  most clearly reveal the key mechanisms and complex interactions in an econ omy, whether the shock is triggered by natural calamity (e.g., drought), war, an  external event (a boom or depression originating in the world economy), or,  as in this case, a large natural resource discovery. Th ere is another reason why  economists are attracted to the study of major shocks. Some have long- lasting,  even permanent eff ects on the performance of the economy, including cases in  which the initial cause of the disturbance quickly fades. Th is persistence may  arise because path dependence and “lock- in” prevents a return to preshock eco 
nomic conditions or performance. Although the shock itself may be of limited  duration, the economy is pushed in a direction it would not otherwise have  taken, and one that cannot be reversed. I believe this to be true of the gold rush  episode. 
Th ere may also be enduring eff ects of a shock that arise from the nature of  the responses to it. A shock may “stress- test” a country’s economic institutions  and the quality of its policy- making. Indeed some economists believe that a  signifi cant determinant of current diff erences in income levels across coun 
tries can be attributed to the appropriateness of the policy responses to major  shocks.3 Th e gold rushes will not be the only example in the history of the Aus tralian economy I will look at from this perspective. A similar approach will be  adopted with respect to the 1890s depression and drought, the two world wars,  the depression of the 1930s, and the resources boom at the end of the twentieth  century. But the mid- nineteenth- century gold rush off ers an early opportunity  to explore the implications for Australian prosperity of the policy responses to  a major shock. 
Two further features of the period following the gold discoveries are of par ticular relevance. Both are treated as rather obvious in most historical accounts,  but warrant closer scrutiny here. One is that the rushes were no fl ash in the

pan. Th at is, the economic eff ects of the discoveries were sustained, not transi tory. Yet the latter outcome has oft en been characteristic of gold or other min eral discoveries in unsettled or sparsely settled territory, and did arise at a local  or regional level following some of the minor Australian discoveries (such as in  Queensland) later in the century. Th is is the phenomenon that produces ghost  mining towns. But collectively, and viewed from a national perspective, the  major discoveries in Australia had a sustained economic impact best illustrated

by those who rushed in choosing not to rush out soon aft er. Given our focus  on prosperity and its determinants, a second key feature of the gold rush is that  it constituted a favorable shock to the economy. Both extensive and intensive  growth resulted from this major addition to the country’s resource endowment.  Th at is, despite the fl ood of immigrants, per capita income was 6 percent higher  at the end than at the beginning of the 1850s.4 
Th ere were other developments during the 1850s that contributed to this  eventful decade having particular relevance to the story of Australia’s prosper ity. Th e following are illustrative but not exhaustive. Th is decade witnessed the  commencement of overseas borrowing by governments: in 1858 Victoria raised  a loan on the London capital market.5 It was also the decade in which for the  fi rst time signifi cant numbers of Asian immigrants arrived (mainly Chinese  drawn to the goldfi elds), thereby qualifying the usual shorthand description of  non- indigenous Australians as of European descent.6 And it was the decade in  which the dominance of Sydney was challenged by Melbourne: for at least the  next century and a half Australia was to have two major urban economies. Th e  gold rush also coincided with signifi cant political and constitutional changes.  Victoria and Queensland were separated from New South Wales, creating the  six colonies that are today’s six Australian states. And during the decade, re 
sponsible government was granted to fi ve of the colonies, the exception being  Western Australia, the least populous, which followed suit in 1890. Th e colo nies became, in large measure, independent political entities, with the notable  exceptions of defense and foreign relations. Th ey retained the British Crown  as head of state, and the Privy Council in London was the highest court of ap peal. Also, given the overwhelming preponderance of British among the immi grants, the Australian colonies remained culturally closely tied to the imperial  power. But they were independent in most areas relating to their economies  and to economic policy. 
As the favorable impact of the gold rush on prosperity persisted for several  decades, it is appropriate to treat the period from 1851 to 1890 as a single era of  economic expansion, rapidly increasing population, and rising incomes. Th ere fore in this chapter we will range over this entire forty- year period. No similar

4 Th is is based on a comparison of the three- year averages for 1849– 51 and 1858– 60 of real  
“white” GDP per capita reported in Butlin (1986, p. 113). Th e peak year during the decade was  1853, when per capita GDP was 32 percent above its pre- rush average. Real wages between 1850  and 1860 rose 17 percent in New South Wales, but were 8 percent lower in Victoria (Maddock  and McLean 1984, p. 1055): a weighted average for the two yields a rise of 2 percent. 
5 Th e 1858 Victorian loan was for seven million pounds. New South Wales had raised small  
amounts beginning in 1856, but these did not exceed one million pounds until 1868 (Lamb 1964). 6 Census- based estimates for 1861 record 38,742 giving China as their place of birth; this repre sents 3.4 percent of the population (Vamplew 1987, pp. 8– 9).

(or, by some measures, during) the Second World War and ended in the early  1970s, hence having a duration of twenty- fi ve to thirty years. By contrast the  
. 
most recent period of uninterrupted growth and rising prosperity since 1991  has, at the time of writing, lasted “only” twenty years. 
Th is time frame of four decades is not the one usually adopted. In the his torical literature, discussion of the long boom in the nineteenth century con ventionally begins with 1861. But there was no break in economic activity in  1861; and neither is there any basis in political or social history for marking  that year as a turning point in the country’s fortunes. Rather, the convention of  dating the beginning of the boom in 1861 results primarily from the start year  adopted in two infl uential historical studies. Comprehensive annual estimates  of Australian GDP, investment, and the balance of payments begin in 1861 in  the historical time series estimates of Noel Butlin.7 When he followed up his  statistical volume with a detailed account of the growth of the economy to the  end of the nineteenth century, he chose, unsurprisingly, to start his discussion  with the year in which his rich collection of economic statistics began— 1861.8 Th e artifi cial benchmark year has, regrettably, stuck. But we will not be bound  by it even if the range and quality of statistical evidence on the economy vastly  improves from the early 1860s. 
In the three decades aft er 1860, incomes continued to rise at the healthy clip  of 1.3 percent per annum (the average rate between 1861 and 1889). Th is was  achieved despite rapid population growth driven in part by high levels of immi gration. In 1861 the population was 1.15 million; by 1891 it had almost trebled  to reach 3.17 million. Th at is, there was rapid extensive growth at the same time  as living standards were both high and rising. Indeed, the aggregate economy  sustained a growth rate averaging 4.8 percent per annum for the entire period  from 1861 to 1889, a performance that compares favorably with the most suc 
cessful among the rapidly developing economies in recent times.9 Th e focus  here, however, is an explanation of the sustained increase in per capita income  across the forty- year boom. We defer to the next chapter an assessment of pros perity relative to that achieved during this period in those other economies with  which it is appropriate to benchmark the Australian record.

7 Butlin (1962). His choice of this year arose from its being the earliest in which suffi cient infor mation was available on economic activity for all the colonies to provide a solid basis for his  Australia- wide estimates. More than two decades later Butlin extended his exercise in historical  national accounting to cover years prior to 1861, but this encompassed a much narrower range  of indicators and was based on more fragmentary and less reliable evidence than employed in  his earlier work covering the years aft er 1860. Regrettably, there is a break in his constant- price  estimates of GDP between 1860 and 1861. See Butlin (1986) and Butlin and Sinclair (1986). 8 Butlin (1964).

The Economic Effects of Gold: Avoiding the Resource Curse 
To understand how the rush resulted in a sustained rise in prosperity, we need  to examine some aspects of its short- run eff ects. In fact, it is possible that the  initial impact of the discovery of gold on the economy was negative. Contem porary reports indicate that a sudden migration of predominantely young,  male gold seekers from other occupations and colonies caused some degree of  economic dislocation. Of course we lack the quarterly and monthly data now  available on production and employment by industry and region that would  enable a clearer picture to be drawn of what happened in those fi rst months  of the rushes. Th e pastoralists complained that they could not retain essential  workers, such as shepherds. Th ere are accounts of the marked absence of young  men among the populations of towns, suggesting that urban employment and  hence output might both have declined. Whether total output in the economy  fell depends in part on whether the adversely aff ected industries were able  quickly to fi nd substitute labor. 
But off setting this negative short- run impact was the rise in economic activ ity in Victoria directly and indirectly associated with the diggings— and not  just by the value of gold found. Further, we know this happened very quickly.  One crucial factor was the low barriers to entry in the alluvial goldfi elds. In deed, the initial rush of would- be miners only occurred because of this. All one  needed was a shovel, a pan, some food, and a tent, and, perhaps accompanied  by one or more similarly equipped colleagues, one headed to the diggings— on  horseback or even on foot. Th e alluvial nature of the initial discoveries meant  that individuals or small groups of miners could form a viable production unit.  Hence tent encampments— small towns— sprang up almost overnight at the  sites of promising gold fi nds. Th ese miners had to be fed, clothed, and supplied  with mining tools, so ancillary economic activity emerged from the beginning  of mining operations. All this activity, including the gold found, boosted eco nomic activity. 
It was about a year until the arrival of the fi rst immigrants whose decision to  migrate was made in response to the news of the gold fi nds, hence the disloca

tion was confi ned initially to churning in the domestic labor market. And there  is evidence that disappointed gold seekers returned to their homes and usual  occupations quite quickly. One can guess at the reasons for the return fl ows  beginning aft er only a short period. Some would have had access to limited  savings to sustain themselves at the diggings, and if they did not fi nd enough  gold to meet expenses would soon be driven home by fi nancial necessity. Some  would have found themselves physically unsuited to the work of mining, or  found that what they initially saw as something of an adventure quickly lost its  romantic appeal. Others would have recalibrated the risks associated with their  move to the diggings once they got there and acquired more information about  the probability of striking it rich— or of just breaking even. We should not lose

sight of the rush as a type of lottery in which there is the thrill of participation  in the small probability of signifi cant fi nancial gain, but with the crucial diff er ence from present- day lotteries that the probability distribution of outcomes  was initially unknown. A few weeks panning on a given site would change that,  with daily updates on the richness or paucity of the gold in the area. For these  reasons a “rush” to any new location could also trigger as dramatic a reverse  fl ow if glowing early reports proved spurious or exaggerated. Hence, this initial  phase of disruption to the wider economy may have been relatively short- lived. 
By 1852, with the arrival of immigrants attracted by news of the discoveries,  and with the richness of the goldfi elds confi rmed by rising production levels,  the medium- term eff ects on the economy became clearer. One helpful way to  view these is to treat the gold rushes as an example of a supply- side shock trig 
gering so- called Dutch- disease eff ects, deploying the economists’ models of such  an event. Th ese models will also prove useful during our examination of later  episodes in Australian history. Perhaps their best- known implication is the so called Gregory eff ect— the mechanism linking the expansion in the mining in dustry beginning in the 1960s with the subsequent decline in the relative size  of the manufacturing sector (deindustrialization). Th e gold rushes provide an  early illustration of the adjustments in the economy that occur in response to  this type of shock, and— more important— assist our account as to why the  
economy emerged not just signifi cantly changed but also more prosperous.10 In a pattern that was to be repeated— with some variation— over a century  later, the “resource boom” triggered by the gold discoveries led to positive ef fects for some parts of the economy during the 1850s and beyond, but had a  negative impact on others. Positively aff ected were activities directly associ ated with supplying the miners’ needs, such as food and mining equipment,  and the transport of people and supplies. In these activities, prices, wages, and  presumably profi ts all rose, drawing labor and other resources from elsewhere  in the domestic economy as well as from imports. Indeed, there may have been  higher— and less volatile— earnings made on average in these ancillary employ ments than those made by a miner. Adversely aff ected were those sectors of the  economy that lost labor to the diggings, and/or that had to pay higher wages

to retain labor but could not pass on these increased costs in higher prices. A  builder in Melbourne could recover the higher wages needed to secure trades men and building laborers because there was a boom in construction and  house prices were rising. In contrast, the pastoralist was restricted in his ability  to raise wages in order to retain stockmen tempted to seek their fortune on  the goldfi elds, as the price of wool was determined at sales in London and this  was little infl uenced by the commotion in faraway Victoria. Th is pattern of ad justments among sectors and occupations resulting from the shock of the gold

discoveries closely fi ts the pattern economists have observed following compa rable shocks or booms elsewhere.11 
With the arrival from late 1852 of large numbers of immigrants, the econ omy began a process of re- equilibration. Th e labor infl ux was so large relative to  the population that this occurred surprisingly quickly. Th e spikes in wages and  prices in the occupations and sectors most directly and favorably aff ected were  substantially reduced within a few years. Remember that this economy had no  eff ective border or immigration controls to inhibit labor infl ows. Also pertinent  to this speedy rebalancing in the economy was its institutional arrangements:  relative to a modern economy, that of the 1850s was almost totally unregulated.  Th ere were few barriers faced in establishing or operating a business or in hir 
ing or fi ring labor. In the history of the Australian economy, this surely has to  be the limiting case of great adaptability in the face of a major exogenous shock. Th e initial rise in the general price level following the discoveries was quickly  squeezed out of the macro- economy by highly responsive supplies of both im migrants and imported goods, and by the fl exibility of the labor market. Hence  there was no wage- price spiral, locking in the infl ationary spike— as would  occur following the oil price shocks in the 1970s, and bedeviling attempts to re store low infl ationary growth and stability to the economy until the early 1990s.  Other examples abound of responses to radically changed economic circum stances that assisted the postshock re- equilibration. Pastoralists exploited the  joint- product (meat and wool) attribute of their sheep by driving them to the  goldfi elds for slaughter as a result of high meat prices and in the face of a short age of shearers. Th ey also lobbied for the selective immigration of shepherds.  Building workers in Melbourne enjoyed such high demand for their labor that  they started trading that for leisure, securing an eight- hour working- day re gime.12 
Th e initial boom contained a major speculative component that could have  led to a serious bust. But this potential was avoided by the speedy downward  readjustments in product prices as imports rose and in wages as immigrants  poured in. Hence there was no bust. Pertinent to our interest in prosperity,  real income at the end of the decade had not fallen below its pre- gold levels;

there was no mass exodus of disappointed fortune seekers; and the population  continued to rise, albeit at a less hectic rate. And it should not be overlooked  that this re- equilibration occurred without a national government, and with  colonial governments in each of the aff ected colonies lacking many of the in 
stitutions and sources of advice now regarded as essential for macro- economic  management— such as a central bank and a phalanx of economists. 
11 Th ese relative price eff ects may be off set to some degree by the positive income eff ects of the  boom.

An additional reason for the economy’s successful negotiation of these fi rst  turbulent years was the absence of growth- retarding distributional confl ict.  Whatever the cultural signifi cance of the miners’ riot or rebellion in 1854, it  had little economic importance— other than as an exception highlighting the  generally peaceable fashion in which society allocated the rents from gold. Th e  critical issues of determining access to, and the distribution of returns from,  the resource discoveries were resolved in ways that provided wide opportuni ties to directly participate in the gold- seeking “lottery” and spread the indirect  benefi ts widely. Th is reduced the scope for distributional confl ict over sharing  in the benefi ts of the boom. Note that the distributional issues include inter 
generational ones. Here is the importance of diverting rents to investment in  infrastructure and assisted immigration, and borrowing abroad on the secu rity of the expected future resource riches to fund more development- oriented  projects (of which more later). 
Th e key elements in the story of how the benefi ts of the resource bonanza  were shared are well known, although their economic signifi cance is less obvi ous. Th e Victorian government at fi rst prescribed a very small claim size on the  diggings, eight feet by eight feet. One motive may have been to concentrate the  miners in as small a region as possible to reduce the costs of administration  and of maintaining law and order on the goldfi elds. Th e government’s fears of  disturbances in the mining encampments were based in part on its knowledge  of the lawlessness associated with the California gold rush, and partly on the  need to avoid spreading too thinly the limited police and military resources at  its disposal.13 Th e small claim size had the consequence, however, of increas 
ing the numbers who had access to the lottery that constituted working on any  fi eld. Whether or not this was intended, the eff ect was to widen access to, and  more widely distribute the benefi ts of, the discoveries. 
Th e infamous miner’s license and fee imposed by the government also prob ably had mixed motives. Th e government needed additional revenue to po lice and to administer the goldfi elds, and to cope with the increased demands  on its resources resulting from the unexpected boom in the population of the  colony. Some form of tax on the booming sector was an obvious response. At

the same time, a fee to obtain a license to mine would in principle have had  some deterrent eff ect on the disruption in the colonial labor market caused  by the discoveries. It constituted a small barrier to entry into the industry (the  price of the lottery ticket, as it were), and, since it had to be paid every month,  an inducement to exit the industry if one’s income from mining was modest.  
13 In contrast to the situation in California in 1848, when gold was discovered in Victoria in  1851, there was a functioning government, including a legal framework for mining. Th e very  diff erent institutional context in California is described in Clay and Wright (2005, especially pp.  159– 71) and in the literature they cite.

Here is evidence of a government endeavoring to cope with increased demand  for its services (and not just those related to law and order), while also trying  to lessen the disruption to existing economic activities brought about by the  rush.14 
Whatever the intention, the license fee was considered unjust and consti tuted an important element in the story of the 1854 Eureka stockade “rebel lion” at Ballarat, west of Melbourne. An economic perspective on this episode  highlights other aspects. As a “tax,” it was levied as an entry fee to employment  in an industry— paid before any income could be earned in that industry. Th is  sort of arrangement is not unknown elsewhere in the economy (think of taxi  plates), but was unusual in that the probability of gain (profi t) from gold min ing was much more diffi cult to estimate at the time the up- front license fee had  to be paid than is the case in most occupations or business ventures. Especially  at the beginning of the rush, it was extremely diffi cult to predict, ex ante, the  distribution of returns among individual miners, and what would determine  that distribution. Again, contrast this with a lottery: the payout distribution is  known to all ticket buyers; and the probability of success by any individual is  known to be strictly random. Th e alternative ways to raise revenue from gold  mining might have included a production tax levied per fi ne ounce, and at the  point of fi rst sale on the fi elds to the gold commissioners, banks, or storekeep ers, but this would have been expensive to collect. Income taxes were even fur ther beyond the administrative machinery of the times. So the hated miner’s  license fee was replaced with a tax on the export of gold. Th e levy fell on suc cessful miners (and then only indirectly) rather than everyone at work on the  diggings. And it was imposed at an administratively convenient point in the  shipping of the product. One in- principle defi ciency of an export tax is the in centive to smuggle, and gold is perfect for this because it is nonperishable and  of high value relative to its bulk. But the incentive to smuggle is also a function  of the size of the tax, which was not especially high in this case. And Australia  had no land borders or close neighbors, which would have lowered the costs  of smuggling. Nonetheless, we will never know the extent to which returning  Chinese miners carried home their fi nds from the diggings, leading to some

understatement in recorded gold production at the time. 
Th e precise distribution of miners’ returns during the initial alluvial phase is,  of course, not known. Some indication of the average returns may be obtained  by dividing the value of gold produced by the estimated number of persons  employed in gold mining. Although the production estimates are likely to be  fairly accurate, the workforce engaged in mining was in constant fl ux, so that  estimates of the numbers of miners on the goldfi elds at the time of a census  may not refl ect the average over the year. Nonetheless, an “implicit” wage of the

average miner has been computed by this method. It shows a dramatic rise in  1852, then a decline, relative to alternative occupations, across the 1850s, con sistent with observed fl ows of labor to and from the diggings.15 But the average  return to mining tells us nothing about the distribution, knowledge of which  would enhance understanding of how widespread were the fi rst- round benefi ts  of the discoveries. Aft er all, the “rush” phenomenon is driven by the expecta tion of above- average gain.16 
As gold production evolved from its alluvial to a more capital- intensive  quartz mining phase there was a shift in the distribution of benefi ts.17 Th e small  group of diggers working together on a surface claim of small size gave way to  corporate ownership of enterprises and the employment of wage labor in deep  shaft mining covering a much larger claim. However, the wages paid to miners  had to match those paid elsewhere in what remained a high- wage economy;  and the shares in mining companies were publicly traded. 
Th ese relatively egalitarian distributional outcomes, achieved in a fairly be nign fashion, might have been very diff erent. In principle, access rights to each  goldfi eld could have been assigned by the governor or auctioned off to an in dividual or company, and the mining undertaken by wage labor, as happened  with some gold deposits in Latin America. Th e long- run consequences—  political, social, and economic— would have been very diff erent from what ac tually occurred. In practice, such an initial response was unlikely to have arisen  in the prevailing conditions. Under British law all gold discovered belonged to  the Crown. Th e alluvial nature of the initial discoveries made it hard to pre vent access to the fi elds, which, in any event, were scattered across a wide area  of almost unsettled territory.

Sustaining Economic Prosperity Following the Rushes 
One indicator of the long- term economic impact of the discoveries is the level  of gold output over the next four decades. Gold production averaged 3 million  fi ne ounces per annum in the 1850s. In the 1860s this declined, but only to about  2.5 million fi ne ounces. In the following two decades it fell further, to about 2  million and 1.5 million fi ne ounces in the 1870s and 1880s, respectively. Th at  is, more than thirty years aft er the initial gold rush, Australian production was  still at 50 percent of its peak level. Since (nominal) gold prices were essentially  stable, this trend in production closely corresponds to that in the (nominal)  value of gold produced. Th ere was no collapse of output following the initial  spike, but rather a very gradual decline over more than thirty years, followed  by a fresh round of major discoveries in Western Australia in the 1890s that  boosted production levels back to their 1850s level of 3 million fi ne ounces an nually. Th is contrasts with the experience of California. Th ere, peak production  in the 1850s was also about 3 million fi ne ounces annually. However it declined  much more rapidly than in Australia to less than a third of this by the early  1860s, aft er which it remained fairly constant.18 In this respect the two rushes  on opposite sides of the Pacifi c have diff ering long- run trajectories. However,  caution must be exercised in comparing these regions. From its initial location  primarily in Victoria, the gold industry spread over the following few decades  not just to New South Wales but also to Queensland, prior to the establishment  of the Western Australian goldfi elds in the 1890s. Likewise in California, the  discoveries at Sutter’s Mill marked just the fi rst of a succession of later fi nds  throughout not just that state but in what would later become Nevada and be yond, with San Francisco the center of a mining- based boom extending east

through the Sierras and north to British Columbia. 
So the benefi ts of the gold discoveries were long term rather than a fl ash in the  pan because of the sheer size of the gold deposits, revealed by the sequence of  subsequent discoveries and the continuing high levels of gold production. Th e  share of total employment in mining quickly fell from its gold- rush peak in the  1850s, but remained above 5 percent for the rest of the century— considerably  higher than the share recorded in the mining boom of recent years (fi gure 5.1).  Th e contribution of mining to GDP similarly fell away from its initial peak as  the booming economy quickly diversifi ed, but remained above 10 percent until

Th e sustained economic importance of gold may also be conveyed by its con tribution to exports. Wool dominated export receipts to 1850, but the value of  gold exports exceeded that of wool for the next twenty years. It is also impor tant to counter the impression sometimes conveyed by historical accounts that  gold was of importance in the economy only during the 1850s— oft en alluded  to as “the gold rush decade.” Th e rush phenomenon in its popularly conceived  and demographic form was indeed confi ned to this decade. But the same can not be said of activity levels in the gold industry, or of gold’s continuing major  contribution to the economy. In the 1870s, when wool fi nally regains its status

as the principal export commodity, gold accounts for over 28 percent of total  exports. Indeed, in the 1880s, at the height of the second pastoral boom, gold  exports were still worth 16 percent of all exports.20 By the end of the 1890s, with  the collapse of the wool industry on the one hand, and on the other the Western  Australian gold fi nds, gold exports were approximately equal in value to those  of wool, each at just over 30 percent of the total. 
19 Detailed estimates of the value of total mineral production are available from 1861. Gold  accounted for 89, 73, and 57 percent during the three decades beginning, respectively, 1861, 1871,  and 1881 (Butlin 1962, table 55, p. 115).

A second reason a “bust” did not occur following the initial gold boom is  that, as noted already, the immigrants who “rushed” in did not fl ow out. Some  left for other occupations as the gold industry became more capital intensive  with the decline of alluvial and rise of quartz mining, or left Victoria for other  colonies. But the proportion that left Australia was small. Two groups who did  were returning Chinese miners (though some stayed), and those attracted by  the gold discoveries in New Zealand— especially to the Otago fi elds in the early  1860s.21 
Why did they stay aft er the alluvial gold discoveries became smaller and less  frequent? Perhaps the most important reason is that the colonial governments,  and not just in Victoria, saw the long- run development potential from what  they guessed (or feared) might be a very short- run boom- bust episode. Th ere  was no “economic planning” as we might today observe in a less- developed  country, or “structural adjustment assistance” of the sort seen in a modern de 
veloped economy. But, looking back, it is remarkable the extent to which the  colonial governments acted as if they were engaged in a development strategy  to garner long- term benefi ts from what might well be a short- lived boom if  left to its own dynamic. Th ere are numerous illustrations of policy responses  consistent with this interpretation. Th e subsidization of young single female  immigrants was not novel, having been a feature of New South Wales policies  in the 1840s. But the economic benefi ts might include encouraging marriage  and permanent settlement among the young single males who had arrived dur ing the rush. Colonial government policies to increase the rate of agricultural  development by opening additional farming areas to settlement had a similar  motivation. And the advocacy by some that protective tariff s be introduced as  an incentive to employment creation in colonial manufacturing was couched  in the same terms— and, with some delay, implemented in Victoria. A further  expression of this developmental agenda is the Victorian government’s entry  into the London capital market in 1858. Th e British funds were to be used for  what we would now call public works or infrastructure spending— especially  on railways and urban utilities.

of the gold rushes was their demographic eff ect.22 Th e age distribution of the  population was impacted fi rst by the preponderance of young adults in the ini tial immigrant rush, then by the rise in the birth rate as they stayed and formed  new families. Th e fi rst- round economic consequences of this were to stimulate  the demand for housing and, indirectly, for a range of population- sensitive con struction. Th is was most evident in the expansion of urban areas— including  
21 Of course, the latter did not constitute a loss of population to the “Australasian” economy of  the time.

commercial buildings as well as transport and utilities infrastructure such as  roads, tramways, railways, ports, and water and gas networks.23 Th e rapid ex pansion of Melbourne, and especially its overtaking of Sydney as the largest  city, is the clearest illustration of the impact on the urban economy of the popu lation explosion accompanying the gold rushes. 
Th ere were also second- and later- round economic eff ects of the demo graphic shock of the 1850s. A generation later, the children of the gold- rush  generation formed their own households. Th e initial “kink” in the age distribu tion had an echo around twenty- fi ve years later. Th us the property boom of  the 1880s, most pronounced in Melbourne, was in part demand driven and  a lagged result of the earlier rushes. Th ese interactions between demographic  shocks and fl uctuations in the demand for particular types of investment ac tivity can be large enough to signifi cantly determine the course of aggregate  activity in the economy. And this was the case with the Victorian economy in  particular in the several decades that followed the gold rush. Th ere are multiple  reasons for the prosperity associated with the 1880s, as we will later see. But the  long- term impact of the gold rushes, operating over several decades through its  demographic eff ects, made an important contribution. 
Th ese long- run economic- demographic interactions aff ecting investment  and output levels in the economy are especially clearly illustrated in post– gold  rush Australia because of the relatively large size of the initial population shock.  But they are not unique to this period. Variations in the levels of immigration  have frequently imparted lesser shocks to the rate of population growth and/ 
or kinks to the age distribution. Sometimes these have economic origins. Th e  downturn in the economy aft er 1890 resulted in a long period of low or negative  immigration and slower population growth. And the depression of the 1930s  led to postponed marriages and a decline in the birth rate as well as reduced  immigration rates. War can also infl ict demographic shocks with long- run eco 
nomic consequences. Th e casualties of the two world wars were concentrated  in young adult males, and on these occasions there were also declines in rates  of marriage and immigration. In more recent Australian history the clearest as  well as the most familiar example of the phenomenon was the post- 1945 baby

boom. Its origins are very diff erent from that following the gold rushes. But  demographic shocks are central elements in the two longest economic booms  the country has experienced. 
Th e long- run economic benefi ts obtained from the exploitation of a nonre newable resource were also the result of the location of the midcentury gold dis coveries, most of which were made either in, or not far from, settled areas, even  if the settlement was new and consisted of low- density pastoral occupation.  Th e Victorian goldfi elds were also relatively close (about 150 kilometers) to the

ports and towns of Melbourne and Geelong, which, though less than twenty  years had passed since their foundation, had the potential to rapidly expand in  size. Further, areas of land between Melbourne and the goldfi elds were already  being settled by farmers producing cereals and dairy and horticultural prod 
ucts, while the land immediately surrounding the goldfi elds was suitable for  conversion from pastoral to more intensive agricultural pursuits in response  to the rapid increase in demand for food and fuel (hay and oats for horses).  Th ese geographic considerations determined the extent to which the demand  emanating from the gold rushes was lost to imports and the extent to which it  became a source of growth in domestic economic activity. 
At fi rst sight this is pure luck. Had gold been found in 1851 in, say, the Pil bara region of northwest Western Australia, where a century later vast reserves of  iron ore were discovered and mined, it seems highly improbable that the stimulus  to the Australian economy in either the short or long run would have been  anything approaching that resulting from the Victorian discoveries. Th ere was  little potential in the arid Pilbara for local production of food or other sup plies, hence all inputs required by the mining camps would have been shipped  long- distance. Th e tiny settlement on the Swan River (Perth) was the closest,  at over 1,500 kilometers, and would have received some stimulus. But imports  would surely have accounted for much more than they did in Victoria. Th at is,  much of the economic activity generated by a rush to the Pilbara in 1851 would  have been lost to the domestic economy. Further, there would have been no  employment opportunities in the Pilbara for ex- miners as the alluvial phase of  gold production declined, such as was aff orded by the expansion of Victorian  farming or the growth of manufacturing and service industries in Melbourne.  Hence a Pilbara rush in the 1850s would likely have been a transitory aff air, at  best bequeathing a modest- sized and isolated settlement to the region, just as  later mineral fi nds in the remote outback were to result in towns such as Mount  Isa in Queensland, Broken Hill in New South Wales, and Kalgoorlie in Western  Australia. 
However, perhaps this location issue is not simply a matter of luck. Gold  and other minerals were found in more remote areas of Australia— but later.

So it is likely that the timing of the 1851 discoveries was in part related to the  timing and pattern of exploration and initial pastoral occupation of southeast ern Australia.24 We will return to this theme in a later discussion about the  mid- twentieth- century mineral and energy discoveries, and will consider there  whether they can better be regarded as endogenous to economic activity, or  as truly exogenous and resulting from something random and appropriately  thought of as “luck” (chapter 7).

Any evaluation of the contribution of gold to Australian prosperity requires  an assessment of what would have happened in its absence. Th is is usually left  implicit in historians’ accounts of the period. However, constructing an explicit  counterfactual is made especially diffi cult in this instance because the economic  disturbance the discoveries unleashed was large relative to the size of the pre gold economy and pervasive in that few regions or industries were unaff ected.  But it is worth sketching a thought experiment on the topic. 
Th e massive population expansion beginning in 1852 would not have oc curred without gold. Instead, there would have been more modest growth via  much lower levels of immigration. Some of the positive economic eff ects of  the discovery of gold to which we have referred constituted simply an accel eration of what would have occurred without gold, but been longer in coming;  others may never have occurred. An example of the former is the timing of  the Victorian government loan raisings in the London market. An example  of the latter is the overtaking of Sydney by Melbourne as the largest city (until  the end of the nineteenth century) and dominant fi nancial center of Australia  (until the end of the twentieth century). Rural development, the spread of  settlement, and expansion of farm exports would have underpinned growth  in a no- gold world, as they had prior to the gold discoveries, and to which  they contributed thereaft er. Th e growth of those rural industries not primar ily oriented to export markets at that time, such as dairying and horticulture,  would have been slower, and this eff ect may have been especially pronounced  in Victoria. Perhaps the expanding wheat industry would have contributed  more to exports in a no- gold Australia with its smaller population. However,  since the location of rural production is largely determined by climatic and  soil conditions as well as transport costs, in the long run it is likely the same  mix of farming activities would have arisen, and with the same regional pat tern of specialization. 
With a slower expansion of population, of urbanization, and of rural devel opment, the aggregate economy would have been smaller than it was— perhaps  at any subsequent date. It is trickier to guess at the counterfactual income per  capita. We have observed that the re- equilibration of the economy aft er the

positive shock of the discoveries left GDP per person above what it had been  in 1850 although below its peak. But it does not follow that per capita incomes  may not also have risen in the smaller and less populous no- gold economy  between, say, 1850 and 1860. Th is requires a more thorough modeling exer 
cise than has been so far done, or can be done here. Th e safer conclusion is  that, in addition to delivering a permanently larger population and economy,  the discovery of gold was associated with a sustained rise in Australia’s already  relatively high incomes. Measured in terms of this key indicator of economic  prosperity, the gold rush was neither a fl ash in the pan nor an example of the  so- called resource curse.

Consolidating Democracy and Resolving the  
Squatter- Selector Conflict 
Th e draft ing of the colonial constitutions in the early 1850s occurred against  the background of the economic bonanza and population disruption associ ated with the gold rushes, and historians have debated the relationship between  the two. One point of agreement is that the discovery of gold accelerated the  political reform already under way: “Responsible government might not have  been established when it was, if it had not been for the great strengthening of  the middle class brought about by the gold discoveries. Moreover, without this  middle order of liberal- minded but respectable townspeople, self- governing in 
stitutions would probably not have functioned as smoothly as they did.”25 In the  context of the narrative in the previous chapter, the goal of the landed interests  to maintain as much of their political power as possible in the writing of the  colonies’ constitutions, and hence through the design of the new colonial par 
liaments, was made more diffi cult.26 
In the battle to enshrine democratic forms in the new political institutions in  the Australian colonies, one major issue was the composition and power of the  upper houses of the new legislatures. And it was in the upper houses that the  squatter interest retained greater infl uence. A key point of contention was thus  whether membership in these would be by nomination or election. Th e former  mode was adopted in New South Wales and Queensland. A second issue was  the breadth of the franchise for these upper houses, especially the extent to  which the property qualifi cation would be more restrictive than for the lower  houses. Other issues critical to the progress of democratic reform concerned  the power of the upper houses to block appropriation bills or reject other leg islation originating in the lower houses (where the government was formed),  and the extent of the discretionary powers of the colonial governor in times of  political deadlock between the two houses. Colonial politics for several decades  was complex, messy, and fl uid, with recurring serious tensions over these fun damental issues. But the squatter infl uence in the upper houses, though able to  frustrate and delay, was never suffi cient to permanently block the will of the ma

jority in the more representative lower house. Perhaps the touchstone issue  here concerned land policies that aimed to subdivide and redistribute the pas toral leases of the squatters to would- be farmers during the 1860s and 1870s. 
Th is is important in our search for the bases of Australian prosperity because  the assignment of property rights in rural land must be conducive to landown
