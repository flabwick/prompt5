ers maximizing output and productivity. It is also important because the dis tribution of ownership of one of the major sources of wealth in the nineteenth  century was at issue, and we have previously noted the relationship in the long run  between wealth inequality and prosperity. It remained uncertain whether rural  Australia faced a Jeff ersonian or an Argentine future, despite the victories for  the former outcome in the 1847 regulations and in the constitutional changes  of the 1850s. 
In Victoria in the late 1850s and early 1860s, there was both unemployment  and out- migration to the newly discovered goldfi elds in New Zealand, hence  the colonial government was anxious that population gains be retained, and  making land available to more would- be farmers seemed the principal way to  achieve this. Most likely the gold rush only brought forward a demand to “un 
lock” (the term used at the time) the pastoral leases that would have arisen any way with the continued but very much slower immigration of free settlers, the  rise in urban demand for agricultural products, and the growth in knowledge  of the agricultural potential of land currently used solely for grazing sheep. Th is  conjecture is supported by the fact that agitation to unlock these lands was not  confi ned to Victoria.27 
Th is second stage of the disposal of Australia’s public lands looks somewhat  like that which occurred in the United States under the Homestead Act of  1862, and close attention was paid to contemporary developments there. Th e  aim was to create large numbers of medium- sized family farms for “selection”  from Crown land currently on pastoral lease; hence the episode is known as  the “squatter- selector” confl ict. Here the economic interests are reasonably well  defi ned, with the resolution of the confl ict occurring within the institutional  framework created by the granting of responsible government. However the  combination of fi nding gold and the constitutional concessions by Britain had  signifi cantly reduced both the economic and political power of the squatters  compared to their position immediately aft er the 1847 regulations. 
Under the selection acts in the colonies, millions of acres of land were sold.  Typical selection sizes were 320 or 640 acres, with survey before selection  (other than in New South Wales), and a complex and changing set of auction

or conditional grant mechanisms used for the allocation to would- be farmers.  For contemporaries and historians alike the major issue has been the degree to  which the original intention of the framers of the legislation was undermined—  that is, the extent to which the squatters were able to preserve the best land  for themselves and their families through corrupting the selection process.  Th e consensus is that the squatters sabotaged the aims of the legislation and  retained considerable landed wealth, an assessment that appears to support  the conjectural history sketched in the previous chapter, and suggests that this

squatter “victory” was a decisive outcome of critical importance to Australia’s  development.28 
However, wool growing in semi- arid areas is subject to scale economies, and  hence requires large land holdings. Also, both contemporary critics and most  historians have judged the selection acts in terms of how much crop production  expanded— in contrast to sheep numbers or wool production— employing this  as an indicator of the desired “agricultural” (rather than “pastoral”) develop 
ment that selection was designed to promote. But the Australian climate and  soils are such that even today the area cultivated remains small compared to the  area of grazing land. Th e relevant information about soils and climate was not  available at the time. Confusion about the economics of pioneer agriculture,  as well as powerful ideological impulses, lay behind the campaign to break up  the squatters’ runs. Assessment of the agricultural as distinct from the pastoral  potential of much of southeastern Australia was way too optimistic, driven by  the development aims and revenue needs of the colonial governments, as well  as a mistaken belief that much of the squatters’ land could be turned into viable  small family farms based on cropping.29 
From a long- run development perspective, the squatters did not emerge vic torious. Th e selection acts prevented those squatters who occupied good land  from keeping all of it. In areas where small- scale agriculture was viable, they  had to make way for the selectors, even if they oft en corruptly gained owner ship of more of this land than was intended.30 In the semi- arid zones, attempts  to replace large grazing properties with small- scale crop farming failed spectac ularly, and farm amalgamation or abandonment and reversion to wool produc tion followed.31 In the arid zone farther inland, only large- scale pastoral hold ings were profi table. Th e chaotic selection process vastly increased knowledge  about land use in Australia, however costly the acquisition of this information  proved to be for the failed selectors. Th e squatters’ economic position within  the rural sector was diminished, but they survived wherever the most effi cient  use of land was large- scale pastoral farming.

28 Historians also concur that the selection process was most corrupted by the squatters in New  South Wales and least in South Australia.

dairy products, horticulture) all reduced the relative importance of pastoral  production in the economy. A fi nal phase of pastoral expansion into marginal  inland areas in the 1880s was followed by fi nancial collapse and drought in  the 1890s. Further, the rise of mixed (wheat/sheep) farming, and the growth of  the meat export trade following the introduction of refrigerated shipping in the  1880s, blurred the distinction between squatters and farmers. 
Accordingly, in the analysis presented here, the squatter- selector confl ict is  not the potential turning point the historians make it out to be. Sequence mat ters. If the squatters had been granted freehold title in 1847, the outcome of the  legislative fi ght over selection and closer settlement aft er 1860 would have been  less certain. Th e squatters could, and did, fi ght to retain their privileged access  to the land. And the historians’ consensus about the squatters’ ability to re tain considerable chunks of good agricultural land in some areas where smaller  farms might have been viable is correct. But it was a rearguard action. With  the passage of the selection acts, the landed elite lost their ability to protect, by  means of their dominance of the new colonial parliaments, the economic insti tution (large pastoral holdings on long- term leases from the Crown) on which  their wealth was based. Hence they attempted to maintain their economic pos ition by undermining the selection process in practice. 
From this perspective, the squatter- selector confl ict of the 1860s is better  seen as a major challenge to, or test of, the political institutions created in the  1850s, but not so critical a challenge that these democratic institutions were  themselves under threat. Separate and more detailed examination is required to  determine whether specifi c aspects of the colonies’ constitutions and electoral  rules were infl uential in limiting corruption during the process of land selec 
tion, or exacerbated the problem of rent capture by the squatters and hence  slowed economic growth. Nonetheless, the partial and messy re- allocation of  considerable areas of Australian farmland occurred without bloodshed or revo lution. Th e new political institutions provided the context for peacefully resolv ing what under other conditions might have provoked serious confl ict, hence  turning the country along an altogether diff erent path of development.

Australian land policies are in substantial contrast to those of Argentina.  For many years the British government did not surrender ownership of Aus tralian land and, before independence, the Iberian monarchies followed a  similar policy in their American domains.

When cereals became an important  Australian export, family- operated, medium- size farms were relatively more  important than in Argentina, where tenant farming under contracts of about  fi ve years were more common than in Australia. A system of rural produc tion, where tenant farmers moved frequently from one region to another, did  not seem to damage Argentina’s rural productivity and output growth before  1929, but it had deleterious eff ects on income distribution as well as on social  and political life.32 
And the marked divergence in economic performance in these two other wise comparable settler economies aft er 1929 has been attributed to precisely  these distributional, institutional, and political diff erences.33 
Openness and Growth 
As the contribution of the gold- mining sector to the domestic economy gradually  declined, the rural sector resumed its leading role as an engine of growth, contrib uting both to the expansion of the economy and to increased prosperity. Before I  assess the contribution of the rural industries, however, it is important to recognize  how critical the favorable conditions prevailing in the international economy were  to Australia’s natural resource- based expansion and prosperity at this time. 
International trade expanded rapidly during these decades, was centered in  northwestern Europe (especially Britain), and refl ected a simple geographic  pattern of specialization. Th e industrializing “core” exploited its comparative  advantage in the production of manufactured goods, which it exported to the  non- industrialized “periphery” whose comparative advantage lay in natural 
resource- intensive foodstuff s and raw materials. Th ese were, in turn, exported  back to the core economies. Th e Britain- Australia trading relationship closely  fi ts this wider pattern.

However, a more sophisticated  analysis is required to determine the direction of causality, a topic to which we  will return. What is unmistakable is that the economy was more “open” in these  decades than it would be for much of the twentieth century— that is, the export  and trade ratios were at a higher level. 
Much of Australia’s economic development during these decades has been  attributed to its ability to effi ciently produce and competitively sell the products  of its rural sector on world markets. As we have seen, the export of wool began  in the 1820s, and by the 1850s, Australia was supplying over half the market  for this key input into the British manufacturing sector. And wool dominates  rural exports during these decades through 1890, though agricultural products

begin to make a signifi cant contribution especially toward the end of the cen tury: fi rst wheat, then following the introduction of refrigerated shipping in the  1880s, also dairy products and frozen meat. Th is literature views the expan sion and diversifi cation of rural production for export as the principal driver  of extensive growth; and also views the effi ciency levels reached by Australian  farmers as a principal source not only of their export competitiveness but also  the prosperity of the wider community. Th is “export- led” growth perspective is  similar to that adopted in studies of the role of international trade in account ing for the rapid growth of some East Asian economies in the second half of the  twentieth century. 
Th e nineteenth- century variant of this explanation for growth has focused  primarily on the linkages that connected the export product (sometimes called  the “staple”) to the economy of the region in which it was produced, and thus  to the wider economy. Th is approach is helpful in highlighting the varying im 
pacts on the domestic economy that resulted from diff erent staple products  such as gold, wool, or wheat. We have touched on this in earlier discussion.  Wool was profi tably exported halfway round the world from the 1820s because  sheep were self- reproducing, were grazed on (almost free) natural grassland,  and required few purchased inputs beyond some labor for shepherding and  shearing. A consequence is that there was no need for input supply fi rms to  locate near to the production point: pastoralists could spread far from cit 
ies or towns. Th is was feasible also because wool is nonperishable and had a  high value- to- bulk ratio. Wool was brilliantly suitable as a staple product with  which to open up large swathes of the outback. Similarly, we have previously  described how special features of gold enabled its profi table production under  frontier conditions. Again, properties of the product surmounted the transport  costs of getting gold from the mines, given the poor state of colonial roads,  and of shipping it to London. Wool and gold thus share attributes that account  for their ability to underpin Australia’s early growth at a time when its frontier  economy was very small and possessed little infrastructure. 
In the staple view of Australian growth, wheat production is contrasted with  wool for its diff erent linkage eff ects. Th e production technology was more capi

tal intensive, especially in the widespread use of labor- saving machinery. In  this particular rural industry, labor productivity was high because of mecha nization rather than land intensity. Indeed, given appropriate soil and climatic  conditions, the farm- fi rm could be much smaller than a pastoral station. But  mechanized wheat growing required local supply and repair services, so was  associated with a denser pattern of rural towns. Also, wheat had a lower value to- bulk ratio than either gold or wool, so could not be transported far without  railways to reduce transport costs. Hence the wheat frontier never extended  more than a short distance beyond a coastal port or the rail network. Wheat  growing thus stimulated the extension of rural railways.

Th is focus in the staple interpretation of growth on specifi c characteristics of  the product extends to the stimulus aff orded the rest of the domestic economy  as a result of off - farm processing. Gold was exported essentially unprocessed.  Wool was also subject to little downstream processing. We have noted in our  discussion of the 1840s how wool washing raised its value, a simple illustration  of adding value prior to export. Th e gradual emergence of textile and clothing  manufacturing in Australia absorbed some of the wool- grower’s output. But  most wool was processed in textile mills in Britain before being transformed  there into clothing, blankets, and other woolen products. 
Th e wheat industry was a little diff erent from wool in terms of its down stream processing within Australia.34 For one thing, a higher proportion was  consumed domestically: Australia only became a consistent net wheat exporter  at the end of the nineteenth century. In addition, the transport of wheat re quired not just railway infrastructure but also storage facilities (grain silos or  elevators) along the rail network. Th e fl our mills that processed the wheat may  not have been especially high tech, even for the nineteenth century, but they  provide an illustration of the expansion of the rural sector stimulating domestic  processing of farm products. From the 1880s the dairy export industry and the  frozen meat industry provide additional examples. It is appropriate to regard  both dairy factories and meat- freezing works as “manufacturing” establish ments, and the refrigerated butter, cheese, lamb, and mutton produced in and  exported from them as “simply transformed” manufactured goods. 
Th e expansion of the wheat industry also stimulated domestic production of  manufactured inputs to an extent not seen with either wool or gold production.  Perhaps the most visible, as well as the most sophisticated, was the local agri cultural machinery industry. Growing out of local blacksmith repair shops, and  the activities of individual inventors, agricultural implement fi rms fl ourished  in the second half of the nineteenth century. Australian manufacturers suc cessfully competed against imported British and American farm equipment,  and prior to the First World War had even established export outlets for har vesting machinery.35 Th ese products of the agricultural engineering industry  surely qualify as “elaborately transformed” manufactures for that era. Indeed,

the selection of the McKay Harvester factory in Melbourne as the basis for the  famous “Harvester” judgment on wages and margins in 1907 by Justice Higgins  was due to its having one of the largest and most diverse skilled labor forces in  a single industrial establishment at that time.

private sectors, and the growth of nonrural industries such as transport, manu facturing, and services. Some historians have gone so far as to elevate the staple  model to the status of a general explanation for the growth of the Australian econ omy at this time.36 Th is emulated research by Canadian historians who had earlier  developed the staple perspective to explain the growth of their economy. Indeed,  Boris Schedvin has argued that the diff erent mix of staple products in nineteenth century Australia (wool and gold) compared to Canada (timber products and  wheat) accounts for the earlier and more rapid development of manufacturing  in the latter, and that this in turn explains what he alleges to be Australia’s poorer  growth performance during the twentieth century than Canada’s.37 
Th e staple approach thus captures important elements of the relationship be tween international trade and growth in an economy endowed with abundant  natural resources. But it does not constitute a “theory” of growth in any formal  sense, for it does not endogenously explain how one dominant staple follows  another, thus sustaining growth, or how economies founded on staple exports  experience a transition to growth based on other sources. More rigorous analy sis of the trade- growth nexus across countries, and for recent decades, has met  with mixed results. Even the direction of causation is not as clear- cut as im plied by export- led growth models, whether of the staple or some other variety.  Further discussion of this is deferred to a later chapter. However, in explaining  Australian growth in the late nineteenth century, the historians’ focus on the  importance of the expansion of the rural sector, and on the vital, related role of  export demand, seems fully justifi ed. 
Of course international trade does not occur in isolation. A richer approach  is to begin with an appreciation of the depth and breadth of Australia’s integra tion into the international economy. Th e trade fl ows highlighted so far were  accompanied by factor fl ows. Financial capital and immigrants moved from  labor- and capital- abundant Britain to labor- and capital- scarce Australia in  response to the higher returns to both factors in the latter. It is crucial to any  understanding of Australia’s economy at this time to recognize that these trade  and factor fl ows were interdependent. Furthermore, it cannot be overlooked  that this high degree of economic integration between Britain and Australia

infrastructure development such as railway construction. Th e economic ben efi ts extended also to their membership in a type of currency union, since ster ling was the international reserve currency of the era. And their defense and  security arrangements were funded primarily by the imperial government—  that is, by the British taxpayer. I will defer a fuller accounting of the costs and  benefi ts to the Australian economy of the imperial connection to chapter 7. Th e  aim here is to broaden consideration of the role of international economic links  beyond trade to factor movements. 
Th e infl ows of foreign (mainly British) investment in this period were pro digious. One measure is the proportion of domestic investment funded not by  domestic savings but by those of foreigners. Th is averaged 35 percent between  1861 and 1889 and was higher than this during the 1880s.38 Th us extensive  growth during this long boom was critically dependent (in a proximate sense)  on the importation of British capital. Since most was borrowed by the colonial  governments, this added to their debt, which during these decades was grow ing faster than GDP (fi gure 5.3). Th e prosperity of the period covered by this  chapter is thus supported in part by a fairly steady run- up in the level of public  indebtedness from an initial position of no debt at the granting of responsible  government. By the mid- 1880s, government debt exceeded 60 percent of GDP,  a level that, then as now, might be regarded as increasingly exposing public  fi nances— and hence prosperity— to a crisis triggered by, for example, a down turn in economic activity, higher costs of rolling over existing loans, or a clos ing up of capital markets. 
It is pertinent to observe this relationship from the other side: Australia was  a major destination for British overseas investment during these decades. Since  Britain accounted for a large share of all international capital fl ows before 1914,  it follows that Australia fi gured prominently on a world scale as a recipient of  the surplus savings of others, especially prior to 1890. Here is one indicator of  Australia’s importance within the world economy during this fi rst era of glo 
balization. Nothing comparable was to be attained during the second period  of globalization in the late twentieth century with respect to Australia’s signifi - cance as a destination for international capital fl ows.

Th e contribution of immigration to the expansion of the population between  1861 and 1889 was about 34 percent, and higher than it was to be again on a sus tained basis until aft er 1945.39 Again, we can look at this from an international  perspective. Within the wider context of the mass migrations of the times, the  Australian share of the (approximately) fi ft y million European emigrants be fore the First World War was much lower than that of the United States, but

Th ese numbers suggest that extensive growth was signifi cantly boosted dur ing the long boom by these sizable factor infl ows. However they do not indicate  whether the eff ect on per capita income of this augmentation of domestic with  foreign supplies of labor and capital was favorable or unfavorable. In the absence  of evidence one can only cautiously speculate. To illustrate, it is possible that  the immigrant workers on average possessed about the same level of human  capital (formal education, skills, experience) as existing members of the Austra lian labor force. It could also be the case that the foreign- fi nanced additions to the  capital stock were such as to leave the capital per worker approximately the same  Copyright © 2012.

as before. Th e population, workforce, capital stock, and total economy would all  be larger as a result of the factor infl ows, but labor productivity (and, other things  equal, per capita income) would be unchanged. It follows that if the high levels of  immigration and foreign investment into Australia during this long boom are to  have played a role in its high and rising levels of prosperity, we have to search for  evidence other than the mere size of the infl ows. 
One possibility is that the human capital of immigrants was above that of the  native born. Britain was the dominant source of immigrants, and one study of  their occupation mix indicates that the associated skill levels were on average  below those of British migrants arriving aft er the Second World War.

ever, what is required is a comparison of the skills of immigrants with those  of the existing workforce, but matching occupational data are not available for  this period.41 Another contribution of immigration to productivity and hence  income at this time may also have been the immigrants’ higher workforce par 
ticipation rate than the resident population’s; though speculative, this would  result from the immigrants’ higher masculinity ratio and higher working-age  proportion, a topic we return to in the next chapter. A related benefi t of high  levels of immigration is a more fl exible domestic labor market—immigrants are  likely to settle where labor is in greatest demand. 
A second possibility is that foreign capital fi nanced imports of machinery  and equipment that embodied technology closer to global best practice than  what was (or could have been) produced from domestic sources. Britain was the  technological leader at the time, and this is where most of Australia’s imported  capital equipment was obtained. Th is transmission mechanism enhanced Aus 
tralian access to products and production methods that would have a favorable  impact on productivity as well as on the level of output. 
Another source of productivity gain from these factor infl ows arose insofar  as there were scale economies that would not have been realized had Australia  relied just on natural increase in the population for additions to its workforce,  and on domestic saving alone to fi nance investment. More precisely, any such  gains, assessed in a given year, would simply have been delayed until the autar 
kic (counterfactual) economy eventually reached the same size. Th ese econo mies of scale might have arisen at the level of the fi rm or industry, or have been  economy- wide. Given the initially very small size of the Australian population  and economy, it is hard to think that there were not some unexploited econo mies of this type. A closely related but distinct source of potential productiv ity improvement arises from agglomeration economies— and these are most  prevalent in large urban areas. Th e fact that a relatively high proportion of the  Australian population lived in a small number of cities possibly helped capture  any agglomeration eff ects, off setting to some extent the disadvantages of its  small and widely scattered total population.

during this period and the openness of the Australian economy. But this takes  us only so far in the search for an explanation of Australia’s especially high  incomes at this time. Th e expansion of the economy and population between  1851 and 1890 could have occurred with no rise in per capita income, and  thus with some deterioration in Australian income levels relative to bench 
mark economies such as Britain, Canada, or the United States. So, why was this  period of sustained and rapid extensive growth also one that delivered such  world- leading levels of income? To address this question, it is fi rst necessary to  drill down further into the sources of effi ciency in the farm sector during this

golden age, and then turn in the next chapter to the comparative evidence of  economy- wide productivity and income levels. 
Rural Productivity and Its Sources 
I have previously argued (in chapter 4) that Australian woolgrowers must have  achieved production effi ciency levels the equal of or superior to those achieved  anywhere else. When discussing the period 1820– 50, several likely sources of  this productivity superiority were identifi ed, such as that land costs were low  (almost free to “squatters”); that sheep grazed on natural grassland rather than  sown grasses, stubble, hay, or root crops requiring repeated cultivation; that  pastoral properties were largely unfenced, with boundary riders and shepherds  serving as cheaper substitutes; that there was limited investment undertaken in  fi xed capital (dams, windmills, stockyards, but few farm buildings); that mild  winters meant there was no need to keep stock indoors; and that, outside the  annual mustering and shearing season, labor requirements were much lower  than in European farming. Th ese sources of effi ciency are, conceptually, dis tinct from the scale economies that were reaped especially in the semi- arid out 
back regions where very large fl ocks were grazed at very low stocking rates per  hectare. In addition, the Australian woolgrowers early developed an extremely  effi cient system of fi nancing and marketing the wool clip through “stock and  station” fi rms and their agent system. All this underpinned pastoral productiv 
ity levels during the fi rst pastoral age, prior to the discovery of gold. 
Th e further productivity- enhancing changes occurring within the pastoral  zone between 1850 and 1890 were not especially dramatic. On inland pastoral  stations where wool was the dominant if not sole product, there was further  investment in stockyards, shearing sheds, and especially in securing reliable  sources of water for the sheep— oft en the key determinant of the ability to grow  wool in the semi- arid regions. Th ere were some mechanical innovations of  importance— notably the replacement of hand shears with shearing machines,  and improvements in the wool press. Th ere was an ongoing search for superior

breeds of sheep aimed at raising fl eece weight or quality. And perhaps most  important, there were improvements in station management. Th ese pastoral  properties were sometimes quite large enterprises in terms of the value of the  fl ock and the annual wool clip, but not in terms of their permanent workforce,  which was typically small. Shearing had the seasonal peak labor requirement,  but was undertaken primarily by itinerant contractors. 
Although there was a further phase of spreading pastoral occupation into  inland areas between 1850 and 1890, this period also saw the conversion of  earlier- occupied areas closer to the coasts from wool- growing to grain farming  or to mixed wheat growing/sheep raising. Th e rise in mixed farming in some  regions refl ected its increased profi tability; consequently, it likely increased  farm productivity. Th e relative importance of nonwool rural activities began

to increase also in response to the rapid increase in population and its food re quirements, stimulating especially dairying and horticulture. Furthermore we  have to recall the importance of grains and straw as the energy source for the  predominantly horse- based transport systems of that era. Again, the domestic  demand for this nineteenth- century equivalent to oil grew with the population.  Th us there was some change in the product mix of the rural sector.42 
Beyond the wool industry, the period aft er 1850 saw many changes in rural  technology and management, some quite dramatic. One source of enhanced ef fi ciency was the introduction of wire fencing, facilitating the selective breeding  of sheep for particular wool or meat characteristics relative to what is possible  in open- range farming. Fencing also permitted “mixed” farming by keeping  sheep separate from crops, and a property subdivided into fenced paddocks is  a prerequisite for rotation cropping alongside livestock production. Th ese may  be thought of as yielding scope economies in the farm- fi rm. 
Another source of productivity growth in nonpastoral farming across these  decades was the diff usion of mechanized production methods and constant im provements to the implements and machines already in use. Th ese include cul tivation, planting, harvesting and post- harvesting equipment, and the cream  separator. Th e “stump- jump” plow and the “stripper” harvesting machine have  legendary status as local inventions assisting the spread of agriculture into areas  where imported implements and machines were less suited. Th e imports came  primarily from Britain and the United States, with the latter’s agricultural ma chinery industry witnessing rapid innovation in the late nineteenth century.  Th us not only did the amount of machinery per worker in agriculture rise, but  the technology embodied in the equipment was at the world frontier. Both con tributed to increasing labor productivity.43 
Agricultural mechanization was not just a response to labor scarcity and its  relatively high price, but had other productivity- enhancing or cost- reducing  benefi ts. It raised yields by better spacing seeds during planting, compared with  traditional methods of broadcast hand sowing. Cultivation implements assisted  weed control. Th e speed of some farm operations was increased, hence more  work could be undertaken under optimal conditions for planting and harvest

ing. And the quality of the product was better controlled with mechanized pro duction methods. 
Th e adoption of new machines and implements was a highly visible source  of increased rural productivity at this time. But there were other important  sources. Th is was the era of the development and adoption of new varieties of  wheat— most famously those associated with the work of William Farrer. Th e  location- specifi c features of soils and climate meant that imported European  crop varieties did not always fl ourish, or were not suitable in all regions. Patient  experimentation over many years by innovative farmers and colonial government

agencies was required to identify or develop the best varieties to deal with crop  disease (such as rust in wheat), poor quality soils, drought, and high summer  temperatures. In part the new varieties simply permitted crops to be grown in  areas where they otherwise would not have been planted at all; and in part they  increased yields on land already cropped.44 
Closely related to the mechanical and biological innovations in agriculture  at this time were changes in farm management and organization. First, note  should be made of the eff ect on average farm size of the selection acts. In many  instances they prescribed maximum farm sizes that were either too small to  be effi cient from the outset, or, especially with the increased fi xed costs associ 
ated with mechanization, were soon found to be below the acreage needed for  profi table production. So, despite the wishes of the legislators, powerful market  forces led farmers to seek scale economies through farm amalgamation. From  about 1890 the long decline in the average size of rural holdings ended, and av 
erage farm sizes began to increase. It may be conjectured that the selection acts  at fi rst lowered rural productivity; that their circumvention had the benefi t of  minimizing this politically imposed ineffi ciency and drag on growth; and that  the subsequent rise in farm size was a source of productivity gain. 
Other on- farm changes also had productivity- enhancing eff ects, even if in troduced to reduce risk and lessen the volatility in farm income, such as that re sulting from drought. Th e rise of mixed farming diversifi ed the farmers’ sources  of income and increased the viability of the enterprise in an environment where  both climate and commodity prices fl uctuated markedly across the seasons.  Rotation cropping, fallowing, and the use of artifi cial fertilizers were designed  to raise yields, but in most cases would also have raised labor productivity. 
Th ese mechanical, biological, and managerial innovations in farming had di verse origins. Much consisted of “folk science,” or the contributions of talented  pioneer farmers who over time accumulated knowledge about how to improve  profi tability or output. Th is knowledge then spread through local information  networks, such as rural newspapers and annual “shows.” But where the new sci entifi c knowledge or technology originated overseas, or required professional  skills, more formal mechanisms predominated. With respect to mechanical

innovations, the private sector could profi tably supply the new technology to  the farmer as it was “embodied” in the new machine or implement, and the  property rights of the inventor (typically, an agricultural machinery fi rm) were  protected by patent. Australian farm- implement- and machinery- makers com 
peted vigorously with the imported products of British and American fi rms.  With respect to biological and especially managerial innovations, the private  sector was much less able to meet the farmers’ requirements. Th ere are strong

public goods characteristics to the production of this type of knowledge. Th us  it is no surprise that, whereas there was no demand from farmers that the co lonial governments establish state plow or harvester factories, there was a de mand that they establish experimental farms, botanical gardens, agricultural  high schools and colleges, and departments of agriculture.45 
Th ere has been limited assessment of the contribution of productivity im provement to the expansion of rural output at this time, and of the possible  sources of the productivity gains whether these are measured as labor produc tivity or multifactor productivity. Th e most detailed analysis relates to Victo ria, which has the most comprehensive statistics on the rural sector during the  period. Th ere the mix of farming diff ered markedly from that of Australia as  a whole, with pastoral production constituting a smaller (and declining) share  of rural output, and crop production and dairying correspondingly larger (and  increasing) shares. Hence the Victorian evidence on rural productivity may not  be representative of the whole country. Quite low rates of growth in labor pro ductivity are recorded there between 1870 and the 1890s followed by a marked  acceleration. Th e likely sources of this effi ciency improvement on Victorian  farms lie in the cumulative but lagged eff ects of the diverse changes noted above  in farm management, product mix, scale economies, and mechanization, which  all began prior to 1890, but were accelerated from the mid- 1890s.46 
More important to our search for the sources of Australian prosperity is the  evidence from a recent attempt to compare the levels of labor productivity in  the agricultural sectors of Australia and the United Kingdom from 1861.47 It  appears that, in striking contrast to the contemporary assessments of “slovenly  farming” practices frequently expressed in reference to Australia’s farmers,  where English practice appears to have been the benchmark, colonial farmers  were the more effi cient producers— and by a considerable margin. In 1861, labor  productivity in Australian agriculture was 76 percent above that in the United  Kingdom, and this sizable superiority increased markedly over the subsequent  three decades to reach 252 percent in 1891. Looking beyond the period covered  in this chapter, the 1901 estimate of 71 percent refl ects the negative impact  of the serious drought that aff ected rural Australia at the time, but by 1911,

the large lead had been restored with a 189 percent higher productivity level  than in U.K. agriculture. It is possible to extend this comparison to include  Canada and the United States, albeit indirectly. Th e level of labor productivity  in U.S. agriculture was close to that for the United Kingdom during these de 
cades, moving within a narrow range from 92 to 112 percent between 1851 and  1911.48 A separate study reports that labor productivity in Canadian agriculture

was below that in the United States between 1871 and 1921, ranging from 65  to 87 percent of the American levels.49 It follows that Australian farmers’ ef fi ciency levels were signifi cantly higher than all three: indeed, “this suggests  that Australia was the world’s agricultural productivity leader at this time.”50  Comparative analysis thus powerfully reinforces the importance of the skills  and enterprise of their farmers to the prosperity that all Australians enjoyed.

How do we sum up the story of post– gold rush economic prosperity? One his tory of the economy covering this period has the catchy title No Paradise for Workers.51 Undoubtedly the average standard of living of Australians in the  years prior to 1890 was below what is enjoyed today when, perhaps, we are at  least closer to whatever constitutes the economic paradise the authors had in  mind. But since long- run trend growth has been positive, comparisons of cur rent with earlier prosperity will always indicate the past falls short. So this is a  benchmark with limited relevance. Th e more conventional benchmark of pros perity in a given period is whether changes in an indicator such as income per  capita are positive, and if so how rapidly it rises. Certainly the period from 1850  to 1890 saw an increase in this key measure. Th ough there seems no simple  explanation, let alone a single cause, neither is there any deep mystery concern ing the likely factors at work. Part of the story is the state of the international  economy, which was particularly conducive to the rapid growth of the settler  societies located in temperate zones, especially their export- oriented produc ers of foodstuff s and other raw materials. And the Australian producers were  highly effi cient, employed best- practice technology, and were innovative and  adaptable in a high- risk frontier environment. A further aspect of the story lies  in the sheer abundance of the natural- resource base of land and minerals that  was being discovered and exploited at this stage. Finally, something did not  happen that might have changed the outcome of this story. Australians did not  seriously squander the growth potential inherent in the resource endowment—  though, as further discussed in the next chapter, neither were their conservation

and environmental- management practices especially laudatory, at least by the  standards of the early twenty- fi rst century. In short, Australians were prime  benefi ciaries of this fi rst era of globalization, becoming very rich on the basis  of the interactions existing between their natural- resource endowment, the ef 
fi ciency with which this was utilized, the quality of their institutional arrange ments, and their choice of an outward- oriented growth strategy.
