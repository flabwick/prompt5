The Colonial Period, 1870–1901 
The withdrawal of the main body of British troops from the Australian colonies in August 1870 caused no great perturbation. Some newspaper editorials praised the opportunity the change had created for serious thinking about the defence of the colonies, but the second Intercolonial Conference in Melbourne in July – after reminding the British government of its duty to provide for their maritime defence needs – returned to its usual round of squabbling over free trade, tariffs and a customs union.

least, the period until Federation in 1901 was to prove a disappointment. The last thirty years of the 19th century saw a period of enormous pros perity up to 1888, followed by a devastating bust in the Australian colonies. The 1870s and, even more, the 1880s were a time of great expansion in the economy marked by the inflow of British capital and its utilisation in land booms and speculation. Sophisticated communications networks and consid erable building activity refashioned the major cities, especially Melbourne, which became the financial capital of the country and a great Victorian city. Population growth had tapered off after the end of the gold rush and was not to experience a further spurt until the wave of assisted passages in the decade before the Great War. The early 1890s saw an economic depres sion which only the crash of 1929 would surpass in severity. The bubble burst, banks failed – especially in Victoria – and politicians fell with them as harsh economic realities exposed their own financial dealings. The decade was marked by intense dispute and bitterness between capital and labour, widespread strikes and lock-outs bordering on armed confrontation between the two sides. Prices for primary produce fell disastrously, taking wages and conditions with them.

42 A Military History of Australia 
The orthodox response to the economic crisis was applied by all colonial governments, and the impact of the resultant reductions in public expendi ture was felt by the infant colonial defence forces. Against this background the colonies moved hesitantly towards Federation and, in both the 1880s and at the end of the century, took their first steps towards the development of that expeditionary force mentality which was to characterise so much of Australian defence policy for the succeeding sixty years. 
Developments in the colonies in this period must be seen also in the context of the policy of imperial defence which sought to spread the military bur dens of empire. This, after all, had been the overt justification for the with drawal of troops from the self-governing colonies in the first place. Such a policy did not leap fully formed from the brow of Whitehall; the idea attracted much talk but painfully little action. Benjamin Disraeli’s Crystal Palace speech in 1872, in which he spoke of the creation of a military code for the colonies, was not followed by any action in this direction when the Conservatives came to power after the 1874 election. Of course, from London’s perspective there were many pressures and issues more important than the views and requirements of the antipodean colonies. The princi pal imperial military needs of the age were home defence and the defence of India; the acquisition of new interests and possessions such as the Suez Canal placed further demands upon those resources. There was pressure too from the Admiralty to end the dispersal of the Royal Navy, brought about by the Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
role of world policeman which the navy characteristically played but which would give way increasingly to other roles closer to home as the century drew to a close. And the picture was further complicated still by the fact that the self-governing colonies did not speak with one voice, or present one set of strategic problems. 
The departure of the British army created a particular requirement for the establishment of standing defence forces in the colonies, to stand in relation to the volunteer forces in the same way as the British regulars had done before 1870. The results were not impressive, at least initially and, although the opportunity might have been taken to move towards a federal system, at least for defence or in imitation of Canadian Confederation, intercolonial rivalry ensured that defence measures continued on a colony-by-colony basis until the end of the 19th century. 
If the strategic environment in which the Australian colonies operated had changed little, the basis on which to construct colonial defence forces was less than promising. The Volunteers continued, of course, although the Land Grant schemes were discontinued in most of the colonies by the mid-1870s. The first colony to set about raising a permanent paid defence force was

New South Wales in 1871, a move which resulted in the formation of a battery of artillery and two companies of infantry. This was in addition to the twenty-eight companies of the Volunteer Rifles and the nine batteries of artillery volunteers which existed on a colony-wide basis. Victoria created a small permanent unit which may have fulfilled some role as garrison artillery but whose primary function appears to have been as a recruiting force for the colonial police and prisons service. Here too the Volunteers continued in existence, manning batteries at various sites around Port Phillip Bay and fielding detachments at various centres. Of significance too was the purchase of the ironclad monitor Cerberus, ordered from, and partly paid for by, the Admiralty, and sailed from Chatham by a colonial crew. It arrived in Port Phillip Bay on 9 April 1871 and saw out its service as a port defence vessel and as flagship of the Victorian Colonial Navy. With a top speed of six knots, no seagoing capacity worth speaking of, and a consumption of thirty tons of coal per day on its commissioning voyage to Melbourne, it was hardly the basis for the projection of colonial naval power. 
The periodic war scares and alarms by which colonial defence preparations may be charted in the first half of the 19th century continued after 1870. A further war scare in 1878 saw Disraeli reinforce the garrison on Malta with drafts of troops from India. It affected colonial defences in two ways. First, it prompted a statement by the Colonial Secretary in the House of Com mons that the colonial forces maintained by the self-governing colonies were Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press.

liable for service not only in the colonies which raised and maintained them, but also for dispatch and service outside the colony according to regulations drawn up by the governor. Secondly, the debate over Disraeli’s move led to the setting up of a Royal Commission by the Colonial Secretary to inquire into the state of the defences of British possessions abroad, and this necessitated the expression of some colonial opinion. The second volume of the Commis sion’s report dealt with the defence problems of the Australasian colonies. 
The recommendations of the Carnarvon Commission set the tone for the discussion of defence matters between London and the Australian colonies for the rest of the century and into the first decade of the next. This was especially true of naval policies. The Commission quoted with approval the findings of an imperial officer, Major-General Sir William Jervois, that the defence of commerce and communication should remain an imperial respon sibility and that the colonies should contribute to the defence of ports and coaling stations from their own resources. Localised colonial naval forces were opposed, strongly, but the principle of colonial financial contributions to the costs of naval protection was introduced, despite the objections of the Premier of New South Wales, Sir Henry Parkes. Parkes appeared before the

Commission and stated that, while the colonies would doubtless make their resources available for the common defence in time of war, the principle of shared costs through subsidy would carry with it a claim for shared respon sibility in decision-making. Not all the colonial dignitaries echoed this view, but it was a foretaste of things to come and was to be reflected by Canadian as well as Australian colonial statesmen in subsequent years. 
Parkes was not the only colonial political figure to take an interest in local defence. In 1876 the Premier of New South Wales, John Robertson, had forwarded to London a request, on behalf of his government and those of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia, for the services of an impe rial officer who might give the colonial administrations ‘good professional advice’ on the state of their defences. The request went so far as to specify the officer desired, Sir William Drummond Jervois of the Royal Engineers. At that time Chief Administrator of the Straits Settlements, he had already acted as adviser to the Canadian government and had a background in planning for the defence of Britain itself. He was an uncommonly well-qualified and senior officer for the job required. Unfortunately he was also unavailable in the short term, but – when the colonies declined the proffered services of another imperial inspector – Lord Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary, released Jervois early from his term as Chief Administrator in the interests of facilitating colonial interest in colonial defence matters. 
Jervois was assisted by another Royal Engineer, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
Scratchley, who had experience of the Australian colonies (his wife came from Victoria) and of the usual fate of reports into their defences. This highly able pair demonstrated once again the enormously influential role played by a handful of Royal Engineer officers in the 19th-century colonies, whether in helping to establish their economic infrastructure or in more specifically military matters. At the time of their investigations, several of the colonies had recently completed royal commissions of inquiry into the state of their defence forces, but the Jervois–Scratchley mission was the first time that a systematic survey of all the colonies (except Western Australia) was completed on the ground by the same team of investigators. 
As noted, the basis of their reports was the understanding that the defence of the Australian colonies was linked to the wider concerns of imperial defence, and that the Royal Navy was the guarantor of security. Both officers were navalists, and believed that the distance of the colonies from poten tial aggressors and the shield provided by the Royal Navy meant that the threat to the colonies would take the form commonly of raids and short term lodgements. As engineers, they tended to adopt the ‘bricks and mortar’ solution to the defence of ports and other strategic sites which, given their

assumptions and the technology of the day, was good sense. Fortifications served by batteries of guns would be supported by mobile field forces to guard against enemy landings that might outflank the defenders. The recom mendations were acted upon, in general, and the colonial administrations embarked upon a building program in Sydney, Newcastle, Port Phillip Bay, Hobart, Moreton Bay, and Adelaide, the fruits of which can still be seen on South and Middle Heads in Sydney, at Fort Scratchley in Newcastle, at Queenscliff in Victoria and elsewhere. Although the size and detail of the colonial defence forces themselves would fluctuate, this scheme remained the basis of territorial defence in the colonies until Federation. 
Direct payment schemes were introduced in the course of the late 1870s and 1880s, in order to open the part-time units to men of the working classes for whom the costs of providing uniform and equipment, coupled with the wages lost through attendance at parades, precluded involvement. These partially paid volunteers, the militia, often existed alongside ‘pure’ volunteer units. By the mid-1880s all the colonies except Western Australia enjoyed this mix of militia and volunteer soldiers, although the volunteers went into temporary decline until the middle of the following decade. Victo ria in fact disbanded all volunteer units as part of the defence reorganisation of 1884, incorporating some into the newly raised militia units. In Queens land the payment of volunteers while in annual camp was abolished in 1880, and in 1884 under the provisions of the Queensland Defence Act the colony Copyright © 2008.

set up a dual system of paid militia in the metropolitan area, unpaid volun teers in rural areas, and a reserve of former militia members. Officers were almost always men of standing in their communities, members of the pro fessions, retired imperial officers and politicians. In rural areas the officers were often the sons of the local squattocracy, with the other ranks provided from the rural labour force which worked the pastoral stations. Other units were formed by groups and organisations within colonial society; early rifle companies in Tasmania were provided by the Masonic lodges, and the Aus tralian Natives’ Association raised a company in Adelaide. Private patronage played a part also, and the Victorian Horse Artillery (the Rupertswood bat tery) was formed and paid for by Sir William Clarke, partly as a plaything for his son. 
There was little uniformity in arms and equipment between the various colonies. All bought their arms from Britain, often being sold obsolescent models which were in the process of being phased out of British service. Thus the various forts around Australia continued to use rifled muzzle loading (RML) guns long after breech-loading ordnance had been intro duced elsewhere; many of the infantry companies were issued with the old

46 A Military History of Australia 
Martini-Henry single-shot rifle, while the British army was being equipped with the magazine-fed Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield. The units themselves borrowed heavily from British patterns, and several colonies boasted Scot tish and Irish regiments (‘national corps’ as they were known), complete with kilts and bonnets, and cavalry regiments dressed like dragoons or equipped with lances. By the 1890s this was giving way to khaki drab and the slouch hat, although the national corps continued to exist until the advent of com pulsory military training early in the next century. 
The depression of the 1890s had a marked effect upon the fortunes of the colonial forces, some units folding for lack of funds and men. In South Aus tralia the navy, comprising HMCS Protector, was paid off, and the military forces suffered a reduction in the budget of £12 000. In 1893 the annual camp was made voluntary, to save costs, and men who left were not replaced. In Tasmania half the permanent force was discharged and all funds for training were withdrawn. In Victoria the permanent force was reduced and those remaining suffered a cut in pay – the militia rate dropped from £12 per annum in 1891 to £6 5s. in 1894. In New South Wales the annual camps were cancelled in 1892 and 1893, and pay for the militia likewise was reduced. All these measures led to resignations from both the permanent and militia forces, which reduced costs, and effectiveness, still further. The early 1890s was marked by widespread industrial unrest in the wider community, and units of the colonial defence forces were used in strike-breaking roles in Copyright © 2008.

Queensland ‘in aid of the civil power’ and in support of the pastoralists who had imported non-union labour to work in the shearing sheds. In Victoria the forces were called out during the Great Maritime Strike in 1890, best remembered perhaps for the ill-chosen words of Colonel Tom Price, who allegedly instructed his men to ‘fire low and lay the bastards out’ should the order to fire be given (it wasn’t, and he later claimed to have been mis quoted). There was a revival of the Volunteers after the middle of the decade, and many of those who had been forced by economic circumstance to reduce their involvement in the part-time forces were able to resume their interest. But the depression of the 1890s was severe and many like John Monash, a Melbourne engineer and captain in the Victorian garrison artillery, did not fully recover financially until the decade’s end. 
For all the efforts of the colonists themselves, the cornerstone of Australian defence remained the ships of the Royal Navy, beginning with those based on the Australia Station. The navy itself had undergone change as a result of reforms overseen by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Hugh Childers, in 1869. These had begun to reverse the decline in size and quality which had set in and which had seen most of the major developments in naval architecture

and technology in mid-century pioneered by the French. They led also to the redistribution of naval vessels. This was motivated as much by desires for economy as any predominant naval strategy but, in the course of the 1870s and 1880s, under the influence of Admiral Sir John Colomb and other apos tles of sea power, the notion of the interdependence of the empire and the need to protect the empire’s lines of communications became accepted as the basis of imperial defence. In addition, by the 1880s the security of the metropolitan centre was seen as paramount, a notion which did not neces sarily contradict the concerns of imperial defence but which was to introduce strains within the relationship between Britain and the dominions, since colo nial politicians were disinclined to accept that the navy’s brief included the defence of the empire as a whole and not only or merely that of the Aus tralian colonies. At the Intercolonial Conference in 1881, for example, the Australian colonies had sought an enhanced naval presence in Australian waters but had rejected the principle of colonial contribution. These various trends were to culminate in the Naval Defence Agreement of 1887 and the Naval Defence Act of 1889, which by British legislative fiat established the ‘two-power standard’ and which laid down that the strength of the Royal Navy was to be maintained at a level sufficient to beat the navies of any other two powers combined. 
One of Jervois’ recommendations had concerned the acquisition of local naval defence capabilities by the colonies themselves, a recommendation Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
adopted by a number of the colonial administrations. Jervois’ idea was that this would then free the ships of the Royal Navy for wider duties. The Admi ralty resisted strenuously attempts to break up the squadron in Sydney and disperse it among the various colonial ports, but were happy to agree to the provision of colonial naval forces as a means of humouring the colonists and ensuring that they did not become so disenchanted with British arrange ments for their security as to consider severing relations. But the Sea Lords took a sufficiently jaundiced view of colonial navies to refuse the sanction of the White Ensign for colonial naval vessels, not wishing to be embroiled in an incident or, worse, a war, as the result of the actions of an inexperienced colonial officer. 
The 1887 agreement was a step towards a co-operative scheme for impe rial defence. At heart it sought to resolve two problems – should colonial navies be an alternative to or a part of the Royal Navy squadron, and should naval defence be provided at imperial or colonial expense? The Russian scare of 1885 had added urgency to sporadically surfacing colonial defence con cerns, and the agreement itself was the fruit of long negotiations between the Flag Officer commanding the Australia Station, Rear-Admiral Sir George

48 A Military History of Australia 
Tryon, and the colonial governments. The agreement, which had been the major defence issue placed before the first Colonial Conference held in Lon don in April 1887, required the Admiralty to station an additional squadron of five fast cruisers and two torpedo gunboats for the defence of Australasian maritime trade. The colonies were to pay £126 000 annually towards its costs, with New Zealand’s share being £20 000. The Auxiliary Squadron was not to leave Australian waters without the agreement of the colonial governments, and the agreement was to run for ten years. The New Zealan ders wanted two of the ships based in New Zealand waters, but had to settle for regular visits. 
The Admiralty regarded the colonial veto on deployment of the auxiliary squadron as a fundamental hindrance to sensible naval strategy, and soon sought to have it revoked. Their fears were aided by the proprietorial attitude of the colonies to ‘their’ ships, and by the complaints received whenever one or other colony felt that it received insufficiently frequent visits. In fact, the colonies got the better end of the deal and it was to take the Admiralty sixteen years to remove the worst of the restrictions. But the agreement had the effect also of killing off any desires to form colonial blue-water navies. The colonists wanted defence on the cheap, and they got it; the Admiralty preserved most of the elements of undivided command and control which were important to it, and received some assistance in bearing the burden of naval expenditure. One thing the agreement did not do was to spark Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
enthusiasm in other self-governing colonies for similar schemes, a blow to those who hoped for a naval contribution from the whole empire, and who dreamed even of imperial federation. 
Such dreams, and the hopes entertained in London about colonial willing ness to serve in the cause of empire, were given a considerable fillip by the events of 1885. Too much weight should not be placed upon the dispatch of a New South Wales contingent to the Sudan that year. It was a relatively minor incident, but it provides evidence both of the growing willingness of colonial society to take part in the wars of empire in certain circumstances, and tells us something about the attitudes of colonial society to war and empire at this time. 
The circumstances in which the force was raised may be dealt with briefly. The news of the death of General Sir Charles Gordon at Khartoum at the hands of the Mahdi’s forces reached Australia on 6 February, sparking a wave of public grief and outrage of which perhaps only the Victorian age was capable. The very next morning a retired British officer, Major-General Sir Edward Strickland, suggested via the pages of the morning newspaper that the colony should offer to field an expeditionary force to help revenge

The Colonial Period, 1870–1901 49 
Gordon. The idea was seized upon by the acting Premier, William Bede Dalley, and, without recourse to parliament, the raising of a force of infantry and artillery was at once undertaken. Thirty officers, 740 men and 218 horses were embarked within two weeks of Dalley’s offer to London. This was the first occasion on which forces in the pay of a self-governing colony had served in an imperial war; offers had been made before, and had been rejected, and the offers received from Victoria, South Australia, New Zealand and Canada on this occasion, likewise, were rejected. The offer from New South Wales was accepted through a mix of judicious timing, the particular circumstances of Gordon’s death and the resultant criticism of William Ewart Gladstone’s administration in London, and the urgings of the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Augustus Loftus, who cabled London that refusal of the offer of assistance would ‘be deeply felt in the colony’. With an eye to morale both in London and Sydney, the British government accepted the offer, more or less graciously. 
The contingent was dispatched amid enormous crowds and considerable celebration on 3 March. It reached the Sudan at the end of March, but in approximately two months of ‘operations’ the men saw practically no fight ing, spending much of their time providing guard details for the railway which was being constructed by native labour to meet the logistic require ments of Sir Garnet Wolseley’s Anglo-Egyptian army. It was not that there was no fighting to be done, rather that the New South Wales contingent Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
missed out on nearly all of it. A couple of men were wounded slightly in the concluding stages of the Battle of Tamai (little more than a punitive skir mish), but the fatalities among the force were entirely the result of disease and accident. The force returned to Sydney on 23 June, to a very muted reception indeed. The great hopes which the good citizens of New South Wales had placed in their contingent had not been realised – through no fault of the men, it should be added – and the derision and parsimony with which they were received on their return was in marked contrast to the scenes which had heralded their dispatch. 
The significance of the event lies in two aspects: the existence of opposition to the sending of the contingent and the disinclination of the colony and the troops to serve elsewhere at the discretion of imperial authorities. The crisis in relations with Russia which led to the diversion of troops from the Sudan to India and the postponement (by thirteen years) of a settling of scores with the Mahdi prompted Dalley to offer the services of the contingent for use in India, ‘to assert the arms of England wherever our help is needed’. The mood in the colony had shifted, however, and opinion held that in the event of war with Russia the place of the contingent was in New South Wales, assisting

50 A Military History of Australia 
in the defence of home and hearth. The men themselves were asked whether they would volunteer to serve elsewhere but the result was disappointing, with few men coming forward. In part it was prompted by concerns for the defence of their own colony but there is evidence to suggest that many of the men who declined to volunteer for possible service in India were casting a vote of no confidence in the contingent’s officers. The change of attitude in the colony itself suggests strongly that at this stage at least the colonial Australians were not prepared blindly to send forces to any and every imperial emergency. 
The question of opposition to the dispatch of the contingent is more dif ficult. The claims for a nascent ‘peace’ or ‘anti-war’ movement at this time seem exaggerated and owe not a little to the efforts of later generations to create a tradition of anti-war activism back to the dispatch of the first expe ditionary force. The serious opposition to Dalley’s efforts came from within the mainstream political process, headed by Parkes who used the occasion as a means of getting back into public life, from which he had ‘retired’ in 1884. Opposition from this source in fact centred not on the contingent itself but on the manner in which it had been sent; the government had failed to consult the legislature or the full Cabinet and had acted without the approval of the Colonial Treasurer. When the matter was placed before the parliament, the Australian Military Contingent Bill was passed by a wide margin. Within the parliamentary sphere, support for the contingent tended Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
to come from native-born Australians – men like Dalley, frequently with convict ancestry and, in his case, a Catholic to boot – while opposition came often from those with close English connections who echoed liberal senti ments opposed to the subjugation of the Sudan. In that sense the dispatch of troops became a nationalist issue, one in which amends were to be made for the ‘convict stain’. On the other hand, opposition from journals such as the Bulletin stemmed from the radical, anti-imperial nationalism which was to find its chief expression in literary and artistic forms in the 1890s. The dropping away of popular support for the contingent had less to do with any anti-war or pacifist sentiment than with the frustration of popular expectations, which had been pitched impossibly high in the emotional and jingoistic atmosphere of the early months of 1885. 
The last fifteen years of the century were marked by attempts both by the British and the colonies themselves to impose some measure of cohesion upon defence matters. The creation of the Colonial Defence Committee in April 1885 was the first attempt in London to establish a permanent agency charged with guiding the colonies on defence matters. The system of itin erant and irregular reporting, of the kind which Scratchley and Jervois had

The Colonial Period, 1870–1901 51 
undertaken, was replaced now with a small standing committee of the Colo nial Office to which all the colonies could refer their defence arrangements for discussion, guidance and approval. Its first task was to discuss the defence of the West Indies, but in August 1885 the Colonial Defence Committee cir culated a request to all colonial authorities asking for details of their defence forces and infrastructure, largely in the interests of collecting for the first time a systematic body of information concerning colonial defence. Colonial gov ernments were requested also to forward copies of their defence plans. 
The committee laboured busily on its task, reviewing the local defence needs of the empire. Within two years it had prepared twenty-six memoranda on such issues, and had made recommendations in a further fifty-three cases. Between 1885 and 1891 it met on fifty-eight occasions, considered 470 items of business, scrutinised the defences of thirty-seven colonies, and assisted a further nineteen to draw up defence plans of their own. In 1890 it even composed a memorandum on the advantages of federation in the defence of Australia. The Colonial Defence Committee aroused some antagonism from both the Admiralty and the War Office, which it resisted successfully, but equally found the self-governing colonies disinclined to co-operate on occa sions; the Canadians repeatedly delayed drawing up plans for their defence, the New Zealanders reported regularly but none the less did not submit their first defence scheme until 1899, while the government of Tasmania never submitted one at all! When the new Commonwealth government in Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
Australia made it clear that it would establish a national fleet of its own early in the new century, the countervailing views of the committee could not sway them. But the establishment of the committee was an important step in the systematisation of imperial defence, and it remained a useful tool until it was subsumed by the Committee of Imperial Defence in the aftermath of the Haldane reforms in 1904 by which the British army, and the governmental machinery for strategic direction, were brought into the 20th century. 
Colonial reactions were prompted by the pressures for political federa tion and the renewed spectre of European colonial expansion close to Aus tralian territory. To fears of the French, Russians and Americans were added the Germans, whose claims to the Solomons and the northern part of New Guinea in August 1884 led to the declaration of a British protectorate over south-east New Guinea. This region was of greater concern to the colonial authorities than it was to the imperial ones and earlier demands in 1883, especially from Queensland, that imperial authority be asserted in the area had been rejected. Although the outcome had proven satisfactory in some senses, the experience generated considerable criticism of British ‘tardiness’ in protecting what was seen in the colonies as a legitimate area of interest,

52 A Military History of Australia 
and led directly to the formation of the Federal Council. Formed to speak to Whitehall ‘with a united voice’ on matters of ‘foreign relations’ which affected the colonies, the council had no powers over the defence forces of the colonies and was not representative, since New South Wales and New Zealand declined to join. It became widely discredited in the 1890s, and was of greater significance in the gathering movement leading to Federation than in the growth of systematic organisation for defence. 
One further consequence of these events was the formation in Victoria of a Department of Defence. Created as part of the defence reorganisation pushed through by the Premier, James Service, in 1883–84 and formalised in the Defence Act of 1883, it was the only colonial department of state created to deal solely with defence matters. F. T. Sargood, a member of the Legisla tive Council and a major in the Volunteers, had been made minister without portfolio in 1883 with responsibility for defence matters; in the following year he was made the first Minister for Defence. Initially the day-to-day run ning of the Victorian forces was placed in the hands of a Council of Defence, but in April 1885 the position was regularised with the appointment of the first secretary of the department, Major-General M. F. Downes, the former Commandant of South Australia. The appointment was used also to assert the primacy of representative civil power over the military, a position con tested actively by the Commandant, Colonel T. R. Disney, RA.

head, although they remained responsible to the minister and thence the government. Other colonies continued to entrust administration and con trol of their defence forces to ministers whose primary responsibilities were in other spheres. 
The drive for federation none the less had an effect upon defence issues, although the commonly held belief that a concern for strong, centrally directed defences was a prime motivation for Federation is not borne out by the evidence. The 1887 Colonial Conference produced not only the Naval Agreement, but concern on the part of the Australian colonies for regu lar, periodic inspection of their forces. The Premier of Queensland and the Defence Minister of Victoria, Samuel Griffith and Sir James Lorimer respec tively, both urged this course upon their fellow delegates, finding general agreement from all except Parkes, who asserted that the colonies should act for themselves and on the basis of their own estimates. Ironically, it was Parkes who was to make the greatest use of the report of Major-General J. Bevan Edwards which resulted. 
Edwards’ Proposed Organisation of the Military Forces of the Australian Colonies conflicted with the views of earlier reports, not least in that he

did not discount the possibility of a strong attack being launched against the Australian colonies by powerful enemy fleets. The overall thrust of his report was that the colonies should federate in the interests of efficient defence. The colonial militias, he argued, which could not operate outside the borders of their own colony, would need to be concentrated to meet an invasion; arms, equipment, training, legislation and rail gauges should all be standardised; the whole should be commanded by an imperial officer in the interests of a unified command, replacing the system whereby each colony’s forces had its own commandant who acted as commander-in-chief. Co-operation was to be the order of the day. 
This report did not find great favour with the Colonial Defence Com mittee which, in common with advice from all sections of Whitehall, had been arguing that the Australian colonies did not face a significant threat because of the global efforts of the Royal Navy and the clear lack of any bases from which potentially hostile forces might stage an invasion. The fed eration of colonial defence efforts clearly was desirable, however, and the Colonial Defence Committee encouraged this development by commenting favourably upon a general plan for Australian defence drafted by a com mittee of all the military commandants which met in October 1894. These plans were duly revised by the Intercolonial Military Committee which met in 1896 and which recommended their implementation to the colonial pre miers. By that stage, however, the impetus for political federation had grown Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
such that military federation was seen increasingly as a consequence rather than as a progenitor of a federal Australia. 
Parkes’ famed Tenterfield Oration in October 1889 used defence as a convenient hook on which to hang the wider issue, and he mentioned this before Edwards had issued his report on the desirability of a federally based defence scheme, indeed before Edwards had even left Hong Kong on his way to Australia. It seems likely that there was some degree of collusion between the two, with Edwards hoping to fill the appointment of Inspector General of the forces which he had recommended should be created, and Parkes requiring an issue which would highlight the ‘common need’ which would help to crystallise the general but as yet unfocused consensus on the Federation issue. That the security of the colonies was not a pressing issue in the 1890s is underscored further by the significant reductions effected in colonial defence budgets as a result of the depression, and by the fact that the great debates in the Federal Conventions which met to argue the case for Federation were more concerned with the role and strength of the Senate, finance, immigration, and the use and misuse of the federal power. Defence featured in the two referendum campaigns, but not prominently.

54 A Military History of Australia 
Support for federal defences and the negotiation of the 1887 Naval Agree ment were two parts of a British program to spread the burden of imperial defence and draw upon the potential contribution which the colonies could make to British military capabilities. The third aspect was the attachment of imperial officers to colonial forces. The commandants of the military forces in the Australian colonies were all British officers, but it was only in 1893 that New South Wales selected its first Commandant from the active list, Lieutenant Colonel E. T. H. Hutton. Other colonies had appointed officers from the active list before this – South Australia’s forces were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel M. F. Downes, an officer of the Royal Artillery, between 1877 and 1885 and again in 1888–93 – but it was more common for the Commandants to be drawn from retired or half-pay officers, and in fact Downes never returned to the British army, retiring in 1884. The British gov ernment exerted pressure against the employment of retired officers, initially by ruling that officers employed by colonial governments were not eligible to draw service pensions during their period of colonial employment. The move was effected by passage of the Superannuation Act of 1887, which deprived retired officers of their pensions if they took up colonial appoint ments, and it is clear that by 1889 the War Office was following an explicit policy favouring the employment in the colonies of officers on the active list. 
There has been some argument, based largely on conjecture, about the role of these officers in the evolution of imperial defence. Hutton proposed Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
a scheme for federal defence upon his arrival, including a proposal for a Defence Council in wartime which would comprise the naval and military commandants and other representatives from each colony, and which would have the power to formulate and implement defence policy. This idea was not adopted, but it does seem clear that Hutton supported the federal idea because of the possibilities which this would provide for utilising Australian manpower in imperial missions and under British command in the event of a war elsewhere in the empire. The Commandant of Victoria, Major General Sir Alexander Tulloch, admitted as much. As in Canada, and again in Australia after Federation, Hutton’s period in New South Wales was marked by public brawling with his nominal political superior, the Premier, over cuts to the defence budget and ‘interference’ in personnel matters. 
Other measures for integrating the colonial contribution to empire defence were discussed and adopted also. At the Colonial Conference in 1897, timed to coincide with Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee – the celebrations for which involved over 70 000 colonial troops from all parts of the empire – defence issues featured prominently. The Naval Agreement was renewed, but the restrictions on the deployment of the Auxiliary Squadron which the

Admiralty found so irksome were not removed, and there was little support from the Australian delegates for an increase in the subsidy. Hopes for a scheme of exchanges of military units foundered also. The desire of the War Office to raise the standard of efficiency of colonial units could not overcome the differing requirements of colonial military legislation, and the program of exchanges which was suggested finally in August 1898 was restricted to forces on the regular establishment. Among the Australian colonies only Queensland and New South Wales agreed to participate, and even then the idea was reduced finally to an exchange of a few officers and NCOs from the Queensland permanent artillery, which did not proceed in any case owing to the war scare in South Africa. It is too simple, however, to see the comman dants merely as agents of London. They were imperial officers to a man, and this obviously shaped their views, but so did their own service in other parts of the empire in colonial campaigns and the conditions which they encoun tered in the Australian colonies. It is probably more realistic to see them as occupying a position somewhere between the aspirations of the metropolitan government and the politics of the colonial ones. 
At the end of the 19th century, therefore, the probability of an effective scheme of imperial defence seemed low, while the attention of the Australian colonies was directed to political Federation and the consequences of the depression rather than to any great level of concern with defence and the security of the colonies. The involvement of New South Wales in the Sudan Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
expedition had not presaged any inclination on the part of the colonies to become involved automatically in the war effort of the empire, and the con dition and preparedness of the local forces had fluctuated wildly depending on the level of threat, real or imagined, pertaining at any given time. The war in South Africa did not change this. 
The crisis in South Africa grew over a number of years, and the declaration of war in 1899 was not unexpected. Afrikaners indeed regarded the Jameson Raid in late 1895 as the real declaration of war, one merely followed by a four-year armed truce. The structural flaws in the British army, which would lead to early disasters to British arms and the long and drawn-out conflict which followed, were not readily apparent to the casual observer in October 1899, and had nothing to do with the offers of assistance which the colonies made. Indeed the very nature of these offers must be scrutinised, for it is clear that the old explanations of popular imperialism and empire loyalism are not sufficient to explain the manner in which colonial soldiers found themselves in South Africa. 
The spontaneous gestures of support for Britain really came after the string of disasters at Magersfontein, Stormberg and Colenso in December 1899,

56 A Military History of Australia 
dubbed ‘Black Week’. Before the outbreak of war, however, the gestures of support were more calculated and manufactured. In early July the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, instructed the governors of Canada, Victoria and New South Wales to request of their ministries ‘spon taneous’ offers of troops in the event of hostilities. All three administrations refused. But on 11 July the Queensland government offered 250 mounted infantry with machine-guns. This offer may have been unsolicited; it also seems likely that the volunteers did not at that stage exist and that the rec ommendation for the action had come from the Queensland Commandant, Major-General Howel Gunter. The offer was made on the understanding that the British would foot the bill, and at least one historian has argued that the unwillingness of Victoria and New South Wales may have stemmed from considerations of military expenditure as well. On 4 September the Premier of South Australia offered volunteers ‘for service beyond the colony’, although again it is unclear whether the offer was prompted by unofficial commu nication with the Governor. Although the colonial premiers were divided in their views over the desirability of offering troops, the various colonial commandants appear to have suffered no such doubts (although they dis agreed initially about the form which a contribution might take), and in conference in Melbourne from 30 September to 4 October they devised a scheme whereby the colonies would send a combined Australian contingent of 2000 men. Chamberlain vetoed the idea, however, because the War Office Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.
wanted only small contingents which could be parcelled out among imperial units and because, in any case, Chamberlain’s concern at this stage was with appearances. 
By various means, including an undertaking that the imperial authorities would bear all costs associated with the dispatch of contingents, the govern ment of New South Wales was induced to offer the services of a detachment of the New South Wales Lancers, at that time preparing to return to Australia after some months’ training in Britain at their own expense. By 6 October all governments had offered contingents of troops, subject to parliamen tary consent; clearly no one wished to repeat Dalley’s experience in 1885. In all colonies such approval was forthcoming, although in Queensland and South Australia the voting was close. The rather hesitant manner in which the pledge of troops was made reflected both financial stringency so soon after the depression and a sense that the war in South Africa, if and when it came, did not represent any crisis. Once colonial administrations began to make offers, intercolonial rivalry and self-image meant that all would follow suit. The role of the commandants should not be underestimated, but neither should the enthusiasm of colonial officers faced with the prospect of active

service. Of popular support or agitation for involvement there was, at this stage, little sign. 
The Colonial Office laid down that Australian contingents were to num ber 125 men, two contingents each from New South Wales and Victoria, one each from the other colonies. For reasons which mystify still, the stipulation was for infantry units, not mounted ones, although after the war it was stated that the term ‘infantry’ had been held to include ‘mounted infantry’. The confusion may simply have been the result of a badly worded cable. Equally, the War Office distrusted ‘irregular cavalry’ and General Sir Redvers Buller, who commanded initially in South Africa, had not been impressed by the standard of the New South Wales Lancers when he had observed them at Aldershot that year. In any case, within months of arrival the colonial foot were turned into mounted rifles. Enlistment for the contingents was slower than expected among the militia and permanent forces which had been expected to furnish recruits for the forces. Applications for commissions on the other hand were heavily oversubscribed, and political influence played as much part in selection as prior military experience. In all, eight contingents left Australia for South Africa, a total of 16 175 men. (This figure reflects gross, not net, enlistments since it counts men who rejoined subsequent con tingents as separate enlistments. The number of individual Australians who served in South Africa is not known, but is in the vicinity of 10 000.)

ones – the Citizens’ Bushmen and the Imperial Bushmen – were recruited in response to public support in 1900 and to the pressing need for mounted troops in a campaign in which mobility was the key factor. The final units to sail did so after Federation, as battalions of the Australian Commonwealth Horse, although the last of these arrived too late to see any action. The total numbers involved do not suggest a strenuous military effort on the part of the Australian colonies and, if the will had existed, there seems little reason to doubt that a very much larger force could have been sent. (New Zealand, with a much smaller population base, sent ten contingents totalling 6500 men.) 
The question of popular attitudes to involvement in the Boer War has occupied historians rather more than has the actual involvement itself. In part this stems from a concern with opposition to later conflicts, but it is clear that there was concerted opposition to involvement in South Africa associated both with the rise of the Australian Labor Party and the labour movement generally, and which drew some of its impetus from the very much greater division over the war in Britain itself. By the end of 1899 there was a concerted campaign against ‘pro-Boers’ and ‘disloyal elements’; G. Arnold Wood nearly lost his Chair in History at the University of Sydney because

of his opposition to involvement, and politicians who agreed with him were vilified as traitors at rowdy public meetings, although there is little evidence that this translated into votes.

purposes. In so far as generalisations can be made, it is clear that the ALP was strongly opposed, but it is not necessarily the case that working-class opinion mirrored this opposition. The radical nationalist school centred on the Bulletin was opposed vociferously but, like intellectuals in most periods of Australian history, its influence was confined largely to those already convinced, and in any case even it modified its opposition during the crisis which followed the initial Boer victories. Irish-Catholic opinion, traditionally regarded as the single greatest source of dissenting viewpoints, does not lend itself to simplistic classification either. Class was an important factor, but so too was the issue of native-born versus Irish-born; the clergy were largely Irish-born, and this was an important determinant in their opposition to British actions in South Africa, as it would be again after the Easter Rising in Ireland in 1916. Whether such ‘official’ opinion can be regarded as representative of the views of those whom it seeks to represent is a problem in assessing both pro- and anti-war cases, and not only in relation to South Africa. 
Popular support was probably widespread, especially at the war’s outset and after the early disasters in December 1899. By early 1901 the public was

becoming disenchanted with a long war, one moreover which did not con form to the pattern of rousing charges and climactic battles which popular belief identified with war. Australian casualties cannot be used to explain this falling off in popular enthusiasm, since these were very low and affected few of those who remained behind. The Morant–Handcock affair and the fiasco at Wilmansrust (see below) came too late in the war to have much effect, and in any case were not really digested until after the conclusion of hostilities. 
The sense in which the experience of war in South Africa failed to match popular expectations affected those Australians who fought there also. The South African war may be divided into three phases: the first months of the war to early 1900, in which the Boers scored a number of impressive early victories; the period after the appointment of Lord Roberts as Commander in-Chief, during which the British relieved Boer pressure on isolated positions like Ladysmith and Mafeking, conquered the territory of the Boer Republics themselves, and won the conventional war; and the period under Kitchener from late 1900, in which the remaining Boer commandos fought a savage guerrilla struggle and the veldt was fenced, depopulated and scorched in an effort to bring the ‘bitter enders’ to the peace table. Australians took little part in the first phase, the first contingent arriving at the Cape just before ‘Black Week’ and the majority being assigned initially to lines of communica tion duties. The first significant action involved 200 men of the Queensland Mounted Infantry, together with Canadians and some British regulars, in an Copyright © 2008. Cambridge University Press.

attack on a laager at Sunnyside in the Cape Colony on 1 January 1900. A tiny firefight, it none the less buoyed the reputation of the Australians, who had acquitted themselves well in their first action. Lord Roberts arrived in January 1900, and promptly began to alter the strategy and dispositions of his forces. In an attempt to increase the mobility of his striking force, he raised irregular companies of mounted rifles from among the Cape colonists and requested that the five companies of Australian infantry then in camp at Enslin be converted to mounted infantry. The newly mounted unit proved its worth in the operations around Colesberg and in actions at Slingersfontein and Pink Hill. 
Such successful actions were used as occasions to hail the arrival of the Australian soldier. War correspondent A. B. Paterson reported that the British authorities were eager to obtain more troops from Canada and Australia because of the fighting qualities demonstrated by those of the first contingent. After Pink Hill Australian correspondents waxed lyrical. The Melbourne Argus suggested a great monument to the Victorian dead in the action to remind future generations of ‘the heroic measure . . . which they could never surpass but from which they must never decline’.

expressed pride that Australia’s military representatives had displayed the highest military qualities in the field: ‘plainly wool and wheat are not our greatest products’. More important still, British observers heralded it as ‘an exhibition of resolute courage’. Major G. A.

many Victorian towns. But there was a fundamental mismatch between the relatively insignificant nature of the actions and the overwhelming reactions of many Australians to them. 
The second contingent arrived in February 1900, and the Australians took part in Roberts’ great drive to Bloemfontein and Kimberley, in the war of manoeuvre against the Boers which would culminate in the capture of Pre toria. The last major set-piece battle of the war was fought at Paardeberg on 18 February, in which a force of 6000 Boers under General Piet Cronje was defeated but in which the Australian units played little part. Although the remainder of this phase of the war would see a number of skirmishes and actions involving the Australians, such as at Diamond Hill, the main fighting was over, to be replaced by long periods in the saddle during the advance to the Boer capitals. The mounted infantry units were placed under the command of Brigadier-General E. T. H. Hutton where they dominated the force, comprising one-third of his 6000 men. Four of Hutton’s eight staff officers were Australians, and the men wore a large letter ‘A’ sewn on the side of their helmets. Hutton was a great believer in the virtues of mounted infantry and in the capacities of colonial troops; ‘fine looking workmanlike men’, who none the less were ‘ignorant of their own value’. Casualties from battle were light, those from disease far heavier and heavier still among the horses. Hutton’s brigade lost one man killed and thirty-five wounded in the drive on Pretoria, but lost 18 per cent of its horses.

The lack of any real fighting and the transformation of the war into a guer rilla war in which the civilian population was the main target of operations led to disillusionment among the Australians. Burning farms and herding women and children into concentration camps was not what the colonial volunteers had joined for, and by late 1900 there was widespread disaffec tion among them. In October Lord Roberts ordered that the first colonial contingents could return home should they desire to do so. This led to fur ther disaffection among men of the second contingent, who had to wait for the anniversary of their arrival in South Africa before being eligible to return to Australia. The first contingent reached Australia in December 1900, to a nation in the flush of Federation and cheered by Roberts’ praise of its soldiers’ efforts. The approbation of imperial officers which these Austral Britons sought so eagerly was given freely, and the returning men received a rousing homecoming which was in fact to be the last major outpouring of public enthusiasm for the war. 
The subsequent Bushmen’s and draft contingents were raised from a much larger section of the population than the first two had been, and the vacancies in them were oversubscribed. It was in these contingents that the romantic

62 A Military History of Australia 
bush figures who featured in the literature of the 1890s were fused with the citizen soldier who was to take their place as the embodiment of the Australian ethos. Having discovered the virtues of colonial mounted units, the imperial authorities could not get enough of them. Calls went out to Australia, Canada and New Zealand for more mounted soldiers, and the Imperial Bushmen of the fourth contingent were raised on the basis of just such a direct appeal from Chamberlain. Once again the colonials won praise for their dash and gallantry at actions such as Elands River (4–16 August 1900), Rhenosterkop (29 November) and Haartebeestefontein (21 March 1901), but these were small-scale actions in which the Boers were occasion ally brought to battle in the long sweeps across the veldt. It was hard work, and occasionally dangerous, but almost never glamorous. 
That the Boer was not defeated and was still capable of hitting back was demonstrated to a unit of the fifth contingent, the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles, at Wilmansrust on 12 June 1901. Surprised after dark by a party of 140 enemy, eighteen Australians were killed and forty-two wounded within minutes, the rest fleeing in panic or being captured. Since the Boers had no use for prisoners the latter were released quickly, but more than one hundred horses were killed and the same number taken to replenish enemy stocks. It was a rout and a humiliation but one which made little difference to the final outcome, although it certainly lifted Boer morale. Its sequel, however, was even less happy.

livered curs’, three Victorians were charged with incitement to mutiny after suggesting to their comrades that they should not take the field again under such a commander. They were court-martialled and sentenced to death, the sentences being commuted. The men were later released before the comple tion of their sentences, and the matter caused questions to be asked in federal parliament. Little sympathy was evinced for the men, who were under the jurisdiction of the British Army Act in any case, but the incident prompted Barton to request from the British authorities details of courts martial involv ing Australians. The Wilmansrust affair was notable also for the alacrity with which the shortcomings of the raw Australian troops were blamed upon alleged deficiencies in the imperial officers placed over them. No such spe cial pleading applied in the cases of Lieutenants Morant and Handcock, tried and executed in February 1902 for shooting prisoners and for the murder of a German missionary suspected of acting as a courier for the Boers. The fact that they were officers may explain why their sentences were carried out, rather than commuted. There was little sympathy for them in Australia, and the executions only became a cause cel´ ebre ` for later and rather different generations.

The Colonial Period, 1870–1901 63 
The final contingents sent to South Africa went as the Australian Common wealth Horse. Unfortunately these first truly Australian units contributed little to Australian military history, the war having ended before half of the eight battalions involved even reached the Cape. Many Australians served against the Boers in other than Australian units. Many of the gold prospectors on the Rand fields before the war had been Australians and they joined the Cape colonial units and other irregular forces. Precise figures are impossible to ascertain but such enlistments must have numbered several thousand. 
The Australian contribution to the South African war is difficult to assess. At no time did they make a contribution in their own right, serving always as part of other forces which included Canadians, New Zealanders, Cape colonials, British Yeomanry and regular units. Nearly 450 000 British and empire troops took the field in South Africa, of whom 31 000 were colonial volunteers from outside South Africa, with some 52 000 coming from South Africa itself. It is difficult to generalise about the Australian contingents also. The first two, drawn largely from the part-time militias of the colonies, had some military background and acquitted themselves well, and it was they who set the standard by which Australian troops were judged in this war. But comparisons with later contingents are made more difficult by the very different nature of the fighting. Later contingents were marked by some indiscipline: men of the third contingent burned the offices of a Cape Town newspaper which favoured the Boer cause and there were disturbances on Copyright © 2008.

some of the troopships, but there had been incidents involving grievances over pay among the first contingent also. The rout at Wilmansrust and the Morant–Handcock affair were incidents specific to time and place, and not indications of general weakness or shortcomings in colonial troops. 
Weaknesses there were none the less. The Australians were noted as good horsemen but bad horse masters, and their standards of marksmanship were deficient. Several witnesses before the Elgin Commission which inquired into the conduct of the war thought the Australians to be soldiers of great poten tial. Their officers were singled out for criticism, however, as poorly trained and generally inadequate. This was a complaint voiced by the New South Wales contingent in the Sudan, and would feature again during Hamilton’s tour of inspection just before the outbreak of war in 1914. The dash, initiative and courage of the colonials – and not just the Australians – was commented upon widely, a judgement supported in the case of the Australians by the award of five Victoria Crosses, all gained for rescuing wounded men under fire. Other decorations were handed out rather freely (twenty-three awards of the CB – Companion of the Bath – and no fewer than sixty-two awards

of the DSO – Distinguished Service Order), which debased the currency and led to at least one celebrated libel suit. 
Australian casualties were light. Officially, 29 officers and 222 other ranks were killed in action or died of wounds, and 9 officers and 258 others died of disease. (As with all casualty statistics, these figures are open to challenge, and a revised total of 606 dead has been suggested, almost exactly divided between battle and non-battle casualties. This figure, however, includes Aus tralians serving in non-Australian units.) Seventy-seven officers and 658 men were wounded, 5 officers and 99 others taken prisoner, and 43 men were listed as missing, for a total casualty list of 120 officers and 1280 men. By comparison, South African volunteers suffered over 8000 casualties, and there were more than 100 000 casualties of all kinds among the British and empire forces, 22 000 of them fatal. More than 400 000 horses and mules (237 456 and 196 674 respectively) died on the British side alone. 
From the viewpoint of the Australian colonies, the Boer War is seen best as the logical outcome of a process which had been building for several decades. The same urges and pressures in the popular mind which mani fested themselves in Australia were seen in New Zealand and Canada, with certain Francophone variations in the latter case. Enthusiasm for empire and the wars of empire was not a specifically Australian phenomenon, and neither was the desire to dispatch contingents to assist the mother country.

carried with it the need to provide for local defence from local resources. Inevitably, given that the Australian colonies remained part of a great and expanding empire, those forces would ultimately be involved in the wars of that empire as maturing colonial societies sought to share the costs as well as the fruits of empire. Further evidence for this was provided by involve ment in the Boxer rebellion in China. Not only did the colonial governments agree to an Admiralty request for the deployment of ships from the Aus tralian and Auxiliary Squadrons to Chinese waters, but Victoria, South Aus tralia and New South Wales sent naval brigades and a colonial warship to join the international Field Force for the relief of the Peking legations. As in the Sudan earlier, the colonials arrived too late to see much real action, but the ‘bluejackets’ stayed on in various non-combatant roles until April 1901. 
What is often overlooked by those who lament the readiness to volunteer which Australians allegedly displayed is the lack of willingness of Australians (and Canadians for that matter) to become part of an imperial federation or to surrender totally the control of such forces as they possessed to the metropolitan power. The restrictions placed upon the Auxiliary Squadron demonstrated this, as did the provisions of the first federal Defence Act

which restricted the forces to service in Australian territory and which itself was a direct descendant of similar provisions in colonial legislation. The later refusal of the Commonwealth to place Australian soldiers under the capital courts martial system of the British Army Act likewise was a direct consequence of earlier colonial legislation (and owed little if anything to the execution of Morant and Handcock). And the moves at the 1902 Colo nial Conference to form an imperial military reserve, supported by the New Zealand Prime Minister, Richard Seddon, in the hope of translating the mil itary support fielded in South Africa into a permanent scheme, foundered upon the nationalist content of the imperial sentiment in Australia and Canada which Seddon and others sought to harness.
