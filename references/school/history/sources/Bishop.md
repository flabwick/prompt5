Women on the move 
Gender, money-making and mobility in  mid-nineteenth-century Australasia 
Catherine Bishop 
Both onward mobility and money-making in the middle of the nineteenth  century have typically been regarded as male prerogatives. Transnational  mobility has been the subject of much recent scholarship, but the focus has  been primarily on elite travellers, ‘imperial careers’ and the movement of  ideas around the webs of empire. Scholars have acknowledged that women  emigrated, but as domestic servants, governesses or wives. Particularly  once married with children, these women are assumed to have settled in  one place. This article challenges the notion that women were less mobile  than men. Women in business not only demonstrated an awareness of  markets beyond the local, but used their ability to make money in order to  move around. Their motives ranged from the pursuit of profit and joining  (or escaping) family, to avoiding scandal. For some, that mobility was  a lifelong habit while for others, it was part of their business plan. This  article considers the connections between business, mobility and gender in  Australasian cities in the middle of the nineteenth century.

‘Husbands do and go, wives wait and cope.’1 This telling title of a book chapter  about nineteenth-century New Zealand women epitomises the role in which  colonial women in settler societies have been depicted. While the geographical  mobility of people around the globe in pursuit of economic opportunities  in the nineteenth century has been widely recognised, it has been seen as  primarily led and undertaken by men. Seldom are women shown as more  than followers and even less often as money-makers in their own right. This  article considers the intersection between business, geographical mobility  and gender in Australasian cities in the mid-nineteenth century. It highlights  ways in which colonial businesswomen, just like businessmen, developed  money-making strategies that reflected an awareness of markets beyond the  local, and were also sometimes onwardly mobile. Onwardly mobile women  were those who did not settle in one place after their initial migration but

moved on to other towns or colonies. Importantly, their ability to run a  business was vital to that movement – either business enabled movement  or mobility was an integral part of a business strategy. This article focuses  on emerging Australasian cities, particularly Wellington and Sydney, but  has wider implications for literature on mobility and transnationalism.  Several of these women’s travels and connections stretched across the  empire and beyond. I define ‘businesswoman’ broadly – any woman who  was self-employed, on however small a scale. 
Nineteenth-century geographical mobility has been the subject of much  recent scholarship. New Zealand and Australian towns and cities might  have been several days’ sailing from each other and half a world away in  physical distance from London, but they were part of empire-wide networks  of ideas and people. Migrants were conscious of the ‘tyranny of distance’2 yet connected across it, increasingly swiftly as the century progressed,  with the development of communication and transport technology.3 These  networks have been identified by scholars such as Alan Lester, who writes  of ‘communicative circuits’ of empire within the context of developing ideas  about race. Tony Ballantyne has emphasised ‘webs of empire’, unsettling  the binary of metropole and periphery in our understanding of mobility  and colonial enterprise, and allowing consideration of broader ranges of  movement among disparate colonial and international sites.4 
Much attention has been paid to the elite globe trotters, the movers  and shakers of empire; men such as Sir George Grey, who was successively  governor of South Australia, New Zealand and the Cape Colony.5 His life  exemplified the physical and ideological links between colonial states, as  officials moved around from post to post, with experiences in one colony

informing and being informed by their activities in another.6 Collections,  such as those edited by Desley Deacon, Angela Woollacott and Penny  Russell, have highlighted these important ‘transnational lives’, including  those of wealthy private travellers, women as well as men.7 Because  these people were influential and articulate, often writing about their  experiences, and were well connected to the metropole, they shaped public  colonial policy, society and culture. 
Further down the social scale people also criss-crossed the globe, al though their experiences beyond their initial migration have been less  well documented. In addition, studies of transnational migration and  onward mobility have tended to focus on the male experience.8 The  growing numbers of deserted wives attests to the freedom of men to  move about without encumbrance. Women have been depicted as more  settled, ‘waiting and coping’, especially once married with children. Yet  women were mobile, even when moving within a family group, a wife’s  ability to make money through business could be as significant as her  husband’s in facilitating mobility. 
Female emigrants have been discussed as wives and mothers  accompanying husbands and children to the colonies, as domestic ser vants or as governesses, but seldom as entrepreneurs.9 Scholarship about

Women on the move 
women’s work has tended to focus on female employment rather than  female self-employment.10 The Victorian ideology of domesticity placed  women in the private sphere, with responsibility for home and family.  Yet businesswomen running small (though often long-lived) commercial  enterprises were a visible and important part of the urban scene in both  New Zealand and Australia in the mid-nineteenth century.11 
Many of these women did not settle in one place but moved about:  between towns, colonies, countries and hemispheres. The rare examples  of historical research on female onward mobility have not generally  been concerned with the mid-nineteenth century. Kit Candlin’s ground 
breaking research on free, coloured women who moved about the  Caribbean discusses money-making and mobility in the late eighteenth  and early nineteenth centuries.12 The work of Lyndon Fraser and  Angela McCarthy on the women of the West Coast goldfields of New  Zealand also suggests that women moved on in the latter years of the  nineteenth century.13 I have been particularly influenced by Desley  Deacon’s discussion of the ‘mind maps’ of theatrical performers, male  and female, whose ‘geographies of the mind’ situated Australian cities  within a network of international ports. She shows that these women  and men saw themselves as inhabiting a world unconstrained by national  or colonial borders – they were transnational citizens, following mind

maps constructed along shipping routes connecting port towns, around  gold rushes and centred on theatrical and family connections.14 I would  add another mind map – that of business – for it was these performers’  commercial lives as theatrical performers that also governed their  patterns of movement. 
My research focuses on Sydney in New South Wales and Wellington  in New Zealand between about 1830 and 1870. During this period  Sydney grew rapidly, with accompanying developing infrastructure and  transport networks that meant moving around became easier. By 1850  Sydney was a 60-year-old metropolis with a growing population of around  50,000; by 1870 this population had more than doubled. Wellington, on  the other hand, was barely 10 years old in 1850, more a town than a city,  with about 5000 people, but important as a fledgling commercial port  and service centre for bush-battling settlers in the hinterland. Sydney  and Melbourne, along with London, served as metropoles for New  Zealand towns. Yet, in spite of their size, neither Sydney nor Melbourne  was greatly industrialised, with manufacturing primarily taking place  in small workshops. As in Wellington, shops were still small and family run, with the exception of a few large draperies that would develop into  well-known department stores later in the century. More importantly,  shops and workshops were also often homes; domestic and business lives  were co-located, meaning that women, especially married women with  children, could be engaged in commercial enterprise. Thus a walk down  Willis Street in Wellington or Pitt Street in Sydney in the 1850s could  involve meeting scores of women engaged in selling fruit or tobacco,  making bonnets or dresses, running pubs or boarding houses, teaching  school or doing laundry, among any number of other money-making  activities. These women were not just widows or spinsters having to  make do without the support of a breadwinning male but also married  women, including those with young children.15 
The conclusions I reach in this article come from assembling evidence  from a wide variety of sources, most notably the newly available  digitised newspapers, enabling businesswomen to be traced across time

and space.16 The evidence for mobility is piecemeal, the result of noticing  individual women appearing and reappearing in different locations, and  there is a degree of serendipity involved. The onwardly mobile women  uncovered so far number in scores rather than hundreds or thousands  but their presence suggests that for a good number of women, making a  living was inextricably linked to the nature and extent of their mobility. 
Connections across empire 
Colonial settlers’ awareness of and connections with the wider world can  be seen in the material things with which they surrounded themselves.  Their ‘mind maps’ of belonging stretched far beyond the local. Colonial  women played pianos imported from London and wore cloth made in  Manchester from cotton grown throughout the empire and beyond it.  They drank tea from Ceylon and used spices from India. They read books  published in England and the United States and grew plants that reminded  them of their homes.17 The American whaler Daniel Dougherty’s Irish born wife Sarah grew lemon-scented geraniums, lavender and strawberry  plants in her New Zealand garden from seedlings carried carefully  from Canada, where her parents lived and where she had grown up. Her  possessions also included treasured dresses bought in New Orleans,  where her husband’s parents resided.18 
In the 1850s Mary Taylor, a New Zealand shopkeeper and friend of  Charlotte Brontë, famously wrote of ‘the queer feeling of living as I do  in 2 places at once’, thereby articulating the feelings of many migrants  whose ideas were shaped by events and conversations across networks

These are a useful counterpoint to ships’ passenger lists,  which usually listed wives without occupation and recorded female bounty immigrants  as domestic servants. Margaret Potbury, for instance, a trained milliner, was listed as a  domestic servant on the John Gray in 1852. See Bishop, ‘Commerce Was a Woman’, 4.

of empire.19 These connections were evident on a personal level through  letters but more publicly in the press. With newspapers given free passage  throughout the empire from the mid-1830s, local editors in colonial  towns reprinted articles from as far afield as Calcutta and Cape Town, and  included commentary about places as varied as Valparaiso and London.  As Alan Lester has suggested, ‘the gaze of the early nineteenth century  British settler press ... was by no means parochial’.20 
An awareness of a wider world was demonstrated in commerce, as  economic information circulated around the empire. Prices in Wellington  markets were reported in Sydney newspapers and vice versa.21 The way  goods traversed busy shipping routes between the old world and new  as well as between imperial sites is well known. Large importing and  exporting companies run by men conducted global businesses. Small  business owners, including women, also had a sense of a wider colonial  world and appreciated its interconnectedness and opportunities. This  could be by trading goods between metropole and periphery, by advertis ing outside their immediate area, or by moving on to take advantage of a  new market in a different town or colony. Many shopkeeping immigrants  arrived with cargo to sell to a colonial market desperate for the latest  European goods. They often asked friends to send further supplies.  The many advertisements in colonial newspapers emphasising the  arrival of the latest Parisian and London fashions illustrated how canny  businesswomen exploited their market. Their customers might have been  trailing their hems through muddy, half-formed streets 12,000 miles  from Chelsea, but they were nevertheless determined to be part of a  European world. Mary Taylor in Wellington, for example, marketed goods  sent by English friends by explaining that those friends were wearing  similar items.22 
Some businesswomen had no choice but to engage constantly with the  outside world since their customers came from elsewhere. Boarding house

keepers catered for travellers as well as recently arrived immigrants,  marketing their services accordingly. Mrs Byers of Sydney advertised  her Jamison Street boarding house in Wellington newspapers in New  Zealand in 1858.23 Mrs Winch advertised her Auckland establishment  in the Taranaki Herald in New Plymouth and the Nelson Examiner in the  South Island in the 1850s.24 Boarding house keepers were particularly  aware of the ease of colonial mobility; especially so when their erstwhile  lodgers departed without paying their debts.25 
One would expect dressmakers, teachers and small shopkeepers to  have catered for customers within their local towns. But this was not  necessarily so. Elizabeth George was in the transport business. She ran  a store and hotel in Onehunga near Auckland and advertised her ability  to transport cargo from Auckland to the port at Onehunga. She placed  her advertisements in Nelson newspapers as well as locally in the 1850s  and 1860s.26 Other businesswomen exploited the status of Wellington  and Auckland as metropoles for smaller New Zealand settlements. In  1864 Eliza Wrigley, ‘milliner of Wellington’, took a selection of millinery  to Napier seeking customers.27 Also advertised in Napier in 1864 was  the Auckland-based servants’ registry office of Josephine Venables.28 Schools, especially those seeking boarders, promoted themselves widely.  Mrs Askin’s Wellington school was advertised in Napier and Nelson in  1858. Across the Tasman, the Cooksey sisters at Carthona in Sydney  advertised as far north as Brisbane.29 Particularly entrepreneurial was  ‘Madame Carole’, ‘Clairvoyante Physician’, whose business was based in

Collins Street in Melbourne. She advertised in the Wellington Independent in New Zealand in 1861, offering remote diagnoses for the fee of £1.30 Few businesses run by women (or men for that matter) had branches  in more than one city in the middle of the century. One exception was  Madame Sohier’s waxworks, which had branches in Sydney and Melbourne  from 1859, her displays including international criminals, royalty and  local celebrities such as the explorers, Burke and Wills. Madame Sohier,  a waxwork artist, travelled the world with her husband collecting new  exhibits, including live performers and ‘freaks’, exploiting the public’s  taste for the exotic. She was well aware that her customers’ frames of  reference included Europe, North America and the British Empire as well  as Australasia.31 Sohier’s waxworks, like Mary Taylor’s European bonnets  and the transcolonial advertisements of ‘Madame Carole’, exemplified  the ways in which women, like men, forged and maintained connections  across disparate locations. 
Motivations for mobility 
Why did women move? Colonisation, as Nan Seuffert notes, was predicated  on mobility – but purposeful mobility with the aim of settlement, rather  than aimless wandering. The lure of potential land ownership was a major  motivation for many settlers.32 But it was rare for women to take up land,  unless they were widows with grown sons. Independent women tended to  be found in towns. For instance, spinster Elizabeth Willcox, who arrived  in New Zealand in 1853 with three brothers and a married sister, ran  a Wellington drapery store for many years, while her siblings took up  land and moved north.33 City-dwellers involved in commerce were not as  tied to the land as rural settlers. Their means of money-making were far  more portable. It is significant that around half of the nearly 80 families  who arrived in Wellington on the London in 1842 did not settle there  permanently. They scattered throughout New Zealand and Australia.34

Women on the move 
So with portable skills and without land ownership tying them down,  why did women move on? Their motivations fall within six main categories:  pursuit of profit, joining family, a life pattern, escaping family, as part of a  business strategy and escaping scandal. 
Pursuing profit 
Some were galvanised by the thought of profits. Generally, this motivation  is attributed to men – for example, goldminers who chased the elusive  fortune-making nugget; or the more savvy, who established stores and  hotels on the goldfields. Nineteenth-century women have seldom been  credited with mercenary motivation or initiative, or with having visions  beyond the domestic. Similarly, the image of the black sheep of the family  avoiding financial embarrassment at home through emigration or onward  movement is male. And while insolvency or financial disaster has not in  fact been evident as a factor in female mobility, the pursuit of profit has  been. As Jan Gothard and Jim Hammerton both emphasised, migrating  domestic servants were not just husband hunters; ‘their goals were much  closer to those of men – focusing on employment and self-improvement’.35 Women could be as active as men in seeking their fortunes. As Margaret  Anderson noted, Sarah Davenport and Lucy Hart insisted their husbands  try the Victorian goldfields; Davenport, like many other women, was  a working partner in the enterprise, washing gold and discovering a  profitable claim. Other women took advantage of higher wages offered to  servants and barmaids at the diggings, turning down other employment  opportunities in order to pursue their goals.36 These women were not in  business but their consciousness of money to be made suggests this was  not an entirely male exercise. And we must not forget women such as  Ellen Clacy, whose life on the goldfields was essentially a domestic one; ‘a  lady’s visit to the gold diggings’, as she called it. She nevertheless had the  entrepreneurial nous to publish her story upon her return to England,  cleverly exploiting her mobility for money-making purposes.37

Joining family 
In addition to profits, family connections were primary mobility  motivators, for both men and women. In 1981, A. Gordon Darroch em phasised the importance of kinship networks in patterns of migration  in nineteenth-century North America and Europe. In contrast to Miles  Fairburn’s later argument about New Zealand, Darroch rejected the idea  that nineteenth-century mobility was ‘largely rootless, individualistic  wandering’.38 Desley Deacon has also written of the importance of ‘the  map of family in the theatrical world’ and ‘the thickness of the “tender  ties”’ between the many individuals. With few theatrical performers  able to settle in one place permanently, the significance of family  connections was heightened.39 But these ‘tender ties’ of family were not  restricted to the theatre. Raewyn Dalziel has shown the importance of  serial family migration in 1840s New Plymouth in New Zealand, and  recent technological advances have made researching these familial  connections much easier, showing that New Plymouth was by no means  an isolated case.40 
Moving to join family members or as part of a family group was made  possible by an ability to make money. And women’s businesses were  just as important in enabling families to move. George Triggs’ various  migrations would have been difficult without his wife Harriet’s millinery  business. With their four children, they migrated initially to Nelson  in 1842 from London, where Harriet had her own business off Oxford  Street. By September 1843 they were en route to Sydney, where Harriet  Triggs once again established a dressmaking business to support the  family. George, meanwhile, struggled to establish his own enterprise.41 
Migrating family groups typically included a man, with the accom panying assumption that the dominant, motivating force for migration  was that man. Research shows that not only is the assumption of male  dominance unfounded, but that all-female family groups also migrated.  Under-studied by historians, many of these included women in business.

Women on the move 
Sometimes they were moving to join relatives – like the Cooksey sisters,  who left their long-standing school in Worcestershire to join their widowed  sister and her son in Sydney, where they opened another long-lived school.  In other cases motivations are less clear. Phillis Sloman migrated initially  to Cape Town with her husband and small children in 1820. More than 30  years later, having been widowed and leaving several grown-up children in  that city, she migrated with some of her daughters to Sydney, where they  established a dressmaking business. Both Sloman’s decision to move and  her choice of destination are unfathomable, particularly as she had been  in business herself in South Africa since the 1830s, ‘importing and selling  women’s finery and holding a respectable position amongst the merchants  of Capetown’. She appeared to have no family in Sydney, although perhaps  she had wider links within the Jewish community.42 
A life pattern 
For many immigrants, like Phillis Sloman, the journey to the Australasian  colonies was not their first migration. They had elsewhere already moved  from country to town, or within Europe.43 Some women began migrating  as children, accompanying their families halfway around the world  and setting a pattern for their future lives. Josephine Liardet was one  example. She crossed the world three times as a child and accompanied  her first husband, Captain John Venables, to China from Melbourne in  1854. Upon their return, Captain Venables disappeared, possibly into  an asylum, where he died. His wife opened a servants’ registry office  in St Kilda in 1859 and was soon advertising dressmaking and sewing  machine lessons.44 
Josephine Venables moved to Auckland, New Zealand in 1864, opened a  registry office and advertised as far afield as Napier. She was in business in  Wellington with her equally mobile parents in 1866, and, after marrying  John Macdonald, she moved to the West Coast, again in business. In  spite of being fined for assaulting the illegitimate daughter and mistress  of her new husband in 1867, she appeared to retain her respectability as

she continued in business there for six more years. By 1879 she had  reinvented herself again as a surgical belt maker, living in Wellington.  Her husband was a ‘settler’ in the 1884 Post Office Directory, while his  wife was listed with her profession, perhaps indicating that she was  the family breadwinner. She travelled around the North Island, signing  the suffrage petition in Wanganui in 1893, and remained in business  until 1901, retiring aged 70, ‘well-known throughout New Zealand’.45 Josephine Liardet/Venables/Macdonald was a veritable rolling stone, her  mobility facilitated by her ability to support herself and her family as she  seized every business opportunity. 
When Venables accompanied her seafaring husband to China in 1854  she was following the example of many mariners’ wives. They went  with their husbands to ports throughout the world and many found  themselves surviving alone in a port town while their husbands made  trips without them. It is no surprise to find mariners’ wives featuring  strongly among women in business in colonial port towns and as serial  migrants. Augusta, wife of Captain Herbert Ellis Danvers, accompanied  her husband to Australasia in 1864 with one child, giving birth to a  second on board ship in port at Christchurch. In September 1865 she  was advertising a young ladies’ school in Napier and by July 1866 had  travelled independently with her two children to Nelson, where she  established another school. By 1871 Danvers was in England, where she  and four children were living spread amongst several relatives while her  husband remained at sea.46 
Escaping family 
Danvers’ later choices of residence indicate that living apart from her  husband was an option for enterprising women. Escaping personal  crises or unfortunate marital decisions motivated both men’s and  women’s mobility. Deserted wives were a well-recognised phenomenon;  contemporary observers expressed concern and later historians have

documented their plight.47 Dr Robert Porter Welch tried to use his mo bility as a ship’s surgeon to escape his marriage to Helen Uther in the  1840s but she determinedly accompanied him with their children. As  he complained to his brother several years later, ‘In 1841 I married in  Sydney, but the marriage was an unfortunate one and the source of many  a trouble since, for in travelling about to avoid it I took it with me’.48 
In the end it was Helen who made her escape after the family moved  to Wellington in the 1850s. She opened a school there with her daughter  when her husband relocated to the Wairarapa with their son. Over the  next decades she moved between Napier, Wellington, Hamilton and  Auckland, giving music lessons and running girls’ schools to support  herself. Her daughter assisted her and then became a teacher in her own  right; Helen Welch later moved to live near her then married daughter.49 Welch was both respectable and respected, in spite of living apart from  her husband, her standing almost certainly being tied to having a  successful business. 
Welch’s decision to live separately from her husband would not have  been taken lightly. In 1826 her mother had made a similar decision,  leaving her husband Reuben Uther in Sydney and moving to Tasmania.  She drowned three years later, having, according to popular report,  ‘pursu[ed] a life of infamy, depravity and guilt’.50 Welch, on the other  hand, made sure she was able to support herself through her own  enterprise before making her escape. She was one of many women for  whom running a business was a means to flee an unfortunate marriage.51 
Even more mobile was Rosa Scholey. Born and married in Jamaica, she  moved first with her husband to London, where she appears to have left

him in a workhouse in Islington in 1855. She migrated alone to Sydney,  where she ran several different businesses to support herself.52 
Business strategy 
For some women, mobility was itself an integral part of their business  strategy. They used their mobility to further their business interests,  exploiting any opportunity. So when Hannah Baker of Nelson travelled  back to England in 1857 for a year, she not only purchased stock for  the family shop but, before she left Nelson, offered to ‘take charge of  any commissions entrusted to her care’ and advised that she was ‘a  purchaser of silver plate and New Zealand curiosities for cash’. (Her  entrepreneurialism was not limited to business – she found a 30-year-old  husband for her 15-year-old daughter on the homeward-bound ship.)53 
Mobility was also essential for theatrical entrepreneurs. Their lives  revolved around well-worn transnational theatrical circuits. Some women  – ‘stars’ – moved around independently, condescending to grace the stage  in a multitude of towns and cities throughout the empire and beyond.  Others ran their own companies. Mrs W. H. Foley’s company was well  known throughout New Zealand as well as in Sydney in the 1850s and  1860s. She began life as Catherine Huggins, the daughter of travelling  actors in England. She married Daniel Caparn, father of her child, in  1845. In 1847 they migrated to Tasmania, where Mrs Caparn established  a millinery business. But in 1849 Caparn left her husband and child and  went to San Francisco. Reinventing herself as an actress, she married  theatrical entrepreneur W. H. Foley just after Daniel Caparn’s death. 
Catherine Foley returned to the Australasian colonies, although not to  Tasmania or her child, and made her Australian debut in Sydney in 1854.  She later toured New Zealand. Having already abandoned one husband  and child she then left another in 1858. While W. H. Foley took up with the  company’s bareback rider, his wife established her own theatrical troupe,  in all likelihood leaving her latest baby with her husband and his new

partner. ‘Mrs W. H. Foley’ and her new ‘leading man’ toured New Zealand,  South America and England, where they married in 1882, although W. H.  Foley was alive in Christchurch.54 Foley’s choice of profession as theatrical  entrepreneur required that she be mobile, which in her case was possibly  just as well, given her unorthodox domestic arrangements. 
Madame Lee, who began in 1857 what became Madame Sohier’s  Waxworks, was another woman for whom mobility was integral to  business. She was a tightrope walker, dancer and clairvoyant. With her  troupe of ‘Petite Lees’, she performed in circuses and on the stage in  Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart and Adelaide between 1853 and 1863 as well  as opening the waxworks exhibition, giving dancing lessons and taking  the lease on a theatre in Beechworth, Victoria. She was clearly unafraid  of diversification. Two of her daughters died in Calcutta in the 1870s  and their deaths were reported in New Zealand newspapers, suggesting  that Madame Lee’s transcolonial wanderings had reached beyond the  Australian continent.55 
It was not only theatrical performers who exploited their mobility  for financial gain. Being able to flit between colonial towns gave one an  edge in business terms. This was used to good advantage in the 1860s by  Blessington Flood, the entrepreneurial wife of a tailor, who himself had  a tendency to insolvency. Arriving in Nelson in 1866 Flood immediately  recognised a business opportunity. She established a ‘labour mart’,  proposing to provide local clients with domestic servants from Sydney  and Melbourne. Flood cited experience ‘in the Registry Offices of both  Sydney and Adelaide’, although no record of her can be found in either  city. She sensibly advertised that she had the support of the local  provincial secretary. Having commanded sufficient local interest, Mrs  Flood returned to Sydney and invited prospective servants to apply to  her ‘Registry Office’ at the White Hart Hotel in George Street. Flood was  unusual in providing a transnational servants’ registry office service, and  was perhaps following the example of Caroline Chisholm, who imported

servants on a much larger scale from England to Australia in the 1840s  and 1850s, as part of her broader program of emigration reform.56 But Flood’s entrepreneurialism did not end there. Her wax flowers were  much admired in 1867 by the Nelson Evening Mail, which commented  that it was an art ‘not extensively practised by the lady members of this  community’. Flood immediately began to offer lessons, although a later  court case suggested that her prices were ‘exorbitant’.57 In addition, while  in Sydney in December 1866 gathering prospective servants, she offered  her information services to ‘Miners, Speculators, and others intending to  proceed to New Zealand’. She had, she claimed, ‘visited nearly the whole  of the Provinces and all the principal Diggings of New Zealand’ and had  ‘twelve years’ experience in Victoria and New South Wales’. Needless to  say there is no evidence of her having done so and it is not clear whether  anyone availed themselves of her ‘expertise’. The Floods moved to Sydney  in 1868 after Charles Flood became insolvent in Nelson. Blessington  Flood diversified again and started a ‘Clothing Club for Females’ in Pitt  Street in 1870.58 
Blessington Flood might have exaggerated her qualifications but it was  not unusual to claim past experience in a far-off town. That meant Paris or  London if you were in Sydney but in Wellington, Sydney and Melbourne  had prestige, while from Napier, Auckland or Wellington could seem  glamorous. Bluff and bluster were accepted and acceptable so long as  one’s products lived up to expectation. Thus milliners and dressmakers  emphasised ‘London’ and, even more precisely, ‘Regent Street’ expertise,  even though such claims were often fictional. The dressmaking Tanner  sisters, for instance, announced to Sydney in 1855 that they were ‘of  London’, although they actually hailed from Bristol.59 Those who moved  around had even more opportunity to stretch the truth.

Women on the move 
Escaping scandal 
Stretching the truth and regular mobility were integral parts of the  business strategy of Cora Anna Weekes, whose transnational travels  stretched from England, Texas and California to Sydney, Melbourne and  Calcutta. Weekes was a superb conwoman, who used her feminine charm  and articulate plausibility to dupe creditors around the globe. She would  establish ‘literary’ magazines and collect subscriptions, publishing a few  issues before slipping away on a ship under an assumed name to her next  destination. Barely one step ahead of the stories that followed her from  town to town, Weekes nevertheless managed to stay for several months  in Sydney after she was unmasked, even being invited to give a lecture  at the Sydney School of Arts, an unusual honour for a woman in 1858.60 
Described as ‘interesting, lovely and intellectual’, she seemed irresistible  to colonial Sydney: ‘Her bright, expressive eyes, petite yet graceful form  and air, soft sympathetic voice and look of trusting confiding dependence  took the gentlemen by storm’.61 Her ability to move (quickly) from one  city to another was vital to her business project. It is conceivable that she  finally eluded her past in Calcutta, where she arrived in 1859, as she then  disappears from the records entirely. 
Cora Anna Weekes was a scandalous woman. The way in which scandal  followed swiftly along the shipping lanes on the heels of colonial elite  travellers in the early nineteenth century has been well documented by  Kirsten McKenzie.62 By moving our gaze further down the social scale  and out of the limelight, however, we find that reinvention was possible,  and escaping scandal was one motivation for moving on. 
For some, emigration itself was an escape. Serial migrant Eliza Tighe,  matron on the Victory, arrived in Sydney in 1855. Originally from Ireland,  she was a governess for aristocracy in provincial England before moving  to London. While this move might have been economically motivated,  her migration to Sydney was clearly an escape, for she left behind a one 
month-old, illegitimate daughter in the care of neighbours in London.  In adulthood the daughter emigrated to Canada, where descendants  tell stories of a lost mother in Woolloomooloo. Tighe was later joined in

Sydney by her brother and nephews and she ran a grocery store and then,  having married, a school, her murky past safely put behind her.63 Other women reinvented themselves through onward migration. Emi nently respectable Wellingtonian Sarah Masters had a well-patronised  straw-bonnetmaking business in the 1840s, sharing premises with her  husband, a cooper. Joseph Masters was politically active and later a  pioneer settler of the Wairarapa, where the town of Masterton is named  after him. He epitomised the successful working-class immigrant. But Sarah Masters’ veneer of respectability hid a scandal of potentially  damaging proportions to her husband’s nascent political career. The  Masters had arrived in Wellington in 1842 from Hobart, where in 1835  Sarah Masters had appeared before the Supreme Court charged with  murdering her new-born baby. The details of the case were titillating, so  much so that the Hobart Town Courier declared it ‘not of a nature to lay  before our readers; though it excited intense interest among numerous  auditory’. Fortunately the Colonial Times had no such scruples and told  the story in full – of a suspiciously dark-skinned baby, an absent husband  and an apparently tearful confession by Sarah Masters to a midwife of an  extramarital affair with a non-European man followed by the murder of  the child.64 
Masters was acquitted and this story did not even make it to the  newspapers in Sydney or Melbourne in spite of its obvious scandalous  appeal. It was certainly forgotten by the time the Masters arrived in  Wellington. Their successful remaking of themselves (Joseph Masters  also had difficulties with various individuals in Hobart, although not on  quite the same scale as his wife) illustrates the opportunities available  through onward migration to those with the determination to leave  their past behind them.65 Theatrical performers appear to have had

different standards applied to their behaviour. Mr and Mrs W. H. Foley’s  dysfunctional marriage received no media attention although they were  touring New Zealand separately at the same time. Mrs Foley featured  in the New Zealand press judged solely for her success on stage and as  a theatrical entrepreneur. Indeed, her first name and entire personal  history, including the child desertion and bigamy, was entirely unknown  until recently.66 
As the century progressed, escaping scandal became more difficult,  ironically as mobility became easier. With news travelling even more  swiftly between ports and with more people on the move, all travelling  similar well-worn circuits, anonymous reinvention became harder. Harriet  Corston, a dressmaker, travelled about New Zealand from Auckland  to Thames and the West Coast, both with and without her husband. As  Peter Corston put it, when his ‘affairs became somewhat involved, they  travelled to various parts of New Zealand. They sometimes lived together  and at other times they remained apart, owing to his having to seek  employment’.67 
Peter Corston eventually disappeared to Melbourne and a few years  later Harriet Corston moved to Sydney and married again, only to  find herself splashed across newspapers throughout New Zealand and  Australia in 1889 when she was on trial for bigamy. Having lived in  Auckland, Thames and on the West Coast as well as Sydney meant that  her story was interesting to people across a wide area. 
Harriet Corston’s defence in her bigamy trial revealed much about the  importance of business in providing a measure female independence.  She said that ‘there was no necessity for her to marry [again as] she was  in a position to make her own living’.68 Corston might not have escaped  scandal but she did manage to run boarding houses in Sydney and in  the Blue Mountains for the next 15 years. She retired to Auckland still  owning property in Thames.69 So perhaps it could be said that even  Corston managed to outrun her notoriety.

Conclusion 
There were many reasons to move on but an ability to make a living was  essential to the success of mobility. My research has uncovered numbers  of mobile women at a time when mobility has been typically gendered  male. This depiction by historians has been influenced by contemporary  observers, who did not necessarily see either women in business, or  women on the move. These observers tended to comment on what was  unusual about a new place rather than on the familiar and they failed  to acknowledge these women because they were ordinary rather than  extraordinary. This very ordinariness has rendered many women invisible  in history, despite their being prominent enough at the time.70 
Rather than being mere followers of their male breadwinning relatives,  women used business ability to facilitate their movement between  colonial spaces. For some, mobility and business were intertwined, a con sciousness of the wider colonial world informing their business decisions.  Others used their business ability in order to move on, or exploited  mobility as part of a business strategy. Although the connection between  women’s businesses and their mobility is shown here primarily within  an Australasian context, their movement was not limited to Antipodean  cities. This suggests that we are dealing with a broader phenomenon, one  that deserves further investigation by international scholars. 
The study of these women’s mobility exposes a complicated picture of  the ways in which the nineteenth-century world worked – particularly  in relation to the masculinity of the imperial project. I have suggested  that although women had often been shown as ‘helpmeets’ in historical  accounts, many in fact assumed more active commercial roles, and their  enterprise and capacity to move were significant. While the influence of  upper-class women in the British Empire has been well documented, this  research shifts the focus further down the social scale.71 Businesswomen  were essential to the development of colonial societies, and their mobility  suggests broader spheres of influence than the local, extending beyond  the British Empire to the United States and Europe. We need to reassess  our understanding of women’s position in, and contribution to, colonial  economies – of the connections between gender, mobility and money making – and recognise that women too were mobile, connected and active  agents in a wider world than that of home and family.
