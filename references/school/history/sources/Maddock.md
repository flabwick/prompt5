 Supply-Side Shocks: The Case of  Australian Gold 
 RODNEY MADDOCK AND IAN MCLEAN 
 A literature has developed recently to analyze the disruptive effects on small,  open economies of a sudden change in the value of their natural resources. The  paper looks to that literature to explain the effect on the Australian colonies of the  discovery of substantial gold deposits in the 1850s. The price and quantity  adjustments predicted by the model are found to be well supported by the  historical experience with one important exception. Immigration played a far  greater role in the Australian case than has been suggested in the theoretical  literature. The model does, however, allow for a compact description of the  confusing decade in Australian history and explains a number of previously  unconnected phenomena. 
 MODELING SUPPLY SHOCKS 
 GOLD was discovered in 1851 in two of Britain's Australian colo-  nies-New South Wales and Victoria.' The population of Australia  almost trebled in the following ten years to 1.1 million, and the two  colonies in which gold was found experienced a dramatic jump in the  value of their exports, from ?2.4 million in 1850 to ?15.6 million three  years later (Table 1). One consequence of an export revenue shock of  this magnitude was widespread dislocation of industry and society-  "we all wear imported boots and shoes and it is cheaper to buy new than  to get old mended." 
 While "windfall" gains of this size are rare, a number of historical  parallels exist-gold in California is an obvious one.2 Here we take our  inspiration from more recent events. The sudden oil price rise in the  early 1970s led to substantial increases in the export revenues of some

 Sources: Population: The total population for Victoria and Australia, at 31 December, was  obtained from the Australian Demography Bulletin (1949), p. 154. Annual percentage  change is from all sources in the total Australian population. 
 Migration: The recorded migration figures for the Australian colonies during the period  are incomplete, particularly regarding the netting-out of intercolonial movements other  than by sea. The estimates have been obtained by applying the 1860-1869 average rate of  natural increase (2.4 percent) to the mean of the total population figures for adjacent years  from "Australia" above, then taking the resulting estimate of the natural increase in the  population away from the recorded total increase. This gives a residual estimate of the net  apparent immigration each calendar year. Assisted migration figures are derived from  Statistical Registers for the various colonies. 
 External Trade: The estimates are obtained from the Statistical Registers of New South  Wales and Victoria. The figures are known to be defective in the recording of overland  trade between the two colonies. The export data include re-exports, as the subdivision of  Victorian exports into "own produce" and "re-exports" was not made until 1858.

 adjustment and thus on the real rather than the nominal effects of a  shock.4 They have slightly different forms for fixed and for flexible  exchange rates, but the fixed regime is appropriate to our case. The  literature notionally divides the economy into three industries, two of  which produce tradables (whose prices are fixed on the world market  and given to the economy in question) and one which produces a  nontradable (the price of which is flexible with respect to the other two).  The boom occurs in one of the tradable sectors. The returns to factors  employed in that industry rise so that mobile factors of production flow  into it, forcing up the prices that the other industries have to pay for  their inputs. Because the price of the other tradable is fixed on the world  market it suffers a price-cost squeeze and contracts. If it is called  "manufacturing" the process might be termed deindustrialization. On  the other hand, prices in the nontradable or service sector are free to  rise, allowing it to compete for factors. These sectoral consequences  resulting from flows of factors into the booming sector have been  labeled by Corden and Neary (1982) the resource movement effect. In  addition the boom increases incomes and hence the overall demand for  goods and services. The non-booming (hereafter "lagging") tradable  sector receives few benefits from the boom, because the increased  demands for its products represent only a small increase in world  demand (by the definition of a small economy), which is where its price  is determined. On the other hand the spending effect should increase  significantly the demand for nontradables. If the economy consisted  simply of three industries producing gold (the booming sector), wool  (the lagging sector), and services (the nontradables), a gold boom would  squeeze the wool industry. Its effect on services would be ambiguous,  tending to increase demand through the spending effect and to increase  costs through the resource movement effect. 
 One interesting feature of the gold era in Australia was the interna-  tional movement of labor-the rushes were not simply to the gold fields  from other Australian colonies but into the colonies from other parts of  the world (see Table 1). In its usual form the supply shock model is  driven by intersectoral mobility of labor (and capital), but the effect of  international mobility of labor has been discussed fleetingly if at all. 
 4 Discussion of some monetary effects of the Australian gold discoveries is to be found in S. J.  Butlin, "The South Australian Devaluation of 1852," Business Archives and History, 8 (Aug.  1963), 156-86; and in R. F. Holder, Bank of New South Wales: A History, 2 vols. (Sydney, 1970).  Our focus is on structural change, hence, the real effects. J. E. Cairnes (Essays in Political  Economy, pp. 1-165) produces an early account of the whole period that emphasizes the monetary  aspects; and A. R. Hall ("Capital Imports and the Composition of Investment in a Borrowing  Country" in The Export of Capitalfrom Britain, 1870-1940, ed. A. R. Hall [London, 1968]) uses a  related model to consider capital inflows in late nineteenth-century Australian economic history. C.  D. Goodwin, "British Economists and Australian Gold," this JOURNAL, 30 (June 1970), 405-26,  discusses contemporary fears of a dislocation in the British economy, though without employing  any formal model.

 That many of the effects of gold discoveries in Australia expressed  themselves as a population increase has, as we shall see, important  consequences for understanding its long-run benefits. 
 In short, the paper sets out to answer one question about Australian  economic history and one about economic theory. What was the  process of adjustment of the economy to the shock of the gold rushes?  And how adequately does the model, designed to explain contemporary  deindustrialization, deal with the out-of-sample case of Australian gold?  We are using theory to illuminate our history, but also using history to  examine theory.5 
 THE SETTING 
 Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land), South Australia, Western Australia,  and New South Wales composed the four Australian colonies in 1850,  with Victoria and Queensland separating from New South Wales in 1851  and 1859. There were three tiers of colonial government-the British  Crown, a local administrator (usually called the "governor"), and a  partly nominated, partly elected Legislative Council. The legislature  could initiate bills on most matters, subject to the governor's right of  veto. Land was the principal natural resource of the colonies, most of it  being owned by the crown, and revenues derived from its sale or lease  were controlled by the governor. The British quid pro quo for allowing  revenue from land sales to be administered in the colonies was that half  the proceeds (after payment of certain costs) were to be used to assist  migration from Britain to Australia. Increasing the population of the  colonies was an objective of imperial policy. 
 In 1855 New South Wales and Victoria received self-government  within imperial limits, gaining rights over the disposition of crown lands.  Each negotiated a bicameral parliamentary system with a broad male  franchise for the lower house and with a conservative bias in the upper  house. By 1861 the population of Melbourne had reached 125,000 from  29,000 in 1851, compared to Chicago's 109,260 in 1860 or San Francis-  co's 56,802. Similarly, Sydney had expanded to 96,000 from 54,000.6

 The discovery of gold transformed Australia's economy and society.  The transformation was greatest in Victoria, where in the ten years 
 s We have employed the model principally to examine aggregate and general effects. It could also  be used to analyze differences between the colonies, largely ignored in the paper. Our assumption  for the most part is that the economies can be treated as one.

 Australian Gold 1051 
 1851-1860 20 million fine ounces of gold were produced. By compari-  son, New South Wales yielded a little over 2 million fine ounces.  Altogether, Australian production of gold during these years was worth  about ?87 million, a staggering sum given the 1850 population base of  only 405,000 and GDP of around ?13 million.7 The discoveries took  place on crown land, and mineral rights lay with the crown. Private  expropriation of the minerals was permitted subject to a licensing  system. 
 Gold production in Australia was not a transitory phenomenon, even  though some fields were the scene of very short bursts of mining  activity. A succession of discoveries and changes in technology ensured  that gold made a continuing (though declining) contribution to economic  activity.8 The peak years were 1853 and 1856, in which 3 million fine  ounces were produced. The trend thereafter was a very gentle decline.  In the 1860s production averaged 2 million fine ounces each year, in the  1870s almost 1.5 million, and in the 1880s still above 1 million.  Thereafter a new expansion in the gold-mining industry occurred,  especially in Queensland and Western Australia-in 1899 production  again exceeded 3 million ounces. Gold also dramatically changed the  country's export prospects-by 1853 gold production (that is, exports)  was worth more than three times the wool clip, and it was not until 1870  that the (rising) value of wool exports surpassed the (declining) value of  gold production.9 
 The initial rapid growth in gold production occurred because of the  extremely high returns to mining and low barriers to entry. The range of  digger's earnings must have been very substantial, but some indication  of the average returns of miners may be achieved by dividing the gold  production estimates by the numbers recorded as employed in the  industry, and valuing the resulting output per digger by the average  prices paid on the gold fields. From ?70 per year in 1851, the implicit  wage of the statistical average digger in Victoria leaped to ?357 in 1852.  Most miners were not wage laborers but self-employed: they earned  land rents as well as wages. A comparison with wages paid elsewhere in  the economy (see Figure 1 and Appendix Table 1) suggests a sizeable  incentive for resources to flow into gold production, and also suggests 
 7 The GDP estimate for 1850 is derived by backcasting the known 1861 GDP figure using  population and wage data from Table I and Appendix Table 1. 
 8 The rushes were initially associated with alluvial mining, but methods of extraction and the  structure of the industry changed with the rise of the more capital-intensive reef mining. In the 1854  Victorian census of occupation, 36,000 were listed as working in the gold-mining industry. In the  1857 census, when quartz mining was separately distinguished, 5 percent of the industry work force  of 62,000 were engaged in quartz mining, and by 1861 14 percent (out of the same size of work  force) were so enumerated.

 the magnitude of the problem faced by employers in other industries  who wished to retain their labor force. For the alluvial miner the ability  to pay one's fare to the field, some simple equipment, and a miner's  license were the only set-up costs, and there seem to have been few  scale economies in production. 
 The restoration of equilibrium between the returns available to labor  in gold and in other activities took some four years. It resulted from a  substantial increase in employment in gold, a fall in the returns available  on the gold fields, and a dramatic rise in wages paid in alternative  occupations. Because the price of gold was exogenously fixed during  the period, the returns to mining were determined solely by the output  per person. Although total Victorian gold production did not peak until  1856, the increase in the mining population after 1852 outstripped the  quantity recovered so that output per miner, and hence the average  return, fell continuously from 1853 to 1858. Of course, the high level of  turnover among miners, and the frequency with which mining was  combined with other employment, should be borne in mind in interpret-  ing the estimates of average returns. 
 ACCOMMODATION TO THE SHOCK 
 The rushes in 1851 and 1852 drew mainly Australians to the fields.  The male population of South Australia fell 3 percent in 1852, that of  Tasmania by 17 percent. It was late in 1852 before the first wave of  immigrants attracted by the discoveries arrived. By that time contempo- 
 rary accounts suggest that some of the local gold seekers had returned  to their initial occupations. An extremely fluid labor market appears to  have existed, with intercolonial and interindustry labor flows occurring  simultaneously with the massive immigration.'" Further, it is important 
 to keep in mind that throughout the decade the bulk of the work force  was engaged in industries other than mining: in Victoria, the proportion  in gold mining in 1854 was 29 percent, in 1857 had reached 31 percent,  but by 1861 had fallen to 26 percent. 
 The impact of the gold discoveries on other sectors of the economy  can be seen in the adjustments that occurred in the product and labor  markets. Using Victorian evidence, we have constructed a simple index  of seven series of wage rates covering rural workers, mechanics,  building workers, gold miners, female servants, and general workers,  weighted according to the composition of the work force as revealed in  the censuses of the period. The composite wage index (See Appendix  Table 1 under "Wages: Victoria" and Table 2 under "Nominal Wages:  Victoria") shows a rise of over 250 percent between 1850 and 1853,  followed by a rapid decline over the following two years. Nominal

 wages did not return to pre-gold levels, the composite index stabilizing  at around 70 percent above 1850 by the end of the decade. All the  component wage series reflect the pattern-an initial explosion followed  by a rapid adjustment to lower levels (Figure 1). There is, however,  some interesting diversity in labor market experience. The gold miners'  implicit wage, unsurprisingly, rose most and peaked first (in 1852). In  other industries, skilled tradesmens' wages rose by the greatest amount,  presumably reflecting acute labor shortages and nonsubstitutability in  the nontraded goods sector, especially in the building industry. In the  rural sector, pastoral wages (shepherds) rose less than those of general  farm laborers, possibly because of the declining Victorian sheep popula-  tion, and possibly because there was scope for labor-saving changes in  grazing. Nevertheless, even pastoral wages doubled between 1850 and  1853, and as an export industry unable to influence its prices, the  doubling in shepherds' wages between 1850 and 1853 must have created  a serious cost-price squeeze for woolgrowers. By the end of the decade,  however, relative wages for shepherds had increased, a reflection  possibly of the rise in international wool prices and improved efficie
 in the industry. Finally, we might note that female servants' wages at  first also fell relative to the general level of wages, but subsequently  held fairly steady, while other wage rates tumbled sharply. As a strictly

 nontraded activity, it might have been anticipated that the demand for  domestic service would have moved more in line with those of skilled  tradesmen. The demand for servants, however, probably only strength-  ened after the boom in incomes had led to an expansion in urban  household formation. It should also be noted that because of the  conscious government policy to assist the immigration of single women,  female wages would have risen less than otherwise. Domestic service  was in a sense less a strictly nontraded activity in Australia during the  1850s. Certainly the different movement of women's wages reflects a  degree of segregation in the labor market. 
 The movement in relative product prices is as consistent with the  predictions of the model we are employing as is the behavior of labor  market prices. If the small-economy assumption is valid, export and  import prices should be unaffected by the boom. It appears from Figure  2 that such was indeed the case (the notes in the Appendix show which  commodities are included in which class). Using data from New South  Wales (Victorian price data are unavailable), the price of imports rose in  1854 but otherwise moved very little. The increase reflected a compara-  ble rise in world commodity prices as a result of the Crimean War and  the contribution to world money supply of Californian and Australian  gold. If shortages (and gluts) in imported goods occurred in Sydney in  the early 1850s, as suggested by many accounts, they were not so severe

 or prolonged as to have been reflected in the annual average prices of  imported goods. Similarly, the export price of wool (London prices of  Australian wool) shows only a modest rise during the decade. By  contrast, the prices of domestically produced goods for home consump-  tion rose dramatically. Goods facing import competition could not get  too far out of line with world prices, but still had risen by almost 60  percent between 1850 and 1855 before leveling off. Those with no close  import substitutes, the strictly nontradable commodities, experienced a  200 percent rise in their prices by 1854 in New South Wales. The  evidence available for Victoria suggests that the extent of the rise in  similar items may have been even greater. 
 WOOL 
 In models of export booms the lagging export sector is predicted to be  adversely affected, whether exchange rates are flexible or fixed. Under  a fixed-rate regime the domestic inflation induced by the boom raises  the domestic cost of lagging export industries, thereby reducing their  competitiveness in foreign markets. At least a relative contraction of the  lagging export sector is predicted. 
 Wool had been the dominant export industry in Australia at mid-  century and despite fluctuating fortunes it was to remain the leading  export staple for most of the following century. During the decade of the  gold rushes, however, wool exports from Australia grew at much  reduced rates compared to the decade preceding and following. From  British import statistics it appears that the volume of Australian wool  exports expanded from 12 to 42 million pounds weight between 1841 and  1851, a growth rate of 13 percent per year on average, with sheep  numbers up 11 percent per year. The annual growth rate of the flock w
 only about 3 percent during the 1850s, but jumped to 7 percent during  the decade of the 1860s. The question here is whether or not the pause in  the expansion of the Australian wool industry during the 1850s was due  to the gold rush. 
 The slower growth in wood production cannot be explained by a fall  in demand. Australian wool prices rose during the decade, by 44 percent  on the all-important London market, an increase greater than the rise in  the general British/world commodity prices. It is likely that Australia  was still a price taker on the international wool market, so an expanded  volume of wool exports to Britain during the 1850s is unlikely to have  affected prices greatly." But the relevant variable for any analysis of 
 the woolgrowers' behavior is the price received. Whether a greater 
 " The position of Australia in the international wool market during the nineteenth century  deserves further study. There are no estimates available of the price elasticity of demand for  Australian wool for the period despite its importance in exports and development.

 wedge opened up between London and farm gate prices during the  1850s is difficult to ascertain. The costs of transporting wool between  Australia and Britain almost certainly fell, primarily because of the  increased shipping capacity on the return journey after bringing out  miners and the greatly increased volume of imports. 12 On the other  hand, the costs of transport between farm and Australian port, at least  during the early and mid-1850s, must have risen steeply, in line with the  rise in the prices of other strictly nontradable goods and services. 
 The woolgrower faced other upward cost pressures on the farm, most  notably from wages. The ratio of shepherd's wages to wool prices rises  from a base of 100 in 1850 to 161 in 1855 and then slowly falls to 127 by  1858. Historians have cited contemporary accounts of pastoralists  losing their entire work force at the news of a gold find, though a more  complex pattern of labor movements between mining and pastoral  pursuits seems more likely. Miners who were unsuccessful at the  diggings might return at periods of peak seasonal labor demand (such as  the shearing). The high level of wages in other sectors meant that  increases in pastoral wages were necessary to retain labor. Alternative-  ly, facing fixed world prices, pastoralists could have maintained profit-  ability by using their labor more efficiently. The scope for rapid labor-  saving changes in pastoral technology was probably limited. There is  evidence, however, that the labor-intensive task of washing the sheep  prior to shearing became less common. Similarly, more labor-saving  fencing techniques were adopted. 
 An important repercussion of the gold rushes on wool production was  the exploitation of the joint product nature of investment in sheep  (which yielded meat and tallow as well as wool). Until the late 1880s,  when refrigeration opened up the possibility of large-scale exports, the  demand for meat remained basically a domestic demand, and rose  rapidly with the increase in population and incomes. Thus the price of  meat (a nontraded commodity) rose relative to that of wool, provoking a  partial redirection of sheep-raising activities from wool to meat produc-  tion (that is, from the lagging sector to nontradables). There are  accounts of flocks of sheep being driven long distances to the gold fields  for slaughter. The fall in sheep numbers in Victoria of one-quarter by  the mid-1850s (contrast, for example, with the modest growth in New  South Wales) reflects the higher rate of slaughtering there. The conse-  quent stagnation in Australian flock numbers led to a lower volume of  wool exports. 
 The wool industry did not collapse under the impact of the gold  rushes, though its rate of growth was slowed. Sheep farmers adapted to 
 12 Gold, after all, is distinguished as an export commodity by its high value to bulk ratio. The  decline in ocean freight rates led to a reduction in the practice of "dumping"'--compressing bales of  wool prior to shipment. See W. Westgarth, The Colony of Victoria: Its History, Commerce and  Gold Mining (London, 1864), pp. 269-70.

 the changed opportunities by altering their product mix and production  technology. They eventually benefited from reduced internal transport  costs wherever roads had been improved and railways constructed.'3  The decline in relative meat prices in the late 1850s was followed in the  1860s by a resumed rapid expansion of wool exporting and numbers of  sheep. 
 EFFECTS ON IMPORT-COMPETING AND NONTRADABLE GOODS 
 Whether the import-competing industries contract absolutely, or  merely grow more slowly than the economy overall, depends on such  factors as the degree of substitutability with imports and the extent of  the domestic wage increases. Particular nontradables may experience  varying degrees of prosperity according to variation in their income  elasticities of demand and their cost structure. 
 In the 1850s (as now) there was a continuum of domestically produced  goods running from those with fairly close imported substitutes (for  example, wheat, beer, coarse cloth, some mining equipment) to those  facing no real import competition (for example, perishable foods,  internal transport services, building trades). Look again at the move-  ments in relative prices (Figure 2). The import price index rose by  nearly 30 percent by mid-decade, falling to less than 20 percent above  the pre-rush level by the early 1860s. Since world price levels rose about  20 percent during the 1850s the figures suggest that the assumption of a  small economy for which the price of importables was fixed appears  justified, and that any shortages in imported commodities were not so  serious as to produce a dramatic rise in the price of imports.14 The  prices of commodities that were likely to have faced some degree of  import competition rose less dramatically (about 50 percent over their  1850 price) than the prices of those closer to being strictly nontradables  (over 100 percent). The ranking of the price movements in imports,  import-competing, and nontradable goods seems consistent with other  evidence. First, as we have said, the average price of 12 items of male  clothing, nearly all of which would have been imported, shows similar  behavior to the import prices. Second, for each of four commodities for  which we have both domestic and imported products with separately  quoted prices the domestic price rises relative to the import price. 
 Thus it is not surprising that the gold rushes were accompanied by a  massive increase in the volume of imports. Expressed in per capita

 14 The important role played in containing the price movement by anticipations that induced  speculative importation is noted by T. A. Coghlan, Labor and Industry in Australia (Melbourne,  1969, first published in 1918), vol. 2, pp. 786-87, though in the paper we ignore the role played by  expectations.

 terms the value of retained imports more than treble in New South  Wales in the early 1850s while in Victoria they rise fivefold between  1851 and 1853. At the end of the decade, and in both colonies, the per 
 capita values are still more than twice the pre-rush level.  In the agricultural sector (excluding wool production), the observed  adjustments to the boom are scarcely surprising. Wheat could be  imported to supplement local production, but straw for fodder was  much closer to being a nontradable.'5 There is evidence especially in  Victoria that it became more profitable to cut wheat and oat crops for  straw rather than for grain, a practice that may also have been  encouraged by the high cost of harvest labor. Another response to the  changed conditions facing the farmer was the growth in demand for  fresh milk, butter, and cheese, presumably population-related, and  facing only limited competition from imports. In Victoria there was a  considerable growth in cattle numbers whereas the sheep population  declined. Although a division between dairy and beef cattle was not  made in the colonial statistics, this is consistent with the substitution in  production from wool towards mutton, pork, beef, and dairy products. 6  The impact of the gold rushes on manufacturing can be seen in the  experience of New South Wales. 17 In 1850 there were some 165  manufacturing establishments, with the most numerous being tanneries,  breweries, soap and candle making, iron and brass foundries, and  tobacco preparation, with smaller numbers of factories engaged in meat  preserving, the making of woolen cloth, rope, salt, hats, and pottery,  sugar refining, and distilling. The majority of these enterprises would  have faced direct import competition; it is not surprising to find that  their number declined in the early 1850s to around 140, only recovering  to the original level at the end of the decade. By this admittedly crude  measure, import-competing manufacturing was adversely affected by  the rushes. But it was not ruined, probably because of an increase of 77  percent in the New South Wales population during the decade and a  doubling of real wages. Thus for part of nontradables the resource  movement effect appears to have been approximately offset by the  spending effect and demand generated by increased population. The  same forces operated, however, to expand manufacturing activity in

 16 Coghlan, Labor and Industry, vol. 2, pp. 679-80, worried about the different trends in New  South Wales and Victoria without resolving the issue. Clearly in New South Wales, further from  the main population centers, the demands for perishable animal products would not have set up the  same inducement to substitute. With respect to Victoria, Westgarth noted: "If a digging makes an  uncomfortable uproar in the midst of a squatting district, yet it brings to the squatter's door what  his success greatly depends on, a ready market for his surplus live stock" (The Colony of Victoria,  p. 264). 
 17 The numbers of manufacturing establishments in Victoria are too small at the start of the  period for sensible comparison.

 two areas directly associated with housing and construction activity,  namely, sawmills and brickmaking. Indeed, the growth at the end of the  decade in the recorded number of manufactories is primarily due to  increases in these enterprises-though some of the growth may be due  to improved coverage of the factory statistics. Bricks are probably close  to being a pure nontradable commodity.'8 
 GOVERNMENT 
 The literature on supply shocks considers the role of government on  three levels: as a manager of monetary and exchange rate instruments  influencing the nature and extent of the restructuring required by the  boom, as a supplier of services the demand for which will have  increased with the spending effect, and as a redistributor influencing  exactly who should bear the burdens and receive the benefits. 
 Colonial governments of the early 1850s had no power over the  money supply or the exchange rate. The adjustment, therefore, took the  form of an inflation driven by the wage rates available in mining, the  high level of which induced intersectoral and international migration.'9  A policy of allowing sufficient migration to reduce wages back to their  original level (in terms of tradable goods) would remove the pressure  from the tradable goods sector. It leads also to a still greater expansion  of nontradables, because demand is boosted by addition to the popula-  tion. Thus a policy of allowing substantial migration can lessen the  disruptive effects of a supply shock. As the booming industry runs  down, however, the demand for labor diminishes and wages fall. This  may induce outmigration and a return of the economy to its pre-gold  equilibrium. 
 Governments actively pursued a policy of expanding the population  of the Australian colonies. Of Australia's 551,000 apparent net immi-  grants during the 1850s, 230,740 were assisted, of whom 45 percent were  males (see Table 1). Among these were pastoral laborers recruited with  the explicit object of replacing labor lost to the gold fields, and there  seem to have been no impediments placed in the path of unassisted  migrants.20 Clearly the per capita benefits accruing to the pre-gold 
 18 The building trades in the period were the first in Australia to obtain the eight-hour day-as  discussed by Helen Hughes, "The Eight Hour Day and the Development of the Labor Movement  in Victoria in the Eighteen-Fifties," Historical Studies, 9 (May 1961), 396-410. Coghlan, Labor  and Industry, vol. 2, p. 799, notes that the inflation was such that builders stopped offering fixed-  price contracts.

 laborers in Australia were lowered below what they might otherwise  have been as a result of the immigration policy (unless the economies of  scale were very important). 
 But the long-run policy problem, given the perceived need to populate  the colonies, was how to induce the migrants to stay. Wages would need  to be maintained at or above the pre-gold level to prevent equilibrating  emigration as employment in the gold industry contracted. The actual  path of real wages in Australia compared with those in Britain is shown  in Figure 3 and Table 2 under "Real Wages." The sizable gap that  opened up in Australia's favor by 1852 was quickly closed. Indeed, real  wages in the colonies appear to have fallen below their 1850 level by  mid-decade, before being restored by 1860-a case perhaps of initial  overadjustment.21 
 Gold discovered on crown land was the property of the crown. In  1849 a rush near Melbourne had been broken up by force on the grounds  of trespass. When gold was discovered in 1851 the governors of New  South Wales and Victoria both decided to allow mining for private gain 
 21 The comparisons are relative to 1850 levels, and are not based on absolute differences in real  wages between the two countries. It seems likely that the Victorian real-wage level after 1854 as  recorded is too low but the trends are clear. The continued immigration into Victoria following the  elimination of any real wage gap may be due to imperfect information flows to potential migrants or  lags in the transmission of revised information about economic conditions in Victoria.

 regulated by a license fee and restricted to a small designated piece of  ground. Claims were tiny, finally regulated in Victoria in 1853 to a  standard 12-feet square, about one-fortieth of Californian practice. Part  of the reason may have been administrative, that is, widening access to  the diggings, lessening the potential ill will of those excluded, and  reducing the area to be administered. On the other hand, it must have  increased the number of people who went to the fields and must have  evened out the distribution of the gains.22 Although it is difficult to make  comparisons, during the 1850s Victoria does appear to have gained  more people than did California, despite lower aggregate gold produc-  tion. The policy of ceding tiny claims was reconsidered several times  but retained.23 This policy, together with the absence of impediments to  migration, and the active assistance even of male migrants, can be  viewed as the elements of a developmental strategy that had the effect of  lessening the disruptive effects of the supply shock. 
 Government as a supplier of services faced problems similar to those  faced by other employers. Table 3 indicates the revenue and expendi-  ture trends of the governments in Victoria and New South Wales over  the decade. Higher income levels induced a demand for the services that  governments provided, though labor costs had gone up dramatically.  Because private demand for imports and for land increased, government  revenues from customs duties and land sales also rose, partly financing  the provision of extra services. Many of these demands required capital  expenditure, and the governments began to borrow. Nevertheless,  difficulties arose because expenditures tended to outstrip revenues, and  the legislature was reluctant to subsidize the booming gold industry (for  example, financing policing of the gold fields) out of general revenue.  New taxes were thus levied on the gold industry, taxes that may be  viewed as taxes on resource rents. 
 Two different classes of tax on gold were imposed: lease license fees  levied on the right to mine (not on production) were preferred initially  but were replaced by export duties. Use of the mining fees provoked  considerable animosity, as in the famous insurrection at Eureka in  Victoria, caused by inequity between successful and unsuccessful  diggers.24 Export duties were opposed by merchants. The picture was 
 22 These points have been made admirably by G. Blainey, "The Gold Rushes: The Year of  Decision," Historical Studies, 10 (May 1962), 138-39. There has been some discussion of the  "high" license fee being set and administered to discourage population flows to the fields. The siz of the migrations (sectoral, regional, and international) shows that they had little effect. At most,  high fees should be seen as an attempt by pastoralists to segment the labor market in order to retai their own workers. 
 23 Californian solutions to similar problems are described in J. Umbeck, "The Californian Gold  Rush: A Study of Emerging Property Rights," Explorations in Economic History, 14 (July 1977),  197-226. 
 24 The incident and its causes have provoked a substantial literature: see G. Serle, The Golden  Age: A History of the Colony of Victoria, 1851-1861 (Melbourne, 1963), chap. 6.

 complicated-duties were managed by the legislature, where merchants  had considerable influence, license fees by the governors for the crown.  After the insurrection the emphasis was switched to duties.25 
 The third role suggested for government in the theoretical literature is  as a redistributor of the impact of the boom. Lacking an income tax the  main redistributive taxes available to colonial governments were the  customs duty and the gold taxes. Before the discovery of gold the  colonies had switched to revenue ("free trade") tariffs levied on a few  consumption items-spirits, wines, tea, coffee, sugar, and tobacco. The  effects of such a tariff must have been regressive, but administrative  ease of collection was probably important in the hectic early years of the  boom. With the gold tax levied for much of the period at a flat rate on all  who wished to mine, it is clear that government policy during the boom  did little to alter the impact of the benefits. There is little evidence until  the late 1850s of any call in the gold colonies for protection of the  manufacturing, agriculture, or pastoral industries. 
 Rather than allow employment to contract as the demand for labor in  the gold fields fell off, the government followed an active policy of  expanding the demand for labor in agriculture, providing wives and  giving access to land, thereby maintaining the labor supply above the  level to which it might have fallen had emigration following the rushes  been greater. 
 25 Goodwin, "British Economists," points out that the canons of public finance as perceived in  the 1850s supported the production levy.

 CONCLUSION 
 We have examined the impact on the Australian colonies in the 1850s  of the massive economic disturbance resulting from the discovery of  rich deposits of gold. Colonial society, politics, and economies were  massively changed by 1860. No subsequent decade in Australian history  has witnessed comparable upheavals. There were important long-run  consequences of the gold rushes for the development of the Australian  economy during the remainder of the nineteenth century. The immi-  grant inflow of the 1850s did not reverse itself in the 1860s-the great  majority settled permanently in Australia, were employed in farming,  manufacturing, or the services industries, and invested their savings and  their labor in their new country.26 
 The model of the structural adjustment of a small economy to a  supply-side shock, described by Corden among others, seems to  provide a useful framework for consideration of the case of Australian  gold during the 1850s. The expansion of the booming industry, the  relative contraction of other export industries and those that compete  with imports, and the equilibrating role played by the nontradable  sector, together describe the short-run effects well. The distinction  between nontradable and tradable explains a number of puzzles-for  example, movements of numbers of sheep and cattle, production of  wheat and hay, and production in different branches of colonial manu-  facturing activity. The dominance of the spending effect of the boom  over the resource movement effect after the first couple of years seems  clear. 
 The literature misses, however, the importance of population flows as  an equilibrating device, and population policy as an instrument of boom  management. Application of the expanded model to supply shocks in  other regions of recent settlement (for example, California or the  Yukon) will be needed to assess the general applicability of the  arguments we have adopted. For Australia the result was plain: living  standards rose little as a result of the gold discoveries. Population  expanded instead.
