THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE VICTORIAN GOLD RUSHES: MINERS’ ACCOUNTS DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS 
BY WARWICK FROST 
La Trobe University 
Research into the environmental impacts of gold rushes has tended to be limited, with only a small number of broad descriptive studies. This article provides a new approach in three ways. First, it is confined to a specific small time period – the initial five years – rather than trying to cover all aspects of a long period. Second, it analyses the environmental impacts in terms of the activities under taken by the miners. A focus on activities was chosen in preference to types of impact as a means of centring attention on humans as agents of change. Third, it utilises a wide range of accounts by miners to examine the changes they observed.

INTRODUCTION 
In 1976, J. M. Powell wrote Environmental Management in Australia, 1788–1914, the first general environmental history of Australia. As a pioneer in the field, he took the opportunity to predict future directions for research: 
We urgently require a thorough evaluation of the profits and losses to the Australian environment which were registered in the major years of pastoral expansion [1830s– 40s] and in the succeeding confusion of mining activity during the ‘fifties [1850s] . . . Hasten the day when biogeographers, geomorphologists and historical geographers combine to interpret and communicate the ecological impact of both the ‘Squatting Age’ and the ‘Golden Age’. 
There has since been a great deal of research into the environmental changes that resulted from pastoralism1 but far less into the impact of the gold rushes. My

aim in this article is to further our understanding of these environmental impacts. My focus is on the first five years of the Victorian gold rushes, which were characterised by the rapid inflow of hundreds of thousands of miners who engaged in surface alluvial mining in a previously lightly populated area. The gold rushes were a rapid and sharp shock to a series of systems – political, social, economic, and particularly environmental. In examining the environmental impact, my main sources are books and diaries written by the miners at the time. My goal is to explore the nature of these impacts utilising a framework based on the various activities associated with alluvial mining. I do not seek to calculate an environmental profit and loss, a term that I believe Powell did not mean literally (nor do I believe one could be calculated). In considering the environmental effects, this study is placed within the context of the growing field of environmen tal history. 
Several researchers have identified different types of approaches to environ mental history. Choices regarding the utilisation of these approaches affect any examination of the environmental impacts of the gold rushes. Donald Worster, acknowledging that historians are generally interested in change and its economic or social impacts, argued that for the ‘new’ environmental historians, ‘the reor ganisation of nature, not merely of society, is what we must uncover’.2 Building on this idea, John McNeill proposed a typology of three varieties. First, ‘material environmental history concerns itself with changes in biological and physical environments and how those changes affect human societies’. Second, cultural environmental history examined ‘representations and images of nature in arts and letters, how these have changed, and what they reveal about the people and societies’. The third was a political variety, which was concerned with ‘law and state policy’.3 A further variety, suggested by John MacKenzie, is the apocalyptic, which presents a wide range of cases where human action has resulted in unin tended disastrous consequences for the environment.4 
Examining the environmental impact of the gold rushes requires a considera tion of all these perspectives. As McNeill argued, they jostle each other amiably, they are not exclusive, and should not be considered separately, or in isolation to each other. Rather, there is a strong benefit in any environmental history study taking account of all of these varieties and that is the approach taken in this article.

(though some even ignored them altogether).5 Weston Bate’s detailed study of Ballarat contained a strong environmental perspective, particularly on what the natural landscape was like prior to the discovery of gold.6 For almost a quarter of a century after Powell and Bate, there was little examination of the environmental history of the gold rushes. This deficiency in the literature was highlighted in two recent historiographical reviews of environmental history in Australasia. John McNeill observed that ‘even mining, a pillar of the modern Australian economy, has yet to attract environmental historians’, and Libby Robin and Tom Griffiths concluded that ‘mining history is surprisingly absent from the environmental literature’.7 
The 150th anniversary of the Victorian gold rushes in 2001 resulted in two introductory, overview articles on environmental impacts, by Don Garden and Barry McGowan, respectively, both in scholarly commemorative volumes. These new interpretations of the effects of the gold rushes, within volumes of collected chapters, were necessarily exploratory and short. Garden drew on just two primary sources, both from the 1850s – a book by William Howitt and the diary of Ellen Clacy – plus some excellent photos to illustrate the scale and severity of environmental change. McGowan, an archaeologist, introduced environmental change through exploring the extreme effects of large scale hydraulic sluicing and dredging.8 In addition, there was good coverage of the environment in the more general histories released for the commemoration by Robyn Annear and Geoff Hocking, the latter being valuable for the high quality reproduction of many contemporary illustrations.9 
More recently, research has tended to be thematic, focusing on single aspects, relationships, or impacts. Ian Rae examined the use of arsenic to separate gold from ore and its continuing effects on the environment. Warwick Frost focused on how environmental damage is interpreted in the national parks of the Victorian goldfields. Geoffrey Russell provided a detailed account of the public policy and engineering difficulties in constructing an effective water supply system for the Bendigo goldfield.10 
Comparative studies are noticeably lacking. The introduction to the recent special issue on Gold in the Australian Economic History Review argued strongly for the need for a comparative approach to better understand the gold rushes. It proposed the need for studies to ‘integrate the histories of individual goldfields with global histories of migration, trade and colonization’.11

Victorian gold rushes 75 
Understanding the environmental impacts of the Australian gold rushes requires comparisons with other gold rush regions, particularly California, Canada, and New Zealand. Indeed, in undertaking that comparison, it is striking that the historiography of these other regions is often more advanced than Australia’s. 
The recent sesquicentennial of the Californian gold rushes and the centenary of the Klondike resulted in the publication of detailed books on mining and envi ronmental change in both regions.12 This is in marked contrast to the Australian anniversary only producing two short introductory articles. The similar experi ences of California and the Australian goldfields is the basis for a book by Ian Tyrrell examining how gold was a catalyst for changes in environmental attitudes and policy.13 A recent general study of the gold rushes in Colorado incorporated a strong examination of the environmental changes wrought by the miners, particularly in travelling to the goldfields.14 For New Zealand, a recent collection on environmental history included a chapter on the impact of alluvial dredging and argued that there is a need for much further research.15 
This study is not intended as a comparative study of the environmental impacts of mining (though that is recognised as an excellent topic for further research). Rather, in briefly touching upon these other studies, particularly in North America, my intention is to highlight how little has been accomplished in this field for Australia. A historiographical survey demonstrates that the literature on the environmental effects of the gold rushes remains limited. We need to move beyond introductory surveys and even beyond thematic studies. This article seeks to extend our understanding by looking more deeply into the impacts, utilising a wider range of contemporary accounts. 
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, ISSUES, AND SOURCES 
The scale of the Australian gold rushes works against more comprehensive analy sis. The rushes occurred in all Australian states, in a large number of places, and involved hundreds of thousands of people. They spanned over 50 years, during which new rushes were continually occurring. The environments they affected included mountains and plains, rainforests, and eucalypt woodlands (in Victoria, the box–ironbark eucalypt ecosystem is particularly associated with gold), arid grasslands, and alpine heath. Gold mining techniques varied and can be divided into a number of types based on where the gold was located and how it was extracted. The main types include fossicking, surface (or shallow) alluvial, deep alluvial, deep lead (or reef), sluicing, and dredging. Some goldfields were

dominated by one type of mining, at some a range could occur in close proximity, and at others a number could be tried at the same site over the years. The primary source evidence of environmental change is also on a large scale, ranging from detailed contemporary books, diaries, reminiscences, sketches, paint ings, and photographs to still existing landscapes crammed with diggings, ruins, pits, shafts, water channels, and mullock heaps. Today, a wide range of former goldfields landscapes are protected and interpreted as national or state parks.16 What is needed is some way to make sense of this overwhelming variety and complexity. The approach proposed here is to consider a framework of activities by which gold miners affected their environment. This is founded on the argu ments of Worster and McNeill that humans are the drivers of environmental history and draws particularly on McNeill’s ‘material’ and ‘cultural’ typologies.17 This framework is proposed heuristically and is not intended as a rigorous explanatory model. It is intended to provide shaping to an extensive array of contemporary accounts, ordering them into key themes rather than chronologi cally or geographically. The activities considered here are listed in the rough order as undertaken by miners and cover a wider range of effects than just the act of mining for gold. The activities are travelling, burning, digging, processing, timber cutting, eating, shooting, wasting, building, and contemplating. Activities were chosen in preference to types of impact as a way of focusing attention on humans as agents of change. This emphasis on humans being at the centre of environ mental change is in line with the developments in environmental history discussed earlier in this article. 
In considering this framework of activities, it is important to examine them in the context of a specific time period and place. The difficult balancing act is between a context that is too narrow or too broad. My focus is on the first five years of the Victorian gold rushes, particularly at Ballarat, Bendigo, Castlemaine (all discovered in 1851), and Beechworth (1852). Though gold was first discovered in New South Wales in 1851, it was its discovery in Victoria later that year that had the far greater impact. Between 1851 and 1861, 88 per cent of all gold mined in Australia was from Victoria. Focusing on this short time period captures the sense that this was a rapid, even extreme, shock to the existing environmental system and avoids the trap of spreading the study over too long a time. 
The early Victorian gold rushes were large scale and as they occurred in areas that had previously been only sparsely settled, had a major and immediate effect. In 1850, six months before the discovery of gold, Victoria’s population was just over 70,000. Within two years, Victoria’s population had doubled and then doubled again by mid-1855. By 1859, the population of the colony was in excess of 500,000.18 At no other time in Australia’s history would there be such an influx of people in such a short time. These early rushes were primarily shallow alluvial,

though there were the beginnings of more complex techniques. They occurred in undulating eucalypt woodlands, which had only recently been settled by Europe ans, who had quickly adapted them for extensive sheep grazing. 
The main sources used in this article are accounts written by diggers in keeping with McNeill’s ‘cultural’ variety of environmental approaches. I have utilised 12 main contemporary sources. These take the form either of books written at the time, published diaries, or collections of later reminiscences. This group of books encompasses the most well-known and widely used accounts of the Victorian gold rushes. Supporting these written accounts, I have also used a range of contem porary paintings, sketches, and photographs drawn from the excellent illustrated history by Hocking.19 My focus is on written accounts and diaries as these are the sources where detailed observations and reflections of environmental impact were more likely to be recorded. In contrast, preliminary examination of newspapers and official records (such as mining warden reports) showed that in this period, these tended to be primarily factual, focused on production and technical inno vation and did not include such descriptions nor reflections of environmental impacts. 
As a collection of primary sources, some limitations are recognised. Nearly all of these accounts were written by young men, most were English, a few from continental Europe. There were no contemporary accounts by Chinese or Abo rigines and surprisingly few from those who also went to the Californian gold rushes. I also note that there may be potentially valuable sources, such as unpub lished letters, which I have been unable to access. 
TRAVELLING 
The early gold discoveries were between 100 and 300 km inland of Melbourne, in mainly sheep farming country, sparsely settled with no major towns. To get to the gold, hundreds of thousands of miners, laden with equipment and food had to travel along rough bush tracks, moving as quickly as possible for fear that the gold would run out. Catering for such a large volume of traffic, dirt roads became quagmires after rain. To avoid the mud, the travellers created their own detours, repeating the process as these became fouled. Antoine Fauchery described the main Geelong–Ballarat road as ‘twenty capricious tracks that wind through the trees’.20 Ellen Clacy recorded that ‘no distinct road is ever cut out, but the whole country is cut up into innumerable tracks by the carts and drays’.21 Another found that only 32 km out of Melbourne, ‘the roads here branch off by fifty or more different tracks, every man taking what he believes to be the best or shortest path’.

A fourth traveller thought the roads resembled ‘an English ploughed field after three days hard rain’.22 The constant effort to go around the mud damaged existing properties as travellers cut through gardens and fields.23 
The mud took a heavy toll on transport. At the Black Forest on the road to Castlemaine and Bendigo, the scene was described as a ‘perfect bedlam’, where ‘bogged and broken drays lay about; and the carcasses and skeletons of horses and bullocks’. Drayman John Chandler saw many bullocks and horses perish in the mud.24 Klaus Gronn recorded the Black Forest in similar terms: 
As far as the eye could see, there appeared: waterhole after endless waterhole; deep muddy furrows; broken-down wagons; dead horses and bullocks; and clothes, baskets, and gear of every sort – all abandoned in obvious despair.25 
At other times, lack of water was the problem for transport as recorded in Martyrs of the Road (1851) by William Strutt, a watercolour of two horses lying dead among bullock bones by the side of a dusty busy road.26 
The activity of travelling generated environmental change over a wide area, often in places where no gold was found. Much of this was pastoral land (cropping was then almost non-existent). In the struggle to get through quickly, there was damage to fences, roads, and watercourses. Graziers tried in vain to stop the trespassers.27 
For many of the miners, this was their first experience with the natural envi ronment of Victoria, even Australia. Their journey to the goldfields was critical for establishing patterns of behaviour and attitudes towards the natural environment. In the accounts of these journeys, we see the beginning of anthropocentric atti tudes regarding the miners and nature. Their perceptions are that humans are at the centre of the world, they have sovereignty over nature, and it is permissible to exploit it at any cost in order to ultimately gain gold. 
BURNING 
Prior to commencing digging, the miners needed to clear away obstructing trees, shrubs, and grasses. The quickest and easiest way to do this was through fire. Indeed, in many instances, a good burn might immediately reveal some surface gold. As Pyne has noted, ‘burning was an ancient ally of prospecting’.28 Such a process had begun with a massive bush fire, known as Black Thursday, which had

occurred five months before on 6 February 1851. In burning vegetation across approximately a quarter of Victoria,29 it probably aided the discovery of gold. The burning of the bush could be extensive. In 1854, William Howitt arrived in the Buckland Valley: 
The grass and scrub were nearly all burnt up by the diggers, who burn up the country wherever they go, as they say, to get rid of the snakes . . . Nearly all the country for thirty miles [54 km] and more, along this river, is thus burnt up.30 
For many, lighting fires was a symbolic release from the restrictions of society back in Europe. One jubilant English miner wrote back home that ‘we were never at a loss for a fire; for, thank God! We can make a fire where we like, or burn what we like, and nobody to interfere with us’. Accordingly, he ‘made up a fire large enough to roast an ox’.31 James Robertson recalled ‘here we camped out, felled trees, lighted fires, roamed around shooting free from any molestation by any biped’.32 At night Howitt lit a fire ‘as is customary, we made [it] against the foot of a tree, which itself burning, increases the heat and throws it back towards you’. After a while, he realised that the burning tree would fall on his tent, so he relocated. The tree collapsed at 4 am. Travelling the next day, he came upon a smouldering tree, an abandoned campfire.33 An unimpressed Seweryn Korzelin ski sniffed that: 
The sound of axes and the noise of falling tree trunks comes from all sides. The English often cut down trees without actual need. They do it simply for fun, because here they can indulge their liking for the fuel which is as rare as saffron in their own land.34 
Again, the miners quickly saw themselves as dominant over nature. What is surprising is that such behaviour did not result in more bush fires. Drought in the 1840s and the severe fire in 1851 probably combined to reduce potential fuel. The bush fires that were recorded tended to be light and localised, included as novel examples of dangers of the exotic wilderness.35 It is intriguing that wildfire and the widespread propensity to light fires are not so strongly featured in accounts of other goldfields. 
The miners quickly generated a pattern where they used fire to clear vegeta tion. This had long-term impacts on the natural environment as patterns of future behaviour were established. For decades to come, ‘burning off’ would be a common practice among farmers. It would be former miners and their children that would cut and burn the dense forests of the east coast in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.36 The alacrity with which newcomers started

lighting fires again demonstrated how they were viewing their relationship with the new environment and what destructive activities were permissible in the pursuit of gold. 
DIGGING 
The digging of holes was the most obvious manifestation of the search for gold. At first, the diggers panned for gold in existing streams but then shifted their atten tion to ancient creek beds, often deep underground. Howitt saw a rush unfold, ‘the whole scene, which a few hours before was a green sward, [now] looked like a tumbled stone-quarry’.37 Most of the writers were conscious that the concept of the diggings was unfamiliar to their readers and stretched their imagination to find metaphors for them. Clacy described the diggings as similar to gravel pits. Rob ertson saw them as looking similar to a graveyard. Fauchery held that the ‘ground [had] as many holes as a sieve’. Gronn described how ‘the countryside lay pockmarked with shafts and mullock-heaps’. William Kelly was of the opinion that ‘the whole region seemed, in reality, turned inside out, entrails uppermost, producing as repugnant an effect as well can be imagined’.38 The only metaphor missing was that of a battlefield, but as Europe had known nearly 40 years of peace, this did not spring to the minds of the observers. 
Others went for exactness or detail in their descriptions. Edward Snell recorded that at Mount Alexander in 1852, ‘for about 10 miles [16 km] in every direction . . . the ground [was] full of immense holes, many of them 30 feet [9 m] deep’.39 Howitt described the valley of the Bendigo Creek in 1853 as ‘the whole of it riddled with holes from ten to eighty feet [3 to 25 m] deep – all one huge chaos of clay, gravel, stones and pipe-clay, thrown up out of the bowels of the earth’.40 
Scenes of numerous shafts and mullock heaps were represented extensively in drawings and paintings.41 Most striking are a series of 1858 photographs (known as Sun Pictures at the time) taken by Antoine Fauchery and Richard Daintree, confirming the descriptions of the writers earlier (Figs 1–3).42 
Initially, the miners dug into the creek beds. In some cases, they dammed creeks and worked the dry bed.43 They quickly came to understand the geology of gold and the wider possibilities for finding it. Ancient creek beds rich with gold were sometimes discovered at higher levels than existing water, such as at Red Hill in

Bendigo, or buried under volcanic flows, such as at Ballarat and Daylesford. The latter called for increasingly complicated and expensive machinery, and their working required the formation of companies. Digging deeper and on a larger scale, they generated enormous mullock heaps.44 
This extensive digging caused ecological changes that the miners found difficult to understand. In the box–ironbark forests, soil disturbance led to a rapid spread of the indigenous shrub Cassinia arcuta. The miners, not having noticed it before, assumed it was an exotic. Being unknown in Europe, they deduced it must have been introduced by Chinese miners and named it accordingly Chinese Broom. 
PROCESSING 
Processing ore was dependent on water as gold could only be extracted from gravel and mud through washing. At Bendigo, ‘every water hole thronged with

cradles and tubs – no chance of shoving in even a pannikin, the water as thick as treacle and fast being used up’.45 The result was that what had been ‘crystaline [sic] water will be made thick and foul with gold-washing’.46 At Castlemaine and Whroo, miners took control of ancient Aboriginal rock wells. Initially, the ore was processed in hand-operated cradles but miners soon constructed larger scale ‘puddling machines’ operated by horse power. By 1856, there were 3,000 of these in the Bendigo region, each requiring between 500 and 1,200 gal (2,250 to 5,400 litres) of water per day.47 
At Castlemaine and Bendigo, there was little surface water so miners had to either wait for winter rains, dig wells, or carry soil 5 to 8 km to water. All these options had major opportunity costs, diverting labour and resources from the business of digging and processing. A bemused Robert Cecil saw the arrest of two diggers for breaching the Sabbath, caught with sacks of dirt on their shoulders trudging in search of water on a Sunday.48

Competition for scarce water led to disputes. William Ottey joined with 200 miners and broke down a dam that had been built to supply some puddling machines.49 After a while, the value of reprocessing tailings was realised. In the late 1850s, much of Ballarat was reworked with sluices. Many small dams, wooden flumes, and races were needed to catch and settle sludge from processing, particu larly by puddling machines. So much mud was produced that it raised the level of Ballarat’s busy Main Street by 11 ft (over 3 m). In 1855, Bendigo’s mining court began to hear claims for compensation for sludge swamping claims downstream.50 
At Bendigo and Castlemaine, quartz outcrops impregnated with gold fasci nated the miners for at first they could not see how to extract it. In 1854 W. Gaulton started work on the quartz, breaking it with handheld hammers. Within a short time, the first crushing mills were established, even then it was very difficult and some experimented with burning the quartz first. In turn, this new technology would require even more water and timber for its steam boilers.51

The goldfield had an almighty thirst for water. Almost immediately, natural sources were found to be inadequate for constant processing. Miners could either stockpile wash dirt and wait for rain, or seek more expensive supplies, constructing dams or races. This shortage of water meant that hydraulic sluicing would never be on a similar scale to California. At Bendigo, where the creeks were only seasonally intermittent, the debate over how best to construct a permanent supply began as early as 1854.52 Eventually, this was to become the key political issue of the region, leading to the colonial government building the Coliban water supply scheme. 
TIMBER CUTTING 
In a well-known passage, Howitt commented that 
The diggers seem to have two especial properties, those of firing guns and felling trees. It is amazing the number of trees they fell. No sooner have they done their day’s work than they commence felling trees.53 
The miners needed wood for many purposes. Sundays were devoted to cutting trees for firewood. Shafts required timber supports. In less than two months in 1854, Fauchery and party cut down 21 large trees for timbering shaft, just over one every three days. Eugene von Guerard felled four of five trees just to get a few decent planks. Before cutting them, he could not tell if they would be suitable, and in the end, none would split straight. Good timber became so valuable that slabs were carefully removed from abandoned shafts to be reused.54 
The result was wholesale clearing of the forests. Howitt recorded that at Bendigo, ‘little more than a year ago, the whole of this valley on the Bendigo Creek, seven miles [11 km] by one and a half [2.5 km] wide, was an unbroken wood! It is now perfectly bare of trees’. At Yackandandah, ‘whole miles of its banks that a year ago were wild and desolate, shrouded in dense thickets of tea-trees and wattles and lightwood, and thick with sedge and jungle, are now but heaps of clay; the trees prostrate, the whole scene laid bare’.55 
EATING, SHOOTING, AND WASTE 
The hard physical work of gold mining demanded a high-calorie diet. The standard fare was huge amounts of meat (mainly sheep) and bread. Up to the mid-1850s, agriculture receded as labour and capital was attracted to gold.

Victorian gold rushes 85 
The Victorian wheat acreage of 1854–55 was less than half of what it had been in 1850–51 despite the population more than trebling over that period. The shortfall was met by imports from overseas and other colonies. From the mid-1850s onwards, agriculture expanded dramatically as had occurred in California. The area under crops in Victoria rose from only 22,000 ha in 1854–55 to 157,000 in 1860–61, with wheat increasing nearly thirteen-fold. While sheep numbers remained constant, there was strong growth in dairy cattle and pigs. Around the goldfields, belts of small farms grew up to provide fresh produce. By 1859, there were 20,000 ha under cultivation around Ballarat. However, much of the new agricultural land was not adjacent to the goldfields, and this led to strong demand for carting services. This, in turn, further increased demand for fodder.56 
Local wildlife was fair game. The miners opportunistically shot kangaroos, possums, cockatoos, and parrots. Their dogs also killed ‘immense numbers’. Sunday, a rest day on which mining was illegal, was utilised for hunting. Partly, the carnage was for supplementary food, but it was also an expression of frontier freedom and bravado.57 They were also fearful of the exotic, shooting every goanna and snake they saw, thinking them all poisonous.58 The effect was that soon game was rare and the miners were beset by plagues of flies and English mice.59 
Victorian delicacy meant that written comments about waste were rare, but a few provide a flavour of the problem. Henry Leversha and his mates decided to work an abandoned shaft that had 2 ft (0.6 m) of water and night soil. They tossed a coin to see who would empty it, and the one carrying the buckets got drunk in order to stand the smell. Other holes were convenient repositories of other wastes. Butcher’s tents were ‘stinking of course’, there were ‘horrid stenches from butch ers’ shops and holes into which they have flung their garbage’ and one deep pool contained thousands of empty bottles.60 The systematic contamination of drinking supplies meant that the goldfields were regularly susceptible to serious epidemics of waterborne diseases.61 
BUILDING 
For the first few years, dwellings and shops were tents and huts of timber slabs and bark. In the uncertainty of the early rushes, they were conveniently portable or

required little investment. In time, more permanent materials began to be used, including unworked stone and mud bricks. A common practice was to build a hut with a stone chimney and stone walls up to about a metre high and then top that with a timber framed pitched roof. The rough stones were gathered from gullies, both providing building materials and clearing spaces to dig. Today, the regrowth forests of the Castlemaine Diggings National Heritage Park contain the ruins of hundreds of these stone huts. 
A turning point for building activity was reached in 1854. Confidence that gold would last encouraged an expansion of agriculture and towns developed an air of permanence. Laid out on non-auriferous ground, these towns had grid street plans and performed commercial and administrative functions. Government services seemed to have been the catalyst. At Castlemaine, there were over 300 staff in the Gold Commissioner’s Camp, and at Ballarat, there were 230. These included not just police and officials, but a wide range of servants, stablehands, cooks, and timber cutters.62 Around them sprung up stores and banks. While they serviced a floating population, they found there were advantages in having secure and stable premises. 
Government structures, including courts, post offices, and gaols, were built of stone or brick and were intended to be solid and impressive markers of authority. In 1852, Castlemaine opened a police station and courthouse and by 1857, had a stone prison and was on to its second courthouse. At Beechworth, a row of granite offices was constructed in 1857 and 1858, including a court, police station, telegraph, and Chinese protector’s office. Rather than being opportunistically collected rough stone, the granite was specifically quarried and carefully dressed. Experienced stonemasons found that wealth lay in following their trade rather than competing for gold on the diggings. All three buildings at Castlemaine survived and are on the Victorian Heritage Register. The government offices in Beechworth were restored in 2001 as part of the Centenary of Federation.63 
The scale and pattern of urbanisation was one of the most striking features of the Victorian gold rushes. By 1855, several large towns had been established, and their citizens expected them to be permanent and keep growing. The Miner’s Right, introduced in 1855, allowed miners to have a quarter acre block for a house and a garden. The cost was only £1 per year, under half a week’s wages, and validated the miners as settlers rather than sojourners or transients.64 This was a contrast to the situation in California, where mining settlements were smaller and miners tended to winter in Sacramento and Stockton, avoiding the snow and building up supplies. None of the Californian gold towns, such as Grass Valley or Nevada City, were as big as Bendigo, Ballarat, or Castlemaine.65

CONTEMPLATING 
While primarily concerned with finding gold, some miners had time to pause and contemplate the environment. This had none of the physical qualities of the other activities considered but may be considered as a consequence of those activities. Reflection is a human action and I have chosen to include it within my framework of activities. 
Walter Wilson had only been in Australia for a few days when he set out for the diggings: 
Carrying our swags was new to us all, and our camping at nights or bathing in the waterholes . . . was very enjoyable; while every object of interest had to be inspected; trees, rocks, ants and birds were a great source of interest as we trudged along.66 
Chandler recorded similar thoughts: 
I saw one of the most beautiful sights imaginable. It was a gentle slope running down to a clear stream, and was dotted with honeysuckle and she-oaks . . . the heath was out in full bloom . . . It was a most glorious sight, and the mountain air so fresh and sweet. I never saw a garden to equal it, so had to stop my team and admire it.67 
Paradoxically, the miners slaughtered native animals but also viewed them as symbols of their new life. In 1851, over 10,000 miners protested at high licence fees at a meeting near Castlemaine. On their flags, they chose to include both the kangaroo and emu. While trees were rapidly felled, some exceptionally large and mature specimens were spared, as in the still existing Big Tree at Guildford and the But But Tree at Beechworth.68 
From this appreciation of nature, it was only a short step to contemplating environmental damage. On several occasions, Howitt recorded that the gold rushes were directly responsible for destroying the natural environment.69 Even in this short period, some began to have thoughts of what would happen in the future. In 1855, the Mount Alexander Mail noted a trend towards quartz mining, which used large numbers of trees for fuel: 
It is earnestly to be hoped that before the chimneys of boilers have become very numerous, some method of dispensing with so much fire will have been fallen on, or in a few years the wood crowned summits of our hills will look as desolate and barren as the flats and gullies do already.70 
In time, the destructiveness of gold would generate public policy that would at least attempt conservation. In 1862, the Victorian government began creating a series of timber and firewood reserves in the goldfields, some of which would eventually become national parks. An interest in environmental reform would

characterise both Victoria and California.71 The exemplar of the miner/ conservationist was California’s Frederick Law Olmsted. In 1863, he was appointed manager of the Mariposa Mine, which he unsuccessfully tried to run as a modern and efficient business. Grasping the opportunity, he became a regular visitor to nearby Yosemite, becoming involved in its 1864 declaration as a park and serving as the first Head of the Yosemite Commission.72 
CONCLUSION 
The Victorian gold rushes that began in 1851 delivered a severe environmental shock, as did those that occurred in other regions. In a short space of time, hundreds of thousands of miners flooded in and transformed the environment. In the previous 15 years, pastoralism had also wrought major changes, but what the miners did was far more significant. Whereas the squatters sought grass for sheep, the miners removed the grass, trees, and topsoil and dug below. The squatters sought to control water sources for their sheep, while the miners’ demand far outstripped supply and they began a process of reshaping and damming water courses. The extensive diggings were quickly transformed from open woodlands to what was described as graveyards and gravel pits, the earth turned upside down and in chaos, the trees all gone, the earth barren and muddy. Much attention has focused on the social and economic upheaval caused by the gold rushes, but there was also a rapid and dramatic environmental revolution. 
Those who observed and recorded the gold rushes were conscious that they were seeing something unusual happening to the environment. Just as they recorded the contrast between wealthy diggers on a spree and those with no luck, they took trouble to record their impressions of environmental change. They knew that their potential audience would find it difficult to conceive of a world experiencing such changes. They were acutely aware that they were in a special moment in history and the importance of recording it. What is striking is how the various writers and artists consistently recorded very similar observations of envi ronmental change. 
The processes and changes that were occurring in the first five years of the Victorian gold rushes illustrate some of the central tenets of environmental history. McNeill’s three jostling types – material, cultural, and policy – were all in evidence. MacKenzie’s suggested fourth approach – apocalyptic – could also be easily applied, for in certain areas there was a rapid and extensive destruction of the previously existing ecosystem. Indeed, it is not difficult to apply this apoca lyptic vision as the overriding characteristic of this and many other mining booms. Finally, Worster’s perspective is particularly important. That the gold rushes led to major economic and social changes has been widely examined for many years;

taking Worster’s lead, it is important to also consider how gold reorganised the natural environment as well. This period saw the establishment of deeply embed ded attitudes towards the systematic ‘mining’ of natural resources, which would continue to dominate Australian primary industries for centuries. 
The first five years after 1851 was a radical shock that set a pattern for understanding both the later Australian gold rushes and those in other countries. The series of activities considered here were common to all gold rushes and so form an analytical framework for considering later periods. The problems that arose for the first miners, such as adaptation to a new environment, a differing balance of the factors of production to their home economies, and the control and wise use of scarce water and timber, would reappear.
