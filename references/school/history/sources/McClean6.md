CHAPTER 6 
Depression, Drought, and Federation 
A wilful, lavish land. 
— Dorothea Mackellar1 
The long boom that began in the 1850s came to an end in the early 1890s. And  the slump that followed was both deep and protracted. Indeed, per capita real  GDP fell by 22 percent by 1895 and did not regain its 1889 peak for a full two  decades— until 1909 (fi gure 6.1). To give this context, both the extent of the fall  in incomes, and the number of years that elapsed before the previous peak was  regained, were greater than that which occurred during the depression of the  interwar period (when they were 18 percent and thirteen years, respectively).  Explaining why this stunning reversal of fortune occurred aft er 1890 is the cen tral task in this chapter.2 
Th e approach adopted here includes a comparative perspective on Austra lians’ reduced levels of prosperity between 1890 and 1914. As we saw in chap ter 2, Australia recorded the highest per capita income in the world for some  period prior to the 1890s. Th is achievement has never been repeated. In this  inquiry into Australian prosperity and its determinants, it therefore is crucial  to explain how this ranking in per capita income was lost aft er 1890. Unsurpris ingly, it turns out that the reasons overlap with those accounting for why the  high incomes, relative to other countries, were attained in the fi rst place, a topic  not directly addressed in the previous chapter. 
Explaining Relative Incomes 
Recent analyses of the Australian lead in incomes prior to 1890 have focused  on several possible contributing factors.3 One is that there was something un usual about the composition of the Australian population at the time that

Alternative estimates  have been proposed by Haig (2001), but to date these have not been assessed as clearly superior: see  Maddison (2003, pp. 72– 73), Broadberry and Irwin (2007, pp. 263– 64; 2008), and Haig (2008). 3 Th e following discussion draws on Broadberry and Irwin (2007), Irwin (2007), and McLean (2007).

boosted measured GDP relative to that of the two benchmark economies, the  United Kingdom and the United States. We have noted the role of economic demographic interactions within the Australian economy following the pop ulation shock accompanying the gold rushes. And it appears that the higher  masculinity rates resulting from the same event may have led to a higher pro portion of the population participating in the workforce (since males partici pate more than females), and hence producing more output than would have  been the case had the gender balance been closer to the norm. However, the  overall (male plus female) workforce participation rate, though higher in Aus tralia than in the United States, was below that in the United Kingdom. Th us in  a comparison with the United States, about half the income superiority of Aus tralia over the United States in 1890 can be attributed to these demographic and  labor- market characteristics. In a formal sense, the remaining and unexplained  half must be due to higher labor productivity— GDP per person employed. In  the case of the comparison with the United Kingdom, all the income superior ity must come from this latter source. 
Any comparison of labor productivity between the three countries has to take  into account both the diff erences between them in productivity levels across  particular industries or sectors, and the diff erences in the relative importance  of these sectors within each country, economy- wide productivity being the av 
erage of that in each industry weighted by its share of total employment. Th e  evidence suggests that the source of Australia’s productivity superiority over both  the United Kingdom and the United States prior to the 1890s arises in the two  natural- resource- intensive sectors of agriculture and mining. With respect to  
Depression, Drought, Federation • 115 
agriculture, the level of labor productivity in Australia in the 1880s was over  twice that in the United Kingdom, which was in turn about comparable with  that in the United States. Similarly in mining, Australia had almost a threefold  lead over the United Kingdom in labor productivity. Of course, the importance  of these sectors in the three economies diff ered, and thus their contribution  to economy- wide productivity levels did too. Th e United States had a much  higher proportion of its labor force in its less effi cient agriculture than did Aus tralia, whereas the share of employment in U.K. agriculture was somewhat less  than the Australian share. Diff erences between the three countries in their pro 
ductivity levels and shares of employment in other industries or sectors do not  appear to contribute signifi cantly to the explanation of the Australian lead in  overall levels of labor productivity. 
It can be concluded that, relative to the United States, the higher prosperity  Australians enjoyed at this time had its proximate origins in part in its higher  masculinity rate and workforce participation rate, and in part in the higher  level of labor productivity in the farming and mining sectors. When the com 
parison is made with the United Kingdom, the much higher labor productivity  in the same two natural- resource- intensive sectors in Australia accounts for its  superior levels of income, though in this case the higher U.K. workforce partici 
pation rate partly off sets the Australian advantage in productivity.4 Th e attention devoted in the previous chapter to the long- run demographic  implications of the gold rushes, and in the previous two chapters to the sources  of effi ciency in the pastoral and agricultural sectors, was motivated in substan tial part because of this comparative analysis: they were key determinants of  Australia’s relatively high level of economic prosperity in the nineteenth cen tury. Th is has been an important fi nding derived from the eff ort to benchmark  Australian income per capita against that of the United Kingdom and the United  States, and the attempt to account for the Australian superiority over both. Look ing ahead, I will return in chapter 9 to review attempts to benchmark Australia’s  productivity performance since the 1960s against the United States in particular,  but with the advantage of more comprehensive data of higher quality. In this and the previous chapter, I have examined several sources of the eco nomic prosperity recorded in Australia in the decades between 1850 and 1890.  But this has not been an exhaustive inquiry given the many possible contribut ing sources canvassed in chapter 2. It should also be noted that highlighting  the especially favorable international economic conditions Australia faced dur ing these decades, and the impressive productivity performance achieved in  the resource- based export industries, is not novel. So, what other sources of  prosperity at this time might have had a major role to play? Two that fi gure  prominently in growth theory probably were not so unusual as to account for

the Australian lead in living standards at this time. Th ere is no evidence to  support the view that labor productivity in Australia was higher than that in  the United Kingdom or the United States because there was a greater stock of  capital available to each worker. Capital stock estimates that would make pos 
sible a direct estimate are not available, but evidence of investment rates do  not suggest Australians were accumulating capital at unusually high rates. If  physical capital per worker seems not to be a source of Australia’s relatively high  productivity, might it be that the accumulation of human capital was greater—  that is, per worker? A discussion of human capital— especially education— in  Australian growth will be deferred until we assess the economy’s performance  in the twentieth century. For now it is suffi cient to note that there appears lit 
tle diff erence between Australian and U.S. rates of elementary schooling in the  late nineteenth century, at a time when this level of education was probably  more important to growth than the higher levels (high school, university) that  later assumed much greater signifi cance. However, there is one source of mea 
sured growth that warrants consideration. Very little attention is accorded in  the Australian literature to the possibility that the prosperity Australians en joyed before 1890 may to some extent have been inherently transitory because  the conventional methods of measuring GDP do not adjust for any of the re source depletion that was occurring at this time in farming or mining. 
Eating the Seed Corn? 
It is possible for an economy temporarily to attain higher levels of income and  consumption than is sustainable in the long run by running down its stock of  natural resources. Th at is, the levels of productivity and hence income attained  in the late nineteenth century may have been based to some extent on an un 
sustainable rate of depletion of nonrenewable resources such as mineral de posits, and/or an unsustainable rate of exhaustion of renewable resources such  as pastoral and agricultural land. Gold provides a clear case of the former. Th e  discoveries of the 1850s and later were extracted at a rate that maximized cur rent profi tability in the gold- mining industry. When the deposits were mined  out, or yields declined below economic levels, the mine closed and production  ceased. In the case of rural land, if pioneer farming practices were lowering  yields through overcropping (“soil- mining” is the appropriate term in this con text), then output was higher than could be sustained without some change in  farming practices, changes that likely lowered output and/or productivity in the  short- to medium term. Th is is an intuitive exposition of what might be meant  by an unsustainable level of output or income pre- 1890. 
Economists have tried to sharpen the discussion of what is a sustainable  use of natural resources. One approach is to focus on what is done with the  income (rent) generated from exploiting a nonrenewable resource. If it is all 
Depression, Drought, Federation • 117 
spent on current consumption, this will be boosted in the short run, but will  decline if the rate of resource extraction falters, and return to its initial level  if the resource is fully depleted. Th e higher consumption level was inherently  temporary. However, if a portion of the additional income obtained by exploit 
ing the resource is saved rather than consumed, and invested in an asset that  is expected to yield income in perpetuity (government bonds, for example),  a higher level of consumption can be maintained beyond the point at which  the resource is depleted.5 Th is, aft er all, is the idea behind the sovereign wealth  funds of resource- rich nations such as Norway or the Gulf states today: how to  maintain incomes and consumption aft er the oil and gas reserves have run out. 
Turning from theory to history, the question is whether, around 1890, Aus tralians were consuming too much of the rent from the resource extraction,  and investing too little in alternative productive assets, in order to maintain  incomes in the long run. Put diff erently, in 1890 how much of Australia’s GDP  per capita, and consumption per capita, might have been “unsustainable” in  this sense? If this was signifi cant, Australians had been bringing forward their  consumption of the bounty of the natural resources they had discovered with 
out making full provision for the maintenance of their standards of living. Th ey  had perhaps been, to some degree, “future eaters,” in the colorful phrase of a  recent writer on environmental sustainability.6 
Gold is a nonrenewable resource, hence each ounce mined, minted and ex ported in exchange for imports was one less ounce available in the future. In  this “quarry” economy perspective, the gold rush represented a rapid exploita tion of the community’s stock of gold and its conversion into current income  and expenditure— including primarily on current consumption. Th e choice of  present versus future income becomes more complex where the resource in  question is of an unknown size, or where future resource discoveries are un certain with respect to both their timing and value. For example, in any year  following 1851, it was not known how much gold remained to be discovered  and mined. Th e gold discoveries in Western Australia in the 1890s illustrate  the diffi culty in drawing strong conclusions about whether gold production  in earlier decades had temporarily supported “unsustainable” levels of income  and consumption.7 
In contrast to mineral deposits, rural land is a renewable natural resource. It  may be depleted, such as through overcropping, leading to a decline in its fertility  
5 Indeed, there will be some rate of deferred consumption (saving) from the additional income  that will provide a future income stream from the alternative investments such as to maintain  consumption levels beyond the depletion of the resource, and do so indefi nitely. 6 Th e reference is to Flannery (1994). 
7 I ignore here the role of technological change in determining the extent to which the stock of  a particular resource is (economically) recoverable; and the related possibility that the natural resource endowment is to some degree endogenous to the level of development of an economy, a  topic I turn to in the next chapter.

or livestock- carrying capacity. Th us in the short run, farm output may be in creased above the level that can be sustained in the long run. Given the impor tance of the rural sector in the economy at the time, this in turn would lead  to a temporary higher level of income. But in contrast to mining activity, the  
productivity of rural land can be replenished, albeit at some cost. Th e evidence typically used to support the view that rural production meth ods during these decades were depleting soil fertility is the decline in average crop yields during the decades in which (especially wheat) acreage greatly in creased. Th is may have been pronounced in the early years of rural occupation  of a region, when little was known about the management practices necessary  in each locality to avoid declining yields. It is also possible that the fi nancial  and “improvement” conditions imposed on selectors under the land acts of the  1860s and 1870s encouraged soil- mining practices. In this case public policy  operated at cross purposes, supporting maximum access to land by small farm ers, but providing incentives for them to adopt a short- term revenue maximiza tion goal instead of a long- term viability objective— fi nancially and ecologically. However, this evidence has to be treated cautiously, as average yields of a  given crop in a colony can be shown to have declined in part because the loca tion of crop production was shift ing to regions with lower rainfall or poorer  quality soils, and hence lower yields were recorded for these reasons. Even  within a given region or county, yields may fall for reasons other than over cropping.8 We noted in the previous chapter that even before 1890, established  farmers were observing adverse consequences to their own behaviors. Realizing  they were depleting their resource base, they adjusted their product mix, ad opted new technology and farm management practices, and turned to govern ments for assistance where collective action was necessary. For example, the  Australia- wide average yields of wheat began to rise aft er reaching a nadir dur ing the 1890s. 
To have avoided soil degradation would have required a slower growth in  rural settlement and output and/or a higher cost structure to farming from the  outset. Th e result would have been lower farm incomes and productivity dur ing this pioneering phase. How much lower is not clear. But it seems safe to sug gest that the levels of farm output and labor productivity achieved in Australia  before the 1890s were to some degree based on the depletion of rural land fertil ity. Th is in turn suggests that some component of Australian average incomes  was likewise based. 
It should not be overlooked that in each of the other high- income settler  economies in the latter half of the nineteenth century— Canada, New Zealand,  the United States and Argentina— natural resources played an important role  
8 For example, if the best land was brought into production fi rst. Frost (1995) argues against  the uncritical acceptance of declining yields as a measure of soil- mining practices by Victoria’s   farmers.

in their development and prosperity. Hence, before it can be suggested that  Australia’s relative income ranking might be sensitive to its unsustainable re source depletion, a similar exercise on any comparator country would have to  be undertaken. 
Nor should it be assumed that the evidence of declining soil fertility at this  time of itself implies socially suboptimal decision- making by farmers; that is,  decisions not in society’s long- term interest. Some commentators on resource  and environmental history overlook the extent to which Australia’s pioneer  farmers could only learn the characteristics of their land by using it. Further,  even from hindsight it is not clear that a slower expansion of rural occupation  and development, with a greater investment in higher- cost sustainable farming  practices from the outset, would have produced a higher level of social welfare,  though this is implied by some writers. Tricky assumptions about the welfare of  diff erent generations— some of whom would lose, some gain— are implicit in  any such counterfactual. 
Boom, Bubble, and Bust: A Classic Debt Crisis 
With hindsight, it is easy to be wise in observing that the long nineteenth- century  economic boom eventually acquired characteristics that imperiled its continu ation. If contemporaries could confi dently have foreseen this, one imagines that  whether pastoralist, house buyer, banker, or politician, they would have acted  diff erently. For their part, historians have, if anything, overdetermined their  explanations of the crash of the early 1890s.9 Th e list of suspects in the crime is  long, but diff erent investigators have lists that only partially overlap. Identifying  the key elements among the many plausible contributing factors requires the  assistance of a particular model, approach, or perspective. Th at adopted here is  the one most commonly employed to analyze debt crises in small, open, devel 
oping economies, since the boom and bust in late- nineteenth- century Australia  has much in common with these all- too frequent events. 
Th e pastoral occupation of inland Australia would eventually encounter its  geographical limits, and in southeastern Australia, this appears to have oc curred by 1890, at least temporarily. But of itself, this need not have precipitated  an economic crisis. As we have seen in the previous chapter, the application  of new technology and improved management methods permitted increases  in output on inframarginal farms. Encountering the geographic limits of rural  occupation may, however, have increased the cost of additional production rela tive to when this additional production was achieved by moving out the fron tier of rural settlement. But this may not have been apparent to contemporaries,  at least immediately. Th at is, there may have been an element in the expected

profi tability of the pastoral industry in the 1880s that relied on its continued  low- cost geographical expansion. As already noted, the frontier occupation of  farmlands was also a process of acquiring relevant information about the suit ability of the area in question for rural development, as it was diffi cult, if not  impossible, to acquire this information prior to making the initial investments  in land and livestock. 
Rapid expansion was also elevating risk in the urban sector. High levels of  immigration, combined with the “echo eff ect” of the gold- rush- induced kink to  the age distribution, created strong demand for residential construction as well  as ancillary urban infrastructure such as tramways, suburban rail lines, and  water and sewerage systems. Th e urban construction boom is most famously  associated with Melbourne in the 1880s. Supplying much of this infrastructure  fell to the government sector, which fi nanced its spending in large part with  foreign borrowing. Although there was nothing inherently unsound in such a  debt- fi nanced urban expansion, the dangers lay in the levels and forms of the  borrowing. Th e social overhead capital that was created would not immediately  generate suffi cient revenue to fully service the loans, and the fact that it was not  private sector but colonial government borrowing (and investment) meant that  any failed project would directly and negatively impact public fi nances. Private  developers could go bankrupt, but the colonial governments could not so eas ily default on their debts. Hence any misdirected public investment would be a  burden on future taxpayers. 
Th ere are many ways to illustrate the run- up in debt that accompanied the  boom. One is to cumulate the current account defi cits that were a persistent  feature of the decades before 1890, thereby obtaining a rough indicator of total  foreign debt exposure: according to one recent estimate, this rose from a trivial  proportion of GDP before 1861 to over 100 percent by the end of the boom,  then, as GDP fell with the ensuing slump, the ratio climbed above 150 percent.10  A more conventional indicator is the level of government debt (fi gure 5.3). Th is,  too, was very low at the beginning of the boom, at a mere 3 percent of GDP in  1855, but rose rapidly thereaft er to reach 71 percent by 1890, peaking during  the depressed decade that followed at 123 percent in 1895. 
Th e fi nancial sector also grew rapidly, providing the conduit linking savers  with borrowers. Critical to the sound allocation of these funds among compet ing projects by the bankers and other intermediaries was their knowledge of the  risks and returns to which lenders were to be exposed. Also critical for fi nan cial stability were the institutional checks and balances both within fi nancial  institutions and across the fi nancial sector. However the rapid growth in the  sector led to a scarcity of bankers with relevant experience, especially of rural  Australia. It led also to a proliferation of numerous small banks with limited

diversifi cation in their investment portfolios, whether across asset types or by  colony. And this rapid growth occurred in a regulatory regime that was very  laissez- faire. Th is was a fi nance sector with the potential for a serious decline in  prudential standards.11 
Th e high level of investment that characterized the long boom was the re sult of decisions taken both in the public and private sectors, and fi nanced  both from domestic and British sources. An important issue is thus whether  there was serious misallocation of this investment. Related questions include  whether any such misallocation was primarily due to government decisions or  those made by market agents, and whether any such tendencies were clearest in  the 1880s when the boom in asset prices peaked.12 With respect to the run- up in  public- sector debt, some attempts have been made to evaluate the investment  decisions of the colonial governments. Of particular interest has been the case  of railway construction, oft en subject to the assessment (both at the time and by  historians) that lines were built with political rather than economic consider 
ations uppermost, or that there was wasteful construction due to intercolonial  rivalry— especially between New South Wales and Victoria to service the trans port needs of the Riverina region on their common border. Th e evidence does  not support an unqualifi ed judgment of sustained or substantial misallocation  of investment in railways, though debate continues.13 And any assessment has  to ask whether a better allocation could have been made with the information  
available to the decision- makers, or only with the advantage of hindsight. At the level of the macro- economy, the potential for crisis lay in any sud den and signifi cant change in the key elements supporting growth previously  enumerated: the infl ow of foreign capital that augmented domestic savings and  fi nanced about 40 percent of domestic investment; the ability of colonial gov ernments to service their rapidly growing foreign debt; and the rate of immi gration, which was underpinning the urban construction boom. To illustrate  this vulnerability, fi gure 6.2 shows the proportion of export earnings required  in each year to service the existing debts held abroad. Th e run- up in this debt servicing burden prior to 1890, and most rapidly during the 1880s, is striking.  Only in the depth of the depression of the 1930s was this level of debt burden  briefl y exceeded. 
In the early 1890s all these props were fractured. Th e London capital market  became increasingly concerned about the expected returns on further lending  to Australia, at least partly in reaction to events in Argentina (the Barings crisis  of 1890). Th is is the contagion eff ect, familiar from recent fi nancial crises such  as those among Asian economies in 1997. And the popping of a speculative

12 Th e weakening of investment criteria is a theme central to the analysis of Butlin (1964). 13 See, for example, Davidson (1982) and Frost (2000).

bubble in land and housing in Victoria led to a crisis in the fi nancial sector in  1893 with the collapse or temporary closure of many banks leading, in turn, to  the loss or freezing of deposits and a decline in lending. Growth there slowed,  reducing colonial government revenues, thereby restricting Victoria’s capacity  to continue funding high levels of public investment in infrastructure and fur 
ther slowing domestic economic activity. Th e downturn in economic prospects  in the colonies more generally (with the exception of Western Australia) at fi rst  slowed the rate of immigration, thus compounding the negative demand forces  in their economies, then led to a complete drying- up of immigration as the  depression deepened. 
Th e complex interaction between these internal and foreign sources of the  boom bedevils any neat attribution of the causes of the bust that followed. As  with most complex macroeconomic events, simple explanations are rarely per suasive. Th e weakening of investment criteria by pastoralists, governments,  and others is part of the story, but begs the question what changed investors’  attitudes toward risk in the 1880s. We now have a better appreciation of the  dynamic role of expectations during asset price bubbles, yet they recur because

each generation seems to think this time it is a sustainable run- up in the value  of land, houses, and shares.14 Th e event that changed the psychological under pinnings of the 1880s bubble may have been the reconsideration by British in vestors following the Barings crisis of the risk of further lending to colonial  governments. Th is led to a reduction in colonial loans raised on the London  capital market. But the vulnerability of the Victorian economy in particular to  any slowdown in foreign investment was entirely the result of prior borrow ing decisions made in the colony. Th e drastic reduction in government spend ing that occurred in Victoria in the 1890s (described below) illustrates this  vulnerability— albeit aft er the event. 
Th ere are at least two interesting questions about this particular boom and  bust that seem central to the analysis of long- run growth and prosperity in  Australia. First, was the bust avoidable, or could it have been greatly attenu ated? Second, were the gains or benefi ts of the boom suffi cient to outweigh the  losses or costs of the ensuing bust? With respect to the fi rst question, the issue  is under what conditions sustainable growth could have continued through  the 1890s. Had growth in the 1880s proceeded at a lower rate, with smaller  infl ows of immigrants and foreign capital, and a slower extension of the area  under pastoral occupation, there would have occurred a correspondingly  slower run- up in public debt and in the value of assets such as land and hous 
ing. And perhaps a slower rate of pastoral expansion would have resulted in a  more sustainable occupation of marginal lands. But some major adjustments  in the colonial economy toward the end of the century would still have oc curred. International commodity prices would still have declined until the  mid- 1890s. Th e demographic echo eff ect from the gold rushes would still have  run its course. Th e Barings crisis would still have triggered a reassessment of  the growth prospects of the Australian colonies resulting in a lowering of the  expected risk- adjusted returns on further investment there by British lenders.  And the droughts that set in during the 1890s would still have delivered a seri 
ous blow to rural prosperity. Furthermore, with no national government, there  was no institutional framework within which a coordinated tweaking of the  growth strategies of the individual colonies could occur. Indeed, a central ele-  ment in the pre- 1890s boom was their competitive pursuit of rapid growth  in their populations and economies. Perhaps intercolonial rivalry became a  negative- sum game to the extent that it encouraged high- risk behavior in the  private sector and unproductive public- sector investment. 
Backing off from such counterfactual speculation, we may still ask whether  the boom was, in some sense, worth it. Th e assessment of historians is that the  1890s depression was a social and economic disaster. But disaster avoidance

comes at a cost. Put diff erently, who gained and who lost from what hap pened? In one perspective, the costs and benefi ts were borne by diff erent gen erations of Australians. Th ose whose adult lives spanned the 1850s to the  1880s gained most from four decades of prosperity. Someone who arrived at  working age (say, age fi ft een) in 1889 enjoyed the fruits of prosperity only as  a child. Th ereaft er, unemployment increased and, as is clear from fi gure 6.1,  per capita incomes were little higher in 1914 (by which time this individual  would be age forty) than in 1890, and for most of the intervening years were  below it, with both the higher unemployment and reduced living standards  due in some measure to the negative consequences of the boom— or at least  its fi nal stages. 
Shift ing our attention from the experience of diff erent age cohorts to that of the  macro- economy, many historians have implicitly assumed that there were “ex cesses” of the pre- 1890 boom that are identifi able simply because of the crash  that followed. But this is post hoc reasoning. First, as just suggested, there are  benefi ciaries of a boom despite its having acquired speculative attributes. Also,  in the wake of recent experience, we are now more circumspect in assuming  either that the speculative element in asset prices could have been identifi ed ex  ante, or that feasible policies could have been adopted that would have avoided  both the excesses of the boom and the resulting crash. If there exists a strategy  for ensuring sustained rapid growth without risk of major crises and hence  interruptions to prosperity, then we have yet to discover it. Even the most suc 
cessful developing countries over the last half century or so have witnessed pe riodic booms, crises, or busts. It may be that rapidly developing settler economies  were even more likely to experience periodic major interruptions to their growth.  Th e high but variable rate of immigration added to this inherent instability—  because of the economic- demographic interactions previously described. And  the lack of information about the economy’s resource base was a further de stabilizing feature, as its characteristics were established primarily through the  inherently speculative investment necessary to occupy the frontier and tap its  resources, whether via pioneer farming or mining. 
Th e economic crisis of the 1890s thus has many of the traits of the economic  and fi nancial crises that pepper the history of the international economy. But  there is one further feature of the Australian crisis that warrants mention: It  was not uniformly felt across the colonies. Th e epicenter was Victoria. In con 
trast, the very small colony of Western Australia was to enjoy a boom in the  1890s— courtesy of the gold discoveries there. And it should also be noted that  the seventh Australasian colony had experienced its debt crisis in the 1880s  following a borrowing boom in the 1870s. Hence New Zealand was in recovery  mode, strongly so aft er 1895 when international commodity prices rose. Th is  is critical context to any understanding of the decision by New Zealand not to  join the federation at the end of the decade.

Th ere were economic downturns, recessions, and/or fi nancial crises in a number  of economies in the early 1890s, hence the Australian experience invites com parison with them. I have already noted, and shortly will return to, the case of Ar gentina. In the United States a major fi nancial panic occurred in 1893, and the  associated downturn there is sometimes referred to as a depression. More gener ally, the fi rst half of the 1890s saw a continuation of a downward trend in in ternational commodity prices that had set in around 1873 and was to continue  until they turned up following 1895. In British agricultural history, this was  long known as the “great depression.” Indeed, throughout much of Europe this  period was associated with falling rural incomes, the importation of new- world  grains, and mass rural migration to the cities and also overseas to the settler  economies, especially the United States. Th e fi rst globalization, from which  Australia, and especially its farmers, was a major benefi ciary, was wreaking  economic and social dislocation on the European countryside. And the mass  international migrations that occurred at this time refl ected the changing com parative advantage in (and hence location of) agricultural production as inter national trade in food and fi ber boomed.15 
From the mid- 1890s the long downward trend in commodity prices and as sociated gentle defl ation went into reverse. More broadly, the period from 1895  to 1914 was one of rapid growth and prosperity in the other settler economies—  Argentina, Canada, and New Zealand— each of which was highly integrated  into the international economy. Australian experience, however, was an excep tion. Th ere was no quick bounce- back from the crisis of the early 1890s. Th e  economic indicators do not show a sustained upward trend until about 1904.  Australia “lost” a decade of growth when viewed in comparative perspective.  And when growth did return, it was not suffi ciently robust during the decade  prior to the First World War to make up for its delayed onset. Th is is the only  extended period of its history when Australia’s domestic economy did not enjoy  prosperity during a boom in the international economy. 
Th e explanation for this anomaly in Australian experience can be approached  from a national or a comparative perspective, and I will do both. With respect  to the former, there is one major fact concerning the delayed recovery from the  1890s depression, and one major interpretation of it, and they both warrant  emphasis. Th e fact is the onset and persistence of what has become known as  the federation drought, which extended over much of the settled area of the  country for several years, reaching its peak early in the new century. Th is, I like  to imagine, is what the poet had in mind when choosing the adjective “wilful”

to qualify her description of Australia as “a lavish land”: she would have had  direct experience of both depression and drought having been born in Sydney  in 1885. 
Because prosperity at that time relied much more than it does now on the  fortunes of the rural sector, the prolonged run of poor seasons, coming on the  heels of the economic depression, had a major negative impact on the economy.  One dramatic statistic is that the number of sheep, which had peaked at 106  million in 1892, fell by half to 54 million in 1903: this suggests an economic  catastrophe. But, as always, statistics need careful handling. Not all of the re 
duction in the national fl ock was the result of low rainfall. Some of the decline  represented a rational disinvestment in pastoral assets (destocking) following  the speculative excesses of the 1880s. Th is was especially the case on the fron tier where the marginal climatic conditions for profi table wool- growing were  most savagely exposed. Since sheep in the arid zone had lower fl eece weights  of poorer quality, the average fl eece weight rose as the number of sheep de clined. Hence wool production— a more pertinent economic indicator than  sheep numbers— fell by only 36 per cent between its peak in 1892 and through  in 1902.16 
Th e diversifi cation of agricultural production that occurred during the pe riod covered by this chapter illustrates farmers’ adaptability in responding to  a sequence of shocks, fi nancial and climatic, that cushioned their economic  fortunes and thereby those of the country. Th e rise of “mixed” farming where  farmers combined sheep- raising with crop production had been occurring for  some time: the advantages of producing wool and wheat rather than one ex clusively were obvious to farmers as they adapted to fl uctuations in commod ity prices and climatic conditions. In the 1890s the diversifi cation of both ag ricultural output and exports accelerated. Critical to this diversifi cation was  the introduction of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s, permitting the export  of frozen meat (lamb and mutton) and of dairy products to the British market.  Th e frozen meat trade allowed the farmer to exploit the joint- product nature of  some breeds of sheep beyond the supply of fresh meat to the domestic market.  Also, for the fi rst time, Australia became a consistent net exporter of wheat. 
In order to assess more rigorously the contribution of the drought to the  delayed recovery requires an economic model that would chart the fortunes of  both the rural sector and the wider economy through the 1890s and beyond  under “normal” or average climatic conditions. Th e gap between the counter 
factual (that is, drought- adjusted) and actual GDP would then represent the  economic impact of the drought. Th is exercise has yet to be attempted. How ever a partial analysis of the topic has been undertaken, assessing the likely  path of rural sector output had there been average rainfall during the period.  Drought- adjusted rural production still falls, though only until 1896, indicat

ing that factors other than the climate negatively impinged on the farm sector  during these years.17 Th e general equilibrium eff ects on the aggregate economy  are far more diffi cult to measure. Because the drought persisted for several  years, economic agents adjusted in myriad ways to off set its negative impact,  so the net (but still negative) eff ect on the whole economy is likely to have been  less than that on those most directly aff ected— the farmers. Nonetheless, there  is no question that the federation drought placed a constraint on the recovery. 
Also warranting emphasis is an interpretation of the delayed recovery from  the 1890s depression, sometimes explicit, but mostly implicit in the literature,  according to which it was the result of the severity of the imbalances in the  economy that had accumulated prior to 1890 and that had to be corrected be 
fore sustainable growth and prosperity could return. I call this the “symmetry”  hypothesis, as it suggests that both the depth and the duration of the slump  were inversely related to the scale and seriousness of the preceding boom and  bubble. Since the boom was sustained and the bubble substantial, there should  be little surprise, from this perspective, that the subsequent slump was severe  and recovery slow. But this scarcely constitutes a persuasive analysis of the  causal economic mechanisms in play. Negative shocks can be followed by an  “asymmetric” bounce- back: consider, for example, the rapid recoveries in some  of the devastated economies following 1945, especially West Germany and  Japan. More generally, comparisons of recoveries from economic crises cover ing long spans of history have revealed complex forces at work.18 For example,  the presence of a fi nancial or banking collapse tends to attenuate recovery, and  just such a collapse occurred in Australia in the 1890s. 
Contributing to the slow recovery was the adjustment required in the bal ance sheets of households, fi rms (including banks), and colonial governments.  Th e end of the debt- fueled boom required what is now loosely described as  “deleveraging.” Households’ balance sheets were negatively impacted by the de cline in asset (house, land, and share) prices, and by bank collapses that resulted  in frozen deposits or their complete loss. At the same time, unemployment rose  and job security declined. Th e result was a desire by the household sector to  increase its savings rate so as to rebuild its capital losses, and also for precaution ary reasons given the deterioration in the labor market. It follows that the de sired savings rate would be above the actual rate applying prior to the slump. But  to raise their savings rate, households would have to cut consumption, and this  would negatively impact private demand. In the short run, with unemployment  
17 Th e modeling of rural sector output under conditions of normal rainfall is reported in Th e Impact of the 1895– 1903 Drought on Australian Rural Production, an unpublished honors thesis in  economics at the University of Adelaide in 1997 by Patrick James McDonald. Th e main fi ndings  are summarized in McLean (2006). 
18 A recent survey and analysis is reported by Rogoff and Reinhart (2009); however they give  limited attention to the Australian episode in the 1890s.

rising, there would be little scope to make this desired adjustment to household  fi nances. Rather, the deleveraging would mostly occur only when the slump  phase ended and gave way to the fi rst signs of recovery, but it would thereby  weaken that recovery.19 
A closely related infl uence was the virtual cessation of foreign investment.  In the 1880s boom, the savings of foreigners had fi nanced about 40 percent of  domestic investment. Th e drying up of capital infl ow in the following decade  could, in principle, have been off set by an increase in domestic saving, sustain 
ing domestic investment and thereby countering in some measure the other  negative pressures on economic activity. Indeed there is evidence that foreign  and domestic sources of fi nance for investment in Australia at this time moved  inversely— that is, capital infl ow was in part a substitute for domestic saving,  permitting higher levels of consumption to be sustained at any given level of in 
vestment.20 But following the economic and fi nancial crises in the early 1890s,  Australian households were in no position to off set the sharp fall in capital  infl ow by raising their savings rate. 
Neither were the colonial governments in a position to contribute to domes tic savings by moving into budget surpluses. Th ey experienced declining rev enues as economic activity slowed, but faced fi xed debt repayments, so defi cits  increased. Victoria was the most severely aff ected (fi gure 6.3). Modern macro economic theory and practice would prescribe that some increase in defi cit fi nanced public- sector stimulus to the economy might be warranted to off set the  collapse in private- sector investment and employment. Given its existing debt  levels and rising debt- servicing ratio, however, the Victorian government also  needed to deleverage, and in any event faced a less receptive London cap ital mar ket for further colonial issues. Hence there was some substitution of colonial is sues. But short of negotiating a rescheduling of its existing debt obligations— a  policy option apparently not contemplated but adopted elsewhere at this time,  as will shortly be described— there was no alternative but to cut recurrent govern ment spending. Th is, of course, worsened the slump and delayed the recovery.21 
Adopting a comparative perspective assists the explanation of the slow recov ery, and raises further doubts about the thesis that it may be regarded simply  as a consequence of the size of the problem to be corrected. In particular, the  Argentine experience is in many ways apposite. Th ese two settler economies  were at comparable stages in their development. Argentina had experienced  a resource- based boom prior to 1890 based on close trading and investment  
19 I further explore this mechanism in a comparative analysis of Australia, Canada, and the  United States: McLean (1994). 
20 Bentick (1969) analyzed the Victorian experience at this time in terms of the macroeconomic  relationships linking asset prices, private wealth, foreign borrowing, and the fi scal position of the  government. 
21 Th is, and the following comparative analysis, draws on the discussion in McLean (2006).

links with Britain, the expansion of rural settlement on the pampas and be yond, and an urban construction boom based on high levels of immigration  and centered in Buenos Aires. Broadly speaking the character and dimensions  of the booms in the two countries were similar, and the initial fi nancial crises  also appear to have had much in common. Indeed the comparability of the situ ation in the two explains why the contagion eff ect seems to have played a part  in the Australian story. Th e reaction of London- based lenders to the Barings  crisis in Argentina in 1890 was to re- rate the risk of investing further in the  Australian colonies. 
What the Argentine story suggests, however, is that it is possible to achieve a  rapid recovery from a severe crisis at the end of a long boom: the recovery need  neither be delayed nor slow. So, how did Argentina manage to recover so rapidly,  and from 1895 fully participate in the two decades of prosperity in the interna 
tional economy that ensued? One simple indicator of the divergence between  these two settler economies that occurred at this time— uncharacteristically in  Argentina’s favor— lies in their population growth (fi gure 6.4). In 1890 the pop ulations were similar: 3.2 million and 3.4 million for Australia and Argentina,  respectively. By 1913 the Australian population had reached 4.9 million, while  that in Argentina was 7.7 million, a fi gure Australia was not to attain until 1949. 
Th ere were two signifi cant policy responses to the crisis in Argentina not  undertaken (or feasible) in Australia, and one diff erence in their stage of rural  settlement, that may go far to account for the quick and vigorous bounce- back  in the former. Th e Argentine government secured a rescheduling of its debt

 obligations with its British creditors that both lowered the rates of interest  charged and lengthened the period of repayment. Th is is a standard maneuver  for a country hit by a severe debt crisis. Th e downside is the reputational ef fect: given the history of debt default, the heightened sovereign risk may cause  international capital markets either to close against future borrowing for some  period, or to add a risk premium to the rates charged.22 Th e advantage to the  economy in crisis and seeking debt relief is that it frees up resources from ser vicing the foreign debt for reallocation toward stimulatory government expen 
diture that will boost domestic demand, hastening the recovery. Th e second important policy response to the crisis observed in Argentina  but not in Australia is that the former eff ectively devalued its currency. In fact  it introduced a dual currency system, a gold and paper peso, holding the value  of the former but allowing the inconvertible paper peso to depreciate relative to  the gold peso. Th e devaluation was substantial— more than 50 percent between  the late 1880s and the mid- 1890s. Again, there is nothing surprising about this re sponse to an external crisis in a small, open, developing country operating under  a fi xed exchange- rate regime, of which the gold standard is the archetype. Th e  prices of imported goods rise when measured in domestic currency, so expendi ture switches to domestically produced substitutes, stimulating local production.  
22 Historical studies of the extent to which defaulters are subsequently penalized do not show a  uniformly negative outcome; other factors seem also to matter. But, ex ante, the future attitude of  the international capital markets to a defaulter seeking fresh raisings is unknown. 
Depression, Drought, Federation • 131 
And the incomes of Argentine exporters increased because their products were  more competitive in foreign markets, and they received higher prices (mea sured in paper pesos), with both eff ects increasing domestic demand and em ployment. Argentine economic historians attribute the fi ddling of the exchange  rate, together with the debt relief, as major factors accounting for the brevity of  the Argentine crisis and the rapid turnaround in its economic fortunes in the  1890s. I think that, had an IMF existed at the time, its advice would have been  to do pretty much as the Argentine government did, so close were its policies  to modern orthodoxy. 
Why did Australia not follow suit, as Australians were not unaware of events  in Argentina and could see the similarities in the antecedent conditions to the  crises in both? First, there was no national government in Australia— until  1901. Indeed, during the debt rescheduling, the national government in Ar 
gentina had to assume responsibility for the reckless borrowing of some of its  provincial governments. In Australia the colonies were on their own in their  dealings with the London capital market. Even had federation occurred prior  to the crisis, one may venture to suggest that the national government would  not have followed the Argentine example in responding to the crisis. Th is stems  from an assumption underpinning the responses of Australian political leaders  to the situation they found themselves in by the early 1890s that, whatever the  cost, it was unthinkable to default on, or seek a rescheduling of, foreign debts.  Perhaps this was culturally determined: a matter of trust or reputation with  “kith and kin” in Britain— both the imperial government and the London  banks. Th e belief that future dealings with the London capital market would be  seriously impaired for a prolonged period appears to have been implicit in the  near- complete absence of discussion of seeking a rescheduling of the debt as  an option. Similarly, the prospect of currency devaluation in some guise, with  the aim of raising the incomes of Australian exporters and also stimulating  activity in the import- competing sectors, was never seriously canvased. Indeed  there was more discussion of the possible advantages of moving to a bi- metallic  standard— no doubt of advantage to domestic silver producers. So, partly for  institutional reasons, and partly for reasons of imperial affi nity, the fairly ob vious policy recommendations that would now be high on any list, and were  adopted in Argentina, were not implemented by any of the Australian colonies. 
Of course a comparison with Argentina has its limitations: there are many  other diff erences between it and Australia that might also account for their  very diff erent postcrisis economic growth performances. Relevant to longer- run  infl uences on growth is the issue of the extensive margin of rural settlement  or “frontier” and its role in boom and bust, as previously considered. Austra 
lian land settlement and initial rural occupation occurred ahead of that on  the pampas or the Canadian prairies and, with some regional exceptions, es pecially in Western Australia, had been completed by 1890. In the other two 
132 • Chapter 6 
settler economies, the period 1895 to 1914 was a boom time, and in each case a  boom closely associated with the geographical expansion of agriculture, espe cially wheat production.23 
Tropics, Crops, and Melanesians: Another Road Not Taken 
Australia is unusual among advanced economies in that a signifi cant part of the  continent lies in the tropics. In some current debates among economists, latitude  matters: the tropics seem not to have been as conducive to economic growth as  more temperate- zone regions.24 And the settlement of tropical Australia has in 
deed lagged that of the rest of the country: the population there remains small,  and there are no large urban areas. One early attempt to expand the regional  economy illustrates some of the obstacles to development in the tropics, but  also draws our attention once again to the critical role of institutions in the  course of economic growth in Australia. Accordingly it is important to review  the circumstances surrounding the importation of Melanesian indentured  labor into Queensland, an arrangement devised primarily to assist in the culti vation of sugar there. 
Th e combination of sugar production and imported (coerced) labor is a cen tral element in the pattern of development that arose out of the initial endow ments characteristic of regions in the Caribbean: labor- intensive crop produc tion subject to scale economies at the level of the fi rm but a shortage of local  
labor leading, in turn, to the importation of slave or indentured workers for the  plantations. Th e resulting unequal distribution of wealth and political power  persisted, and the path of development led in the long run to relatively low  incomes despite reporting some of the highest incomes in the Western Hemi 
sphere in the eighteenth century.25 Was north Queensland in danger of adopt ing similar growth- retarding economic institutions? 
Early economic development in coastal north Queensland has some simi larities with that of the Caribbean sugar economies. Th e newly established  Queensland government had received permission from the secretary of state  for the colonies to import “coolie” labor from India, and in 1861 passed an act  for its regulation. However attempts to secure Indian or Chinese labor for the  pastoral industry failed in the face of British and Indian objections. Th e Pacifi c  islands were an alternative source. In 1863 sixty Melanesians were brought to  the Brisbane area to work on a private venture to grow cotton, which was expe riencing high prices as a result of the American Civil War. But it was primar

ily the sugar industry that took off in the 1860s. Initially production was on  “plantations” that grew, milled, and refi ned their own sugar, using Melanesian  labor. Between 1863 and 1904 more than 62,000 indenture contracts were writ ten, though because of the practice of re- indenture, this overstates the number  of Melanesians brought to Queensland. Th e average annual number recruited  was 1,699 in the 1870s; 2,536 in the 1880s; and 1,307 between 1893 and 1900.26 
Th e labor came on “contracts” for fi xed periods, so appears to have been  voluntary. However there is uncertainty over the degree of coercion used in  recruitment in the islands, and over the extent of the Melanesians’ understand ing of the terms and conditions they were agreeing to. It was certainly inden tured labor, regulated by the colonial government, but at the time, and since, it  has oft en been regarded as semicoercive. From the beginning there was wide spread opposition to the system in the rest of Queensland, in the other Aus tralian colonies, and in London. Partly this was on moral grounds, as with the  earlier antitransportation— and the British antislavery— movements.27 Partly it  was on economic grounds, the fear that cheaper labor would lower agricultural  and pastoral wages. And partly it was on social cohesion— or outright racist—  grounds. So who was in favor? 
Th e sugar industry was locating in coastal areas in tropical Queensland, and  the pastoral industry was also extending inland in the north of the colony. Th ey  both sought cheap labor. It is unclear how much the demand for imported  labor refl ected cost pressures— that white labor could only have been obtained  at wages and conditions that would have rendered sugar or pastoral produc 
tion unprofi table. Th e other factor discussed at the time was climate. Th e plant ers appeared to believe they needed non- European labor; and one governor  of Queensland was “dubious of the possibility of cultivating sugar- cane in the  tropics with white labour,” but the colony’s premier disagreed— “Th e same  thing used to be said about Moreton Bay [Brisbane].”28 
Th e extent to which the colonial government supported the planters var ied. When opposition in the colony to the Melanesian labor arrangements  mounted, the response in the north was to threaten separation— the formation  of a new colony that, presumably, would be unfettered in devising its own labor  recruitment policies and labor- market institutions. Th is intensifi ed following  an election fought on the issue of imported Indian and Melanesian labor, and  the passage of legislation in the Queensland Parliament in 1884 to limit the  employment of the Melanesians to unskilled occupations in tropical and semi tropical agriculture, and to make it illegal to import Melanesians aft er 1890

(a decision that was reversed in 1892). Th e pressure for separation reached a  turning point in 1887. Th e British government alone had the power to change  boundaries, but decided it would consider the request it had received from  the northern separatists only aft er a majority vote in favor of separation in the  Queensland Parliament— which, of course, would not be attainable.29 
Part of the story of the gradual demise of the use of Melanesian labor in sugar  production was the rise of the “central mill” system for crushing the cane and  refi ning the sugar.30 It was found that by shift ing these two stages of produc tion from the plantation to a local sugar mill and refi nery, scale economies  were realized, lowering costs, and making smaller cane growers competitive in  the cane- growing stage. Hence by the mid- 1880s, sugar plantations were being  subdivided, and the colonial government provided fi nancial support for the  construction of the central mills on condition they buy cane from farms em ploying only white labor. However, white labor was generally confi ned to the  mills, with the small cane- growers each employing a few Melanesians— who  were not permitted to own land. 
Following the federation of the six colonies into the Commonwealth of Aus tralia in 1901, one of the fi rst pieces of legislation in the federal Parliament  was the Pacifi c Island Labourers Act, ending indentured labor in (the now  state of) Queensland through the deportation of the Melanesians beginning  in 1906, with compensation paid to the employers— bounties and subsidies/ protection for the sugar industry. In some small part, the Commonwealth was  brought into existence to remedy a perceived failure in the existing institutional  arrangements.31 
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the story of indentured Melanesian  labor in Australia is thus not why it emerged— the preconditions seem to have  been similar to those found elsewhere in terms of climate, crop, and factor  endowment— but how it ended. Contrary to the impression of institutional  lock- in and persistence central to the perspective that initial endowments de 
termine fundamental institutional arrangements, and hence long- run growth,  the practice of using indentured labor was abolished. Th is was partly as a  
29 Shann (1988 [1933], p. 311) suggests that the reasons the British might have taken this posi tion include a fear that a precedent might otherwise be set for secession elsewhere in the empire  (including home rule for Ireland); and a fear in the City that Queensland bonds might be less  secure from repudiation aft er the loss of the north, as had happened in the United States during  the formation of new states. 
30 Th ese organizational changes in the industry are described in Shlomowitz (1982), pp. 339– 44. 31 Th ere was a fear in the other colonies that the Melanesians brought to Queensland might  subsequently move, unrestricted, elsewhere on the continent. Since federation would lead to  the transfer of immigration powers to the federal government, this fear would be assuaged. It is  important to note that the discussion of the Melanesian problem in the debates leading to federa tion were oft en linked to the wider debate on immigration policy, and that the act relating to the  Melanesians in the federal Parliament was followed by the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901—  the origin of the notorious “White Australia” policy.

consequence of the changes in production methods that made alternatives to  plantation- based sugar- growing more effi cient (although colonial government  regulations and subsidies encouraged these market forces), partly through pop ular opposition from within Queensland expressed within the framework of  existing political institutions, and partly through a newly created institution—  the Australian Parliament. Th e interaction of economic and political institu tions here seems central to this outcome.32 
Might it have ended diff erently? Th e critical point seems to have occurred  in 1887 when the north Queensland separatists failed in their bid to gain sup port from the British government for the creation of a new colony. Had the  British agreed— they only had to follow the same procedure that had led to  the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859— would a soci ety and economy have emerged that looked similar to those in the antebellum  South of the United States or in the Caribbean? Writing in 1933, a leading eco nomic historian considered that “[p]olitical separation for north and central  Queensland, had it come in the [eighteen] ’eighties, would have set up a type  of colony which Australia had escaped, an aristocracy of white planters seeking  the wealth needed for their ascendancy by the obsolete and stagnant method of  semi- servile labour.”33 Blainey has also ventured an explicit counterfactual: “In  North Queensland in the 1880s arose the kind of separation movement which,  had it existed thirty years earlier, would have had quick success”; and “Th e re fusal of the British government to create a separate colony in the late 1880s was  probably a turning point in our history. At the time it seemed a decision of no  great importance but it probably prevented the emergence of a seventh colony  which could have become a stronghold of coloured labour.”34 Th e poor long run growth outcomes recorded by similar economies suggest that the failure of  the north Queensland separation movement was indeed an important episode  in the history of Australia’s economic prosperity. 
Economic Effects of Federation 
Th e federation of the six colonies into the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901  ranks with the granting of responsible self- government in the 1850s as a major  turning point in the constitutional and political history of the continent. Since  growth economists increasingly identify the set of constitutional and politi 
cal arrangements and institutions as one of the “fundamental” determinants of  why some countries are rich and others poor, this inquiry must include a brief  
32 Th is is consistent with the analysis of institutional persistence and change in Acemoglu and  Robinson (2006b).

assessment of the impact of federation on the prosperity of Australians.35 Iden tifying this impact is relatively straightforward in the short run— say up to the  First World War, the period that is the main focus of this chapter. Th ereaft er  disentangling the infl uence of constitutional and political arrangements from  
all other infl uences on growth and prosperity proves increasingly diffi cult. Initially the new federal government comprised little more than the postal  service— the Postmaster General’s Department. It would take some years to or ganize a separate federal bureaucracy for such purposes as the collection of  customs revenue or the compilation of statistics. Indeed, the new Common wealth Bureau of Census and Statistics (CBCS), forerunner to the Australian  Bureau of Statistics (ABS), issued its fi rst annual Year Book only in 1908. In ad dition, there was no central or reserve bank to assist the monetary and fi nancial  management of the new nation. Th e Commonwealth Bank, established in 1911,  was primarily designed to off er depositors a publicly owned alternative to the  private institutions that had proved so prone to collapse in the 1890s, and from  1913 it assumed the role of banker to the federal government. It acquired note issuing powers in 1924, but it was to be much later before wider central- bank  functions were added, and not until 1960 that a stand- alone Reserve Bank of  Australia was created. 
Any short- run impact of federation on the course of economic aff airs, and  on national prosperity, would thus arise only through the economic policy de cisions of the new federal government. Some are well known. An early act of  the federal Parliament related to the accession by the Commonwealth of pow ers over immigration. As just indicated, the context was the issue of Melanesian  contract labor in Queensland. But the wider issue of the racial or ethnic com position of Australia’s immigrants was also in play: this was the origin of the  so- called white Australia policy, though restrictions and exclusions had earlier  applied within the colonies. Th e short- run economic implications of this pol icy, beyond its eff ects on the sugar industry in Queensland, were small. How ever the story was diff erent in the longer run. An immigration policy that de  facto excluded classes of immigrants who would possibly have been prepared  to work for lower wages and less favorable conditions than those currently en joyed by many workers would be a key element in the eff ort to maintain a high  wage economy in Australia. 
Under the Constitution the power to set a common external tariff was given  to the federal government, while all intercolonial tariff s (indeed, all barriers to  interstate trade) would be abolished. Th e level of the new national tariff , imple mented in 1902, was a compromise arrived at in the context of the colonies  having had diff erent levels of protection: New South Wales had been the least  protectionist, Victoria the most. Nonetheless, there seems little doubt that the

average level of protection increased for the country as a whole since bargain ing between the states resulted in the uniform national tariff rates being set  mainly in reference to those prevailing in Victoria. In theory this would have a  negative eff ect on national economic welfare. A related question is whether the  subsequent adjustments to the tariff down to the First World War, notably the  Lyne tariff of 1908, had any signifi cant economic impact. 
Any immediate eff ects of the transition to the new tariff structure are dif fi cult to discern because of the concurrent economic dislocation and downturn  resulting from the severe drought. Th us accounts of particular fi rms or indus tries facing trading diffi culties in the fi rst years aft er federation may refl ect the  impact of the new tariff regime, or may be due to the unrelated deterioration  in market conditions. Because the economy was operating at less than full em ployment due to the drought, the lift in protection may even have had a posi tive net eff ect on employment and thus domestic economic activity in the very  short run. Th ereaft er the average level of tariff protection changed little in the  prewar period. Th us it is unsurprising that there is no clear evidence suggesting  a signifi cant eff ect, either positive or negative, of the federal tariff on growth or  prosperity before 1914.36 
In the labor market, important institutional innovations were made in the  area of industrial- disputes resolution, and key decisions regarding minimum  wages were announced within this new regulatory regime. Th ese decisions  fl owed directly from the constitutional provisions regarding federal powers over  aspects of labor relations, and gave disputes settlement and wage determination  a quasi- judicial and increasingly centralized character that, broadly speaking,  was to persist until the reforms of the 1990s. Th e Commonwealth Conciliation  and Arbitration Court was established in 1904 with the power to determine  wages and conditions in cases where industrial disputes crossed state boundar ies, and to impose compulsory mediation. Most intensively examined in the  history of wage determination in Australia has been the Harvester judgment  of 1907, which established a “living wage” for a worker (and his family) that  became the benchmark for subsequent determinations of the “basic” wage. Yet  despite these innovative institutional and policy changes, there is scant evi 
dence they had any discernible eff ect on the operation of the wider economy  prior to the war.37 
Closely related to these federation- era institutional and policy changes may  have been changes in social norms (including of fairness) or expectations (in cluding of government in providing welfare and economic “security” or sta bilization). Perhaps it is through these mechanisms that the experience of the

1890s depression bequeathed its greatest imprint on society, though it is dif fi cult to directly identify any causal links. It is clear, though, that the strikes and  unemployment associated with the depression greatly infl uenced the agenda  and world view of the labor movement in its search for improved working con ditions and economic security, a search pursued through enhanced political  representation and the creation of new labor- market institutions, especially at  the federal level. Th e key question here, however, is whether New South Wales,  Victoria, or any other colony would have experienced a signifi cantly diff erent  growth path between 1901 and 1914 had federation not occurred. Constitu tional, political, and related legal arrangements would all have been diff erent  in such a counterfactual. But within this time frame, neither the level nor the  
distribution of incomes is likely to have been greatly aff ected. When we look instead to the consequences of federation for growth and  prosperity aft er 1914, the conclusion is likely to be very diff erent. During the  twentieth century the size and scope of federal government involvement in the  economy greatly expanded, its policies with respect to the tariff and regulation  of the labor market evolved markedly, and the ascendance of macroeconomic  policy priorities gave it increased infl uence relative to that of the states. On  closer inspection, however, it is evident we must look beyond the constitutional  and political arrangements surrounding federation if we are to account for  these later changes in the role and impact of the federal government. Other  developments, not foreseen by the founding fathers, interacted with the foun dational arrangements they constructed. Th at is, the federal Constitution began  to infl uence economic performance only in the context of subsequent events.  Most signifi cant among these were a succession of major negative shocks,  beginning with the First World War. Th is war, the diffi cult international eco nomic environment of the 1920s, the depression of the 1930s, and the Second  World War, were the immediate causes of the most important changes in na tional economic institutions and policies during the fi rst half of the twentieth  century. Th e federal structure was the constitutional framework within which  these challenges were responded to, new institutions were created and policies  amended. But there was nothing inherent in federation itself— or that was  an inevitable consequence of it— that determined the form or timing of these  key institutional and policy outcomes over following decades. Th us it is not  easy to distinguish the eff ects of “federation” per se from subsequent and prob ably more powerful institutional and policy infl uences on growth and prosper ity. Th is is a theme to which I will return in later chapters. 
Of course, there exists something of a natural experiment on whether the  individual colonies would have been better off economically if they had not  federated— ever. Seven colonies participated in the discussions leading up to  federation but one stayed aloof. So the New Zealand economic experience since  1901 may help in thinking about the counterfactual of a no- federation world.  Specifi cally, to what extent, and within which periods, was growth and prosper-

ity in New Zealand some indication of what might have been the experience of  at least some of the Australian colonies? Until 1960 there is no evidence of per  capita GDP in New Zealand falling markedly behind that of Australia, although  this does not rule out that it may have been even higher as the seventh state.  Nor does it establish that one or more Australian states may have diverged (up  or down) from their historical growth experience had they, too, declined to join.38 Aft er 1970, New Zealand’s economic performance fell behind Australia’s, despite  increased economic integration across the Tasman Sea (fi gure 2.1). Many infl u 
ences bear on the recent comparative performance of the two national econo mies, just as there are well- known sources of the changing patterns of growth  among the Australian states.39 Identifying the contribution of federation per se to  the observed outcomes may be diffi cult, but this is the challenge if it is to be as signed a key role as an institution underpinning long- run prosperity. 
Accounting for the Loss of the “Top Spot” in Income Per Capita 
Between 1890 and 1914 Australia lost its position as having the world’s high est incomes. Why? Th e depression of the 1890s and slow recovery from it are  clearly contributing factors in the short run, since neither the United States nor  Britain experienced comparable economic conditions, especially aft er 1895.  But there must have been other and deeper factors in play, or despite some  delay in bouncing back from the depression, the previous sources of relative  prosperity should in the longer term have reemerged and returned Australia  to its former ranking. One way to identify these is to return to the framework  previously adopted to account for how Australia had secured the top spot. It  turns out that the specifi c advantages identifi ed as underpinning the relative  prosperity of Australians before 1890 did not persist much beyond then. And  the reasons for this are not directly due to the depression or the slowness of the  recovery from it.40 
By 1914 Australia’s per capita income was only 3 percent above that in the  United States: given the quality of the historical data we can say that there was  
38 Western Australia has occasionally exhibited secessionist tendencies— though mainly rhe torical in nature. In 1901 its population was only 184,000, less than 5 percent of the Australian  total. Its impressive growth and prosperity date from its postwar mineral discoveries: prior to  this it may have struggled as an independent entity— in comparison, say, to the much larger New  Zealand economy. 
39 In this context, the relative contribution of natural- resource- based activity in Australasia’s  regional economies may be an important source of the diff erences in their long- run performance.  I will have more to say in chapter 9 concerning the possible sources of the diff erent performances  of the two national economies during recent decades. 
40 Th e following discussion draws on Broadberry and Irwin (2007), Irwin (2007), and McLean  (2007).

rough parity in incomes in the two countries. Th e Australian advantage of 40  percent or more prior to 1890 had been all but eliminated. Since we are look ing at the ratio between incomes in the two countries, and how it changed over  time, we have to be alert to the possibility that American demographic, labor  force, or productivity trends changed in a favorable direction by more than oc curred in Australia. And this seems to have happened with respect to workforce  participation rates: by 1914 they were similar in the two economies. Because  the participation rate (or employment to population ratio) is the outcome of  many diverse infl uences operating by region or by gender— to give just two  examples— it is not yet clear precisely why this occurred. With respect to the  gender ratio, the unusually high masculinity rate observed in the Australian  data prior to 1890 gradually fades. With its origins in immigration accompany ing the gold rushes, if not earlier, this is a clear case of one favorable infl uence  on Australian incomes that was independent of the 1890s depression experi ence and that gradually weakened over several decades. 
But there is more to the decline in Australia’s relative position than can be at tributed to demography and workforce participation. Th is can be illustrated by  assuming that the relative advantage in labor productivity Australia enjoyed in  1891 was preserved until 1911, then re- estimating the ratio of incomes relative  to the United States in that year. Australian incomes would have been 20 per cent above American incomes, but the gap would still have fallen by about half  from what it had been in 1891. Th at is, the loss of a clear superiority over U.S.  incomes aft er 1890 must substantially be due to a decline in Australia’s relative  productivity performance. And the explanations for this are more speculative. 
One possible drag on Australia’s productivity performance would have arisen  had there occurred a signifi cant re- allocation of labor from higher to lower  productivity sectors in the economy. A theme of much discussion in the twenti eth century was that just this was happening with respect to the declining share  of agricultural employment and rise in that of manufacturing, a point made  especially in relation to the potentially adverse consequences of encouraging  industrial development behind high levels of tariff protection. Whereas farm 
ing was export oriented, hence had to be internationally competitive, the same  could not be said of manufacturing. Whatever the magnitude of this drag on  national effi ciency in later decades (a topic we revisit in the next two chapters),  it was unlikely to have played a major role before 1914. For one thing, the sig 
nifi cant lift in tariff protection for manufacturing came in the interwar period,  not prior to 1914. Also, there was no substantial reallocation of the labor force  at this time: between 1891 and 1911, the share of manufacturing employment  rose only by between 3 and 4 percentage points.41 
Th e other resource- based industry, mining, which like agriculture was char acterized by high levels of productivity and export competitiveness, experi

enced a major boom in the 1890s in the shape of the Western Australian gold  discoveries. Th is would in principle help sustain overall productivity during a  period of depression and drought adversely eff ecting output in the rest of the  economy. But by 1914 the peak of the gold boom had already passed. Unlike the  gold rushes of the 1850s— following which gold production declined gradually  over several decades, and gold retained its position as the most important ex 
port for two decades— the decline in production from the Western Australian  goldfi elds was more rapid. Australia- wide gold production peaked at 3.8 mil lion fi ne ounces in 1903, but fell to 2.1 million by 1914, though this was above  what it had been in the late 1880s. Th e share of GDP from the production of all  minerals was almost the same in 1911 as in 1891.42 Hence the mining industry  is unlikely to have played a signifi cant role in the decline of Australian com parative productivity performance at this time. 
As labor productivity and incomes rise during the course of economic devel opment, one result may be a change in workers’ demand for leisure. Th at is, an  increase in labor productivity may support an increased wage, reduced hours  of work (increased leisure) at the same total wage, or a mix of the two. Th ere  is evidence that both American and Australian workers in the late nineteenth  century and early twentieth were increasing their average hours of leisure.  However the Australian workers were showing a much stronger preference for  substituting leisure for labor. From a welfare perspective, there is no diff erence  in the two situations insofar as they were freely chosen, and hence simply refl ect  diff ering preferences, as mentioned in chapter 2. But output would be lower in  the society that chose more leisure. Could this have contributed to Australia’s  decline in measured incomes relative to the United States? With the data pres 
ently available, we can only guess that it may have. One study has estimated that  if average incomes are augmented by the higher leisure in Australia, then the  “augmented- income” per capita there in 1913 would be 13 percent above that  in the United States rather than 4 percent by conventional estimation.43 Th e  methodology is diff erent from the productivity analysis such that a direct com 
parison is not possible; but this exercise suggests that the diff ering labor- leisure  choices made in the United States and Australia might be a contributing factor  to the closing of the income gap between them. 
Our analysis of Australian prosperity in relative terms is helpful in highlight ing what might otherwise go unremarked, but such an analysis requires care.  One should hesitate before attributing a fall in relative performance wholly to  the Australian economy when closer inspection may reveal that it is the per formance of the benchmark economy that needs explanation— as we have  seen with respect to workforce participation rates. Similarly, in the case of the  
42 Gold production is from Kalix, Fraser, and Rawson (1966), p. 177; the share of mining in  GDP from Butlin (1962), pp. 10– 11.

slowdown in the rate of increase of GDP per capita aft er 1890, we should ask  whether the U.S. performance is, rather, the more unusual and requires ex planation. Referring back to the comparisons across a number of economies  previously made indicates that this is not the case. Canada, Argentina, and New  Zealand also did much better than Australia in growth performance from 1890  to1914. Th us, the emphasis on the seeming underperformance of Australia  during this time appears warranted. 
Anticipating later discussion, from 1914 to 1939 there was continued very  low growth in per capita GDP in Australia, such that the half century from 1890  to 1940 is considered a period of near stagnation according to some measures  of prosperity. But Australia was not alone in this inability to resume more rapid  growth aft er 1914, suggesting common forces were in play throughout the  world economy up to the Second World War. Only in the period between 1890  and 1914 is Australia out of step, underperforming compared to its peers, and  recording a much lower rate of growth in incomes than had been experienced  over previous decades. In the Australian story the end of the long nineteenth century boom occurs in 1890, whereas for the international economy, and for  other rich economies in both the Old and New Worlds, the boom continues  another quarter of a century until the outbreak of the First World War. 
• • • 
I have argued in this chapter that the crisis of the early 1890s was neither the  fundamental cause of the stagnation in incomes in the quarter century fol lowing 1890, nor a suffi cient explanation for the loss of Australia’s position as  having the highest incomes. Th e depression was clearly a searing experience,  infl uencing individual expectations and social beliefs alike. But its impact on so  many levels was profound only because of the four decades of prosperity preced ing it and the failure to resume similar growth rates aft er the recovery from it.  If, as has been suggested, the boom was in part inherently transitory or unsus tainable, then the boom, slump, and subsequent poor economic performance  have to be viewed jointly, as must their wider social and political consequences.  Would the individual and collective responses to the experience of the 1890s have  been diff erent had there been a clear appreciation at the time of the basis of the  country’s prosperity between the gold rushes and the 1880s? Perhaps such an  appreciation would have led to the adoption of diff erent policies in the colo nies during the boom years, policies that would have lessened the severity of  the slump itself, and hence mitigated the painful adjustments that followed.  Indeed, one might speculate that federation might have appeared less attrac tive (as illustrated by the case of New Zealand), the labor movement given less  momentum at the industrial or political level, and hence the ideological and  institutional legacies of the 1890s been less signifi cant.

Finally, one must consider whether the depression and slow recovery in the  1890s might be interpreted as, at least in part, some variant of a resource curse.  In the very long run Australia has clearly avoided an Argentine fate of drop ping out of the rich club of countries. And as seen in chapter 2, it has generally  managed to hold a position within that club alongside the best performers in  terms of living standards, despite never having regained equal ranking with the  United States. But over shorter time periods, such as the quarter century dis cussed here, might the abundance of natural resources in farmland and miner als discovered and exploited before 1890, in myriad ways and oft en indirectly,  have contributed to a set of expectations and behavior that contributed to the  severity of the required adjustment aft er 1890? Clearly the answer to this ques tion is yes. But I have also stressed that in several respects the boom and de pression look similar to many others, then and since, in small open economies.  So it is not necessary to be resource rich in order to experience a foreign debt  crisis or currency crisis or terms of trade collapse suffi ciently serious to usher  in a period of lower growth and reduced prosperity. And as emphasized in this  chapter, the principal institutional weakness in the “Australian” economy ex posed by the crises— the lack of a national government— was addressed with  some alacrity in the movement toward federation.
