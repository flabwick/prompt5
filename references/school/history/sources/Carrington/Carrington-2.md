or as a novelty for a while, played no unusually great part in the lives of those involved in the rushes, while in older, quieter mining settlements religious duties were performed as automatically as elsewhere. Certainly the gold-rushes provided a good opportunity for evangelism, but the digger was essentially a man of no moderation, and neither the successful nor the failures are men the most receptive to argument. 
G-old-rushes normally involved alluvial fields. As these became worked out more and more attention was given to the exploitation of reef and matrix gold, often buried deep in the earth. Here the individual digger, or the small group, was powerless, since even when the shaft had been sunk and gold-bearing rock brought to the surface, the gold itself could only be obtained by crushing and processing - an expensive operation in many cases, where the gold yield was often as low as one ounce per ton of quartz or less. It could only be made profitable by company mining, with considerable capital resources. The floating of companies provided ideal chances for swindlers and stock-jobbers to reap their profits from the unwary. The Sydney newspapers warned their readers against plunging too heavily into the many companies being formed in England with the avowed intent of working Australian gold-fields. Many of them were of

dubious value, as could be seen from t i t l e s such as the 
’Lake B a t h u r s t G-old Mining Company’ . Many were u n d o u b te d ly 53

Rather than attem pting to remove the obvious signs of hard manual lab o u r which t h e i r c lo th in g and general appearance proclaimed, the diggers tended, in a self-co n scio u s way, to a s s e r t i t .

This d e s c rip tio n , w ritte n in July 1851, holds good of the mass o f New South Wales d i g g e r s :

Conformism in d re s s, then, would appear to be a digger cha r a c t e r i s t i c . Rough language and hard drinking suggest a  conscious or unconscious conformism of behaviour to a cer t a i n degree.

Chapter 3 
ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT 
During the weeks after Hargraves’ triumphant announce ment in May excitement in Sydney soared as the desire spread to share in the riches to be won in the west, and it soon 
appeared that all who were able were filled with a deter 1 
mination to join in the stampede from the capital. As they hurried off, ill-equipped and ignorant of the nature of their task, often losing all sense of reason and propor tion in their desire to gather a quick fortune, it appeared to those who fancied themselves wiser that the fruits of sixty years of labour in building in New South Wales an 
ordered British community were to be cast away in the current 2 
infatuation with gold. In a community which had been accustomed, from the very nature of its settlement, to pro tection and direction from a paternal government in all major developments, eyes were now turned towards that body in the hope that it would bring order out of the present

chaos. For the government this was no easy task. The emergency came at a time when the old Legislative Council had been dissolved, and before a new council, under the provision of the 1850 Australian Colonies Government Act, had been elected. All weight of responsibility therefore 
lay upon the Executive, which, since no other British colony had been the scene of extensive gold discoveries, was des titute of any guiding precedent to help decide its course. And all the time the example of social and economic con fusion in California, resulting from a lack of adequate central organization, stood before FitzRoy and Deas Thomson as a warning against the dangers of delay. Sir William Denison, then Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, wrote of the dangers in a warning letter to Earl Grey 
Here we are protected from the evil to a certain extent by the presence of convicts, a class who cannot leave the colony; but should a sudden change in the policy of the government put a stop to 
transportation, we shall feel it most deeply In the ruin of most of the landed proprietors, who form now the basis of a sound and healthy population. 
New South WaLes, too, is as much interested as we are in the maintenance of the system, for unless she can procure the necessaries of life from us, the population must be reduced to great distress from actual want of food.4

The following day was published a list of Provisional Regu 10

orders to proceed immediately to the diggings to implement 11 
the regulations, and five days later, on 28 May, Charles 12 
H. Green was sent to help him as Assistant Commissioner. As confirmation was received of the extension of the known auriferous area into the Turon valley in July, and to Abercrombie and Araluen further south during the following months, it was found necessary to appoint another seven 
Assistant Commissioners to officiate at the various digging 13

later, though the southern colony was soon to take the  lead in adapting the system to deal more adequately with  changes in the nature of the industry. Basically the  system adopted by New South Wales in those early days of  gold-mining was sound, but its satisfactory operation in 
evitably depended upon the selection of honest and competent  commissioners, upon the equitable, just, and realistic  nature of the regulations under which they must work, and  upon the readiness of the diggers to co-operate. The ab sence of one or more of these factors was a prime cause of  all trouble or discontent at the diggings, unsuitable regu lations being the most common reason for dissatisfaction. 
In considering its actions the government had first to  decide upon the spheres and limits wherein lay its own  obligations and duties, and a clear indication of what it  considered these to be appeared in the first list of Pro visional Regulations. Existing interests which were of  great importance to the colony must be preserved and pro tected as far as possible. This meant, above all else, the  vital wool-growing industry, but withdrawal of labour to  the gold-fields threatened the well-being of city employer  as well as pastoralist. The regulations included a clause

requiring the production of a clearance certificate from the applicant’s former employer, or equally satisfactory evi 
dence that he was not 'a person improperly absent from hired 17 
service’ before a licence to dig could be issued. This precaution was reinforced by the determination of certain 
magistrates to inflict the severest penalties under the 18 
Masters and Servants Acts upon errant labourers. Much opposition to these measures was expressed both on the dig 
gings and in the columns of the self-appointed diggers’ 19 
champion, the Empire, and their impracticability was re cognized after a few months when the commissioners, satis 
fied to issue licences to all who sought them, ceased to 20 
question eligibility. The prohibition against deserters 
was still continued in the first regulations issued under 21 
the 1852 G-old Fields Act, but remained almost a dead letter in practice. Henceforth employers, including the government itself, had to meet the competition of the gold fields by offering higher wages. Salaries of all government

ment o f d e s e r t e r s , however, c o n ti n u e d i n f u l l f o r c e . To  safeguard landowners from u n restric te d invasion of th e ir  property by hordes of gold-seekers, the regulations included  a provision th a t in the case of private lands held in fee  simple, licen ces to dig for gold were to be issued only to  the p ro p rieto r or to persons duly authorized by him. 
Those sections of the P rovisional Regulations which  in s titu te d the payment of a d ig g e r's licence fee were p er haps the most unpopular so far as the diggers themselves  were c o n c e rn e d . The a d m i n i s t r a t i o n and p o l i c i n g o f th e  g o ld -fie ld s e n ta ile d increased government expenditure, and  i t determined to o ffse t th is by raisin g revenue from the

sum which a t f i r s t was s e t a t 5 0 / - p e r month, t o be c o l l e c t e d 23 
in advance by th e com m issioner. Pew could h o n e s t l y deny  the ju stic e of making the diggers pay the costs of th e ir  own p r o t e c t i o n in c ir c u m s t a n c e s where such p r o t e c t i o n would  not otherwise have been av ailab le, but the object of impos ing a lic e n c e fee was not confined t o the mere c o l l e c t i o n of  such a re v e n u e . By making t h e issu e o f a l i c e n c e c o n d i t i o n a l  upon the production of a c e r t i f i c a t e of good c h a ra c te r i t  was hoped t h a t th e c r i m in a l element a t the d ig g in g s would  be kept a t a minimum, and th a t lab o u rers with other o b lig a ­

the sum of 30/- per month out of their earnings were thereby 
proved to be inefficient, and would be far better employed 25 
at their accustomed occupations. Such arguments were little heeded in the first excited rush to the diggings. After the initial flush of enthusiasm it is very likely that the high cost of licence fees combined, with the wear ing out of the glamorous veneer which at first attached to the idea of digging for gold,to discourage many. Diggers who through ill fortune or inefficiency had failed to pro fit relinquished their ideas of a hastily acquired fortune to return, sadder if not wiser, to their homes. 
Tales of ingenious methods of evading payment of the 26 
licence fee were common, and at the Havilah field Assist 
ant Commissioner Green countered the diggers’ blunt refusal 27 
to pay by closing the diggings. When the industry settled down, however, evasion does not appear to have been the rule amongst bona fide diggers, since any claim which proved to 
be at all productive was likely to be ’jumped' if its owner 28 
were found to be working without a licence. Despite its

to be served at the commissioner’s tent. Technically, •until the beginning of 1853 no person was exempt from pay ment of the fee if he lived and worked in the vicinity of a gold-field, but under the Gold Fields Act of 1852, women, children under 14 years of age, prospectors, and persons 
33 
engaged in pastoral or agricultural pursuits were excused, 
and by an amendment in September 1853 clergymen, civil serv 
ants, schoolmasters, sick persons, and servants were added 34 
to the list of exemptions. A constant source of grievance during the six years in which they were collected, licence fees continued to be imposed by the New South Wales govern ment until more than two years after the Eureka riot at 
Ballarat had demonstrated to the Victorian government the 35 
diggers’ views on the matter. In abolishing the licences in March 1857 the older colony was merely following the example of her southern neighbour, where a gold export duty had in 1855 replaced the revenue from licence fees, and where

it had been realized so much earlier that a good deal of 
the income from licences was consumed by the cost of col 36 
lection. 
In the absence of a Legislative Council all provision for the management of the gold-fields had had to be made by proclamation. Thus the revenue from this quarter became the property of the Crown, since it had not been voted by the Council. When challenged, however, the government did not argue this in support of keeping control of gold revenue, but sheltered behind the excuse that since they were derived from Crown Lands, all proceeds from royalties on matrix gold, escort charges, and the sale of licences belonged to 
the Crown in the same manner as other revenue from Crown 37 
Lands. Since the latter had been reserved from colonial control by express command from the Imperial government, it alleged that FitzRoy’s government had no discretion in the matter, and that control of the gold revenue could not be surrendered to the Legislative Council. Wentworth in Sep 
tember made a magnificent speech in the Council, refuting 38 
the government’s claims, but the issue was settled two days

increased expenditure out of the Crown Revenue. The elected members had made their point, and in December 1852 
the council formally accepted responsibility for gold-fields 41 
affairs by passing the first Gold Fields Management Act. The primary task confronting the government in its formulation of a gold-fields policy had been one of organiz ing a system of management. The example of chaos in Cali fornia was too close and too vivid for those concerned with the welfare of New South Wales not to feel a certain degree of alarm lest similar occurrences should take place within the colony. The government's action in deploying available police in the vicinity of the diggings at the earliest opportunity showed its determination that the situation should not be allowed to get out of hand, and there was no lack of support for this policy from conservative elements. Digging communities, whose outstanding characteristic during rush conditions was their instability, had, it was argued, 
to be strictly controlled as well for their own benefit as 42 
for the well-being of the colony as a whole. In its determination to preserve good order, the government went

further than the mere provision of police for the protection 
of life and property. Unlicensed sale of spirituous liquors 43 
was prohibited on or in the neighbourhood of the gold-fields. Drunkenness had long been a major blot on colonial society, and it was soundly reasoned that its banishment from the diggings would make the task of management easier. Prohi bition was easier than abolition, however, and there were many who were prepared to supply illegally the alcohol which could not be obtained legitimately. Soon every field had 
its full quota of sly-grog establishments, many of them re tailing a mixture which was far more harmful to its con sumers than plain brandy or rum. Restriction’s only con tribution to society was the establishment of meeting places for the lawless at the sly-grog shops, and the 
consequent creation of much additional work for commissioners 44 
and police. 
In response to popular demand the government in July 1851 extended its responsibilities by undertaking the task of conveying gold from the western diggings to Sydney, and on 2 July advertised for the supply of horses and drivers

for a proposed escort conveyance. No satisfactory tenders 
were received, and the first consignments were sent later 46 
that month in the mail coach, escorted by police. The 
first southern escort from Braidwood began operations on 47 
24 November, in a vehicle provided by Andrew Badgery. In 48 
July 1852 an escort was provided for the northern mail, and in the same month the Legislative Council debated a 
plan to establish a service between the Yictorian gold 49 
fields and Sydney, but the suggestion was not acted upon 
until later the Sydney Gold Escort Company was formed pri 50 
vately for this purpose. The first gold escort in the 
north began operations between the northern diggings and 51 
Tamworth at about the same time. In the early years the 
gold was usually carried by a contractor, with a police 52 
guard. The first charge, in 1851, for the conveyance of

gold to Sydney was 1 per cent, and in 1852 provision was made for the carriage of banknotes under the same conditions. By 1856, when gold was being worked in widely scattered regions, further escorts were operating from Mackerawa in the west, and Armidale and Rocky River in the north, and the charge was reduced in September of that year to 8d per ounce for the conveyance of gold, no change being made in the rate for banknotes. On 24 July 1857 it was declared that all gold which was sent down to the Mint for coinage, 
and the proceeds of such gold were to be transmitted free of charge by the escort. Charges for notes and specie, not being the proceeds of gold sent to the Mint for coinage, were reduced in 1858 and 1859 to one-fourth per cent. With such low charges the escort service could not possibly show a profit, and in 1864 the Colonial Treasurer at last de 
clared that the situation was most unsatisfactory, with the 53 
escort operating at a considerable loss. On 30 August of that year the Executive Council accepted and endorsed his proposal ’that a charge of 8d per ounce should be made for the conveyance of gold between intermediate stations, in whatever direction, and for whatever distance it may be

Closely bound up with the story of the gold escorts is that of the Sydney Branch Mint. As early as December 1851 the possibility and desirability of establishing such an 
institution, together with an Assay Office, was being dis 60 
cussed in the columns of the Empire, but the Sydney Mint 61 
was not opened until 14 May 1855. It had been requested by the inhabitants of New South Wales for the benefit of their own colony, and was maintained at the expense of that colony alone, with no subsidy from either the Royal 
Mint in London, or any of the other colonies of the Austral - 62 
ian group. Its benefits were not confined to this colony, 
however, for the coin it produced was current in all the 63 
colonies of the group. To it came gold for coining from

gold-bearing rock, and for experiments in various methods 69

of these regions, the west, Captain Battye was appointed 73 
Superintendent of Patrol in May 1851, in command of 38 men; 
the following year a force of ten was operating in the 74

the southern patrol of 31 men. These patrols remained fairly constant at this strength until the rise of bush ranging on a large scale in the south and west caused the authorities to double the police In those two areas in 
1860, and to add to the southern patrol a detachment of 18 76 
foot police. The north was less troubled by lawlessness, and In consequence its patrol, led after April 1859 by 
Superintendent Lawrence H. Scott, was not greatly increased 77 
in strength. In April 1862 the new Police Act sponsored 72

intendent of Police had held the highest office in that 79 
service. The former superintendents of the various re gional patrols included Scott, Zouch, Chatfield (who had been appointed to the command of the western patrol after 
Battye was dismissed in April 1861 for alleged monetary ir 80 
regularities), and J.A. McLerie, son of the Inspector General, who had been Assistant-Superintendent of the south ern patrol under Zouch. In all, eight superintendents were appointed, four of whom continued in office, together with J.W.
