SYNOPSIS 
A fter following with excitement fo r three years the  news of th e gold-rushes in C a lifo rn ia , the c o lo n is ts of  New South Wales found s i m i l a r e x c i t i n g o p p o r t u n i t i e s  su d d e n ly r e v e a l e d i n t h e i r own t e r r i t o r y i n May 1 8 5 1 , when  Edward Hammond H a r g r a v e s made p u b l i c t h e news o f h i s d i s ­ c o v e r ie s n e a r B a t h u r s t .

As a r e s u l t of t h e g r e a t e r p u b l i c i n t e r e s t i n t h e  V ictorian f ie ld s , both in A ustralia and overseas, the  great m ajority of immigrants a ttra c te d by gold went to  t h a t c o lo n y , and New South Wales was s p a r e d th e swamping  of the pre-gold population by immigrants which V icto ria  experienced. Moreover, being the seat of an o ld er, more  f i r m l y e s t a b l i s h e d s o c i e t y t h a n th e d a u g h t e r c o lo n y , New  South Wales was not changed and dominated by th e d ig g e rs  t o th e same d e g re e as V i c t o r i a .

The most o u ts t a n d i n g i n c i d e n t d u r in g t h i s p e rio d was  the s e r i e s of r i o t s at Lambing F la t in 1860-1, when the  diggers combined to drive the Chinese from the f ie ld , and  forced the government to r e s t r i c t Chinese immigration into  the colony. The p r e v a i l i n g element in th ese p roceedings  was n o t one of r e a s o n e d d i s a p p r o v a l o r o f a c t u a l p ro v o c a ­ tio n by the C hinese, but b lin d and p a ssio n a te p re ju d ic e ,  which spread rap id ly from the g o ld -fie ld s to infect the  whole colony u n t i l r e s t r i c t i o n betokened the removal of  the ’menace’ . 
Though th e i n t e r i o r was as a r e s u l t of th e d ig g in g s  t h r u s t i n to th e l i g h t of p u b lic n o t i c e , few of the many  gold se ttlem e n ts survived the gold-rushes to become  t h r i v i n g p r o v i n c i a l c e n t r e s , u n l e s s t h e r e was an economic  need for such a community to serve as a re a l centre fo r  an a g r i c u l t u r a l or p a s t o r a l r e g io n . Such c e n tre s were  served by the communications network which the g o ld -field s  inspired, but the most important requirem ents, such as  roads and railw ays, did not m a te ria liz e as a r e s u lt of
vi 
gold-field pressures. Unlike the Victorians, the New South Wales miners could not muster enough political in fluence to win such amenities. Gold-digging here was of secondary importance. 
There was a strong individualistic strain in many of the diggers, but this very factor made it difficult for the development of militant political groupings of miners, who, until the spread of wage-labour in the 1870s 
took effect, had no inclination to combine for any but the most immediate needs. Political apathy rather than radicalism was the hall-mark of the New South Wales diggers. Their conduct on the fields was generally marked by a greater calmness and peace than was the case In Victoria, though this disappeared in the continuous rush in the western district during the 1860s.

INTRODUCTION 
Since 1851 much labour has been expended upon explana tions of Australia’s debt to her gold-rushes, and the extent to which they influenced the formation of the so-called Australian national character. Poets and bush bards have embraced the subject eagerly, producing soul-stirring works at varying levels of literary merit. These in turn have provoked reactions, though not in verse, the most noteworthy of which is Russel Ward's Australian Legend. But whether or not the heroic form of the legendary ’digger type’ is claimed as the spiritual forefather of the first A.I.F., and whether he was a product of the manly, gold-field way of life, or of the pre-gold ’bush civilization’, there is one factor common to almost all writings and thoughts on gold in Australia; the picture is dominated by Victoria at first, and later adapted to Western Australia. It is drawn in Victoria, and superimposed upon New South Wales. Ballarat and Bendigo, magic names both, appear as typical gold-rush communities. 
This is no recent phenomenon. Even in the early years of the rushes, when the interest of nations - especially those of the United Kingdom - was focussed upon Australia, 
1

’Australia’ to them meant Victoria, or Melbourne and its  satellite gold-fields. It was in Victoria that the great  discoveries of rich auriferous land were made. Ballarat  and Bendigo became famous because their gold deposits were  of unusual value and extent. They were certainly not typic al gold towns, for they remained centres of population even  after the gold had gone, whereas the majority of such settle ments left little but legend for posterity to remember them  by. There was nothing in New South Wales to equal the wealth  of these two. As a producer of gold she could not hope to  rival Victoria, which played by far the greater part in  Australia’s gold story, and events and attitudes there in evitably had the greater effect upon the opinions of ob servers remote in distance or time. Nevertheless, New South  Wales by no means followed the Victorian pattern in every  way. She was by comparison an old-established colony, with  
a history of over sixty years of settlement and consolida 1 
tion. Victoria in mid-1851 was very young and almost empty.  Their respective stories might fairly be distinguished by  a comment that in the 1850s a gold-rush occurred in New  South Wales, while at the same time Victoria was little  else than a self-governing gold-rush. 
1
The official census return gives the population of Victoria  in 1851, before the gold-rushes, as 87,545. 
3 
Most contemporary publications referring to the gold fields are concerned with Victoria alone, and many others mention New South Wales but briefly. More recent general histories, such as E.O.G. Shaun* s Economic History of Australia and 3. Fitzpatrick’s 3ritish Empire in Australia, provide much useful background information, though the sections on gold are again concerned primarily with Victoria. Most local histories, normally compiled to commemorate a jubilee or centenary, are devoid of useful information on this period, though there is no lack of romantic nostalgia for the digging days. Excepted from this condemnation are 
2 
W.A. Bayley’s books on Grenfell, Nundle, Young and Albury, 
though his custom of omitting source references is irritat ing. Donald Friend’s Hillendiana contains much interesting information on the Hill End-lambaroora field, and Ransome 
Wyatt’s History of Goulburn is also useful on this period. An excellent model for useful local histories is provided by the Cooma-Monaro Historical Society’s Historic Kiandra. published in 1959 to mark the centenary of the Kiandra gold-rush. It has no profession to historical comment, but presents a series of extracts from contemporary books and

newspapers. This 'scissors and paste* method of presenting  information does not detract from the enjoyment of the  general reader seeking knowledge of a localized sequence of  events, and is of more value to the working historian than  Bayley’s story-hook type of presentation. 
Very little research work has been done concerning the  history of goldmining in New South Wales. The Regional  Research Monographs, numbers 1 and 5, published in 1950 by  the New England University College, on goldmining around  Armidale and Glen Innes, are very useful, but remain iso lated examples of what needs to be done. The only other  work is in unpublished thesis form, and is very limited in  quantity and scope. Only two are known which deal with New  South Wales, both theses for the degree of M.A. They are  D.F. Mackay's 'Rocky River Gold Field, 1851-67’, and  N.O.P. Pyke's 'Foreign immigration to the gold fields,  N.S.W. and Victoria, 1851-61’. Both proved to be very use ful, especially in providing bibliographical information. 
Documentary material is abundant in the Mitchell  Library, Sydney, but proved to be of no great value. Other  sources were examined at the National Library, Canberra,  the Alexander Turnbull Library and Victoria University Lib rary, Wellington, New Zealand, and the Auckland Public  library.

Victoria's wealth was revealed. The principles of admin istrative methods and practice formulated in the older co lony became the basis for the organization of the Victorian  industry in the important early years. The contribution  of New South Wales was a framework for gold production by  which the chaos which had overtaken California might be  avoided. 
The greatest single influence upon the pattern of  Australian gold-rushes nevertheless came from California. The lengths to which the lure of gold will draw ambitious  men had already been demonstrated more than twenty years  before, in the state of Georgia. Here the Cherokee tribe  of Indians had signed a treaty with the United States go vernment guaranteeing them permanent possession of their  lands. They quickly adopted European customs and way of  life, and established villages, well-run farms, churches,  and commercial enterprises, similar to those of the Americans  around them. But gold was discovered on their land. In  response to urgent prompting by its citizens, the state  government declared that a treaty between an indigenous  tribe and the federal government was not binding upon the  state of Georgia, which had not been consulted. By force  and stratagem the Cherokees were finally removed from their
8 
ancestral lands and deported to the waste lands west of the 
3 
Mississippi, and gold-hungry diggers took their place. 
Another twenty years passed before the modern world's  first major gold-rush took place. As a result of the ex perience and powers of observation of an old Georgian miner,  gold was found and recognized at Sutter's Mill in California 
in 1848. Georgians there demonstrated the art of panning, 4 
and California entered upon her golden age. By the time  Edward Hammond Hargraves discovered gold in New South Wales  in February 1851, the industry was already well developed  in California, where he had learned his trade. Into an al 
most empty, slackly-governed territory, newly captured from  Mexico, poured thousands of adventurers in search of excite ment and wealth. California began to experience action on  a scale and at a rate which few parts of the world had seen  before. With a weak local government, far from the seat of 
power, the immigrants made full use of the opportunities 5 
for free enterprise. Unhampered by restrictions or by law,

What would have happened i n New South Wales had t h e  C alifornian rushes never taken place? Presumably the gold  d e p o s i t s would have b e e n found a t some t i m e . S a t i s f a c t o r y  methods of working them would have been evolved by a process  of t r i a l and e rr o r even had th e re been no 'o ld C a lif o r n ia n s '  t o t e a c h t h e c r a f t and I n tr o d u c e the t o o l s . What fo rm ,  however, would the system of working gold deposits have  taken? This question is p a rtly answered by Gipps' plea to  th e Rev. W.3.

would have worked the gold-fields by wage labour, under a  system similar both to the road-making practice then current  in the colony. In short, the government might have decided  to work the mines as a state monopoly. 
After 1848, this was no longer possible. The impact  of events in California was felt no less in Sydney than in  other parts of the English-speaking world. The exodus from  Sydney caused considerable concern in that city’s press,  with fears of depopulation loudly expressed. At the same  time, the presence of her citizens in California aroused  an almost personal interest in events there. Stirring  things were happening in California. Owing to the lack of  an effective law enforcement body, a crime wave of great  magnitude had appeared both in the mining camps and in the  cities of San Francisco and Sacramento, and was gathering  force in the first months of 1851. Conditions were ideal  for its expansion, with questionable characters from all  nations mingling freely with honest fortune-hunters in a  very fluid society. The group singled out as scapegoats by  the Californian press was that from the penal colonies of  Australia, all immigrants from whence were declared at least  to be tainted by their contacts in Sydney and Hobart even  if they were not actually as dishonest as most of their com patriots. The Vigilance Committees of San Francisco and
11 
Sacramento, which were created to counter lawlessness by implementing the laws of fear and force, seized upon the  Australian menace, and endeavoured to remove it permanent ly. A declaration was issued forbidding immigrants from  Sydney to land unless they had a personal character refer ence from the U.S. consul there. Two of the four men hanged  by the San Francisco committee in 1851 were from Australia.  Y/ild stories about an intended convict takeover of the state  were freely circulated to increase popular agitation, and  
the blame for the many fires which devastated the crowded 8 
wooden cities was laid squarely upon Australian incendiaries. Naturally this anti-Australian hysteria produced its  reaction in Sydney. California was constantly described  as chaos on earth, whose example was to be avoided at all  costs. Californians were depicted as bearded, be-pistoled  savages, whose answer to a fancied insult was invariably a  challenge to a duel. Material gain might be won from gold

rushes, but moral ruin was an inevitable consequence if 9 
California was to be taken as an example. Nevertheless, California was the sample followed, and was the main factor in deciding the course of the Australian rushes. With this example before the people, and news of California being republished in Sydney journals after the arrival of every boat from San Francisco, no government restraint was possible. Australia was to experience full-scale gold-rushes, rather than officially-founded mining settlements. 
But if California was the principal model, it was not copied slavishly in New South Wales. The colony could not under any circumstances be compared with California, for it had a long tradition of ordered government from a strong centre. A paternal government had led it along the path of development, taking a direct interest in all major under takings. Free enterprise was not given its head as in Cali fornia, where little restraint was possible. Sydney con trolled New South Wales as Sacramento was never able to control California during its early rushes. FitzRoy’s gov ernment from the beginning took a detailed interest in gold mining affairs, and its example of official control over all developments was copied by Victoria. In many ways the latter

13 
colony resembled California - it was largely a mining com munity, strong enough to exercise its will, seldom wise  enough to know fully what its will was. New South Wales’  legislation and administration were not always suitable  for Victorian conditions, and a new system had to be evolved  
in Melbourne, though the idea of governmental control re mained. The difference between the two colonies came to be  that with responsible government the miners were in a  position to dictate to the Victorian authorities, but not  to those of New South Wales. 
Hargraves’ announcement in 1851 followed closely the  granting of self-government to New South Wales, and the  separation of Victoria. For five more years government  action was not necessarily bound by a majority decision in  the Legislature. After 1856, however, a government respon sible for its actions to an electorate including large  numbers of diggers had to weigh their opinions against its  actions. In 1858 direct representation was granted to the  miners - the only example of interest-representation outside  the Sydney University seat - and henceforth they elected  three members to the Legislative Assembly. Nevertheless,  governments were seldom dictated to by the miners, whose  influence, potentially so strong, was actually weak through  a lack of political organization. What Victorian miners
14 
were able to express by sheer weight of numbers, those of New South Wales could have achieved only through organiza tion, and this they failed to do. 
Since the colonial government was by tradition expected to take the lead in all important matters, and since it had shown its willingness to assume the role of protector of gold-fields affairs, it was considered to be the govern ment's task to tackle all connected problems to the satis faction of the diggers and those interested in their success. Roads and mail services must be provided and maintained by the government, though country road transport remained the preserve of private enterprise. Railways were expected, though this was not yet to be the railway age in New South Wales. Regulations were formed for the actual control of the diggings, and officers appointed to supervise their operation. Increased immigration, long recognized as a prime need for the colony, brought with it social problems of assimilation, especially in the case of Chinese, which only the government could solve. All these problems were thrust upon a newly self-governing community in addition to the normal problems of recent national maturity, such as taxation and tariff policy, and development of the co lony's other resources.
15 
The pessimism with which pastoralists had received news of the gold discoveries is understandable. The 1840s had not been a happy period for them. Discontinuation of transportation was considered a misfortune which would rob them of controllable labour. While free labour was prefer able, it was not always procurable, and assigned labour had for so long been a stand-by that the abolition of the system was considered an irreparable harm to the pastoral industry. 
Economic slumps during this decade had not helped instil 10 
optimism into the graziers. These, however, were troubles of the 1840s, and by 1851 a recovery was well under way. The prospect of a possible mass desertion of labourers to the gold-fields filled their employers with such dismay that most seemed blinded to the advantages which might accrue to their industry from the increased demand for meat, which the gold-rushes created, and the increased shipping space available for wool and hides in returning emigrant vessels. Their pleas for government intervention to check or control the expected tragedy were inspired by fears that were genuine enough, but, as it proved, mostly needless. Gold, though it was to produce many upsets for the colony, did not bring about its ruin.

Chapter 2 
THE DIGGINGS AND THE DIGGERS 
’An Australian type of mining camp was evolved in the years 1851 to 1858, and it is surprising how each field conformed to this type. The many accounts of the various fields written by observers in the 
’fifties are curiously similar. They tell of the long lines of washers and rockers beside the stream; the field honeycombed with claims In all stages of excavation; the eager feverish toil of men not now working for a master but for themselves; the Com missioner's tent beneath its flag; and the constant altercation of police and diggers over the production of licences. Nightfall was heralded by the "cease work” gun fired from the Commissioner's tent and the twinkle of a thousand fires reddening against the dusk; the lethargy of meal time was followed by the gradually rising chorus of relaxation - here a group sentimentally singing its songs of homeland; there the noisy discord of a gambling dispute; and always the drunken brawling and shouting of those upon whom the sly grog-sellers lived. Finally, as night drew on, there was the contant popping of firearms emptied each night for careful reloading by anxious diggers, and the slow surrender of the pin-points of firelight to the enveloping darkness.'1 
Thus, in truly poetic prose, G.Y. Portus painted his picture of an Australian mining community. Despite his obvious tendency towards romanticism, and the differences imposed upon such settlements by size and location, season

and stage of development, this paragraph contains within it much that was true of most gold-fields. Commissioners, police, and sly-grog sellers form the supporting cast on each, and diggers followed much the same pattern of every day behaviour everywhere. The picture, however, cannot be claimed to give anything more than a vague and general im pression of gold-field society. It describes only the early stages of a rush, without theatre, public-house, or restaurant, and with the Commissioner still quartered under canvas. Cold-fields, like time itself, did not stand still, but went on from phase to phase, changing perhaps according to a general pattern, but each retaining a certain individ ual ity. 
California had figured prominently in the thoughts of the colonists of recent years. They had seen how gold could transform an empty country into a bustling state whose vigour and drive impressed the world even more than the excesses accompanying such a mushroom growth. Through their newspapers and travellers’ tales Australians had a romanticized but clear idea of what was expected of them in the event of gold being discovered in their own country. When Hargraves made his announcement in May his seed was planted in ground that had been well dug and thoroughly prepared, though the rapidity with which the golden beanstalk
18 
grew amazed all and dismayed many who believed their own crops to be in danger of withering under its shadow. The colonists generally did not share this pessimism. Seeing this exotic growth within their own reach - a fairy-tale from a far-off land suddenly re-enacted in all its wonder within their own country - they scrambled to explore and see for themselves, like children on holiday. Every man saw himself in the role of Midas, and gold was ever on his lips until he became disenchanted by cruel experience. 
The road westward to the diggings from Sydney was filled with excited gold-seekers as all who could, includ 
ing ’influential gentlemen’ and ’leading merchants’, made 2 
for the diggings. A Sydney baker announced sadly that ’One of my men has bolted to the digging’s (sic), and being 
short of tools has taken with him the Bakehouse shovels and 3 
flour sieve’. The air of vibrant excitement is well con veyed in a report in the Bathurst Free Press of 24 May. 
At the present time there are about 1,000 people at the mines, and the number is daily increasing. And when it is considered that Ophir is the centre of an immense circle from which many new trodden roads radiate in all directions, and that a steady stream of human beings is daily flowing from each, some idea may be formed of the rapid increase of digging

or themselves constitutionally unfitted, for such enter 7 
prises....’ Disillusioned by the hard work, physical discomfort, and lack of immediate success, those unsuited to life on infant gold-fields returned to their homes. Others stayed, many prospered, and gold digging began to develop from being the subject of an exciting excursion for a few days from Sydney, into a major colonial industry, manned by skilled workers. Some months were to pass, how ever, before the elements of uniformity which this develop ment brought were really established. As yet the gold fields, by now including the Turon as well as Hargraves’ Ophir, were worked in a peaceable manner, ’thereby giving the lie to the wholesale libels which the Californian press 
has heaped upon Australians’, claimed the Bathurst Free 8 
Press proudly. This early crime-free stage did not last long. By 12 July the Empire noted in a leader that, now 
the first excitement had died down, crime was re-appearing 9 
in the ’natural’ manner. The gold-fields were fast becom ing a normal section of colonial life.

If the first phase of the gold-rush period is defined as that during which the colonists of New South Wales flocked to the diggings, sampled the experience of working there, and quickly decided either to remain or to return to their homes, the second is undoubtedly that which began with the influx of adventurers from neighbouring colonies. This was not long delayed. An Empire leader of 23 June describes the arrival in Sydney within 24 hours alone of 
seven vessels from South Australia and Victoria, carrying 10 
238 passengers. Presumably most of those drawn to New South Wales by the lure of gold intended to dig for it them selves, and lost no time in making for the diggings. When news arrived a few months later of the riches of Ballarat, many Victorians returned south, motivated, as the Empire's 
Sofala correspondent uncharitably put it, by the ’natural 11 
desire to crow on one's own dunghill....' 
Immigration was expected to be greatly stimulated by 12 
the gold discoveries, and the colony waited impatiently for the benefits of this to appear. As late as May 1852 - one year after the first rush to Ophir - the Herald was

M e n ’s head were turned with the whirl, and away they plunged, madly diving for gold - a well-behaved, sheep-breeding, sheep-eating, sleek and sober colony, all wool and tallow, comfort and prosperity, became the noisiest country in the world; - talked of, written of, legislated for, envied, abused, praised, coveted, and above all, hurried to - by energy as its own place - by laziness as the shortest road to live without doing anything - by avarice as its heaven - by generosity as the best hope of lifting up the grey head of a ruined father - by money as its market - by poverty as its relief - by theft as the land of plunder - by honesty as a way to pay debts - by vice as an open sphere - by piety as the scene for a mission; - all this rushing in red-hot, and bringing to one point every passion and every project that youth or age, ambition, energy, whim or genius could foment, the whole stirred by the burning hope of gold - gold - gold, has poured itself out - is pouring itself out, on those once peaceful plains, and there is a heaving and sweltering, as when a water-spout is discharged upon the sea.17 
New South Wales was to some extent protected from such a great inundation as Victoria suffered by this very channel ling of the tides of immigration into the southern colony, but the Rev. Mr Arthur’s breathless description sums up diggers’ motivations north of the Murray as well as those in the south. Ambition, restlessness, and desperation drove men of all types and all classes to a common task. As Russel Ward says, newcomers to the diggings sought to hide their inexperience by adopting the dress and mannerisms of the older bushman class which had become standardized before

1851. But there would appear to be little difference between the personal habits and rough clothing of diggers anywhere, whether in California or Australia. They were, it may be inferred, dictated more by expediency than by 
preference, though the presence of a desire to conform can not be denied. 
Diggers in New South Wales were generally of a migra tory tendency. Where there were settled fields with a large community of permanent diggers it was a matter for 
comment, though such fields did exist, a notable example 19 
being the Braidwood area. New discoveries rapidly drew off the population of other nearby fields. Diggers were ever willing to join a rush to a new field on the strength of the slightest rumour. This tendency seemed to increase rather than the reverse as the years passed by, and the diggers became more of a permanent class than a cross-section of colonial society. Professional diggers, with no fixed home or other occupation, might well be expected to be more vulnerable to rumours of better fields further on. The Port Curtis rush, near Rockhampton, was a perfect example of diggers' rootlessness. Rumours circulated of rich and

extensive deposits of gold there at Canoona, and thousands joined the rush, from Melbourne as well as from Sydney, with no thought for anything else. The G-overnor of New South Wales, Sir William Denison, was disgusted. 
I think these rushes speak most unfavourably for the state of the people who are engaged in them. They appear to be bound by no ties; they leave home, wife, children, carried off by a most in tensely selfish spirit; they do not think of any duty which they owe to their country, or to their family, to say nothing of that which they owe to God; but every impulse of their selfish nature is obeyed on the instant.... 20 
The Canoona muddle was not helped by the unduly opti mistic reports of Captain M.C. O ’Connell, the government official in charge of administration of the field. His reports, and those of his colleagues, give glowing accounts of the progress and prospects of the diggings from 26 August well into September, and not until 27 September did he show any sign of worry that the field might not be as promising as first it seemed. One week later he tells of a majority of diggers wishing to return south. 
It is evident that a complete panic has taken 
possession of the minds of all those who have 
hurriedly quitted other occupations in Sydney to hasten hither, tempted by the accounts of the 
quantities' of gold obtained by the first diggers at Canoona; and this feeling of alarm at finding

themselves so far from their homes, without the facility of picking up gold immediately on their arrival, has proceeded to such an extent that the stream of immigration has almost entirely ceased....' ^ 
He goes on to request government aid in further exploring the area around in order to make new ground available for the destitute to work upon. Instead, the Victorian govern ment sent a steamer to bring back those who wished to re turn. In New South Wales the emergency was met by a public fund to assist diggers to be returned to Sydney and resettled in employment upon the gold-fields and elsewhere in the co 
lony, to which diggers as well as others subscribed lib 22 erally. 
O ’Connell’s report as quoted above appears to indicate that many of those involved in the Port Curtis rush were not regular diggers, but inhabitants of Sydney. Regular diggers did not learn the lesson so painfully illustrated, however. Port Curtis was but the forerunner of a long series of similar rushes, each more or less depopulating the previous one. Kiandra was the centre of attraction in 1859-60, Lambing Plat 1860-1, Forbes in 1861, then G-renfell,

were only three dance girls, and those who were  fortunate enough to secure one as partner must have  found it hard work dancing on a floor fully an inch  thick in mud. Just fancy fifty diggers coming into  a room with their muddy boots, and walking about;  what a nice state the floor would be in for dancing. It struck me as a queer sight to see hairy-faced  men in pea jackets, and long boots, with pipes in  their mouths, dancing together. The dance room was  a great attraction, after every dance the landlord  expected each girl to entice her partner to the  bar, to pay for a drink for himself, his partner,  and often-times a friend or two.27 
Horse racing was popular with the diggers at Kiandra as 
elsewhere, and Preshaw tells, with a touch of humour, how 28 
rowdy gangs organized the results to suit themselves. The rush moved on to Lambing Plat, and Preshaw followed it in July 1861. It proved to be still more lawless than Kiandra, though the notorious riots of that year had finished. ’When I first went to the Plat, I have often, when snug in bed, heard some poor fellow, who was being eased of his cash, calling out "Murder” , "Police". In coming home from the 
29

Only the movement of the rush yet again to Porbes improved  the social condition at Lambing Plat, indicating perhaps  that the parasite classes found easier and better pickings

in rush conditions than in settlem ents. C ertainly society  was in a f r e e r s t a t e in th e s e f r o n t i e r c o n d i t i o n s , and t h i s  would b e tt e r s u it the purposes of the law less. 
Although Kiandra, as a re s u lt of its severe climate  and d i f f i c u l t y of acc ess, is perhaps an extreme case even  fo r gold-rush cen tres, which were often beyond the bounds  of normal s e ttle m e n t, Preshaw’s d e s c r ip tio n of i t does  hold good f o r many o t h e r c e n t r e s . The r u s h came, a town sh ip sprang up, dance h a l l , s k i t t l e a l l e y , r a c e - t r a c k , and  b a rs a p p e a re d . Money flow ed as f r e e l y as a l o c h o l , violence  was common, u n t i l rumours o f a new s t r i k e e ls e w h e r e o c c u r r e d ,  and th e r u s h moved on. U n t i l i t had ceased t o be a gold  m etro p o lis, no amount of optimism on the p a rt of i t s in ­ habitants could ensure permanence for a digging township. When t h e r u s h had g o n e, t h e town s u r v i v e d o n ly i f i t was  n ecessary fo r the commerce and a g r ic u ltu r e o f the d i s t r i c t ,  l i k e Young. I f i t was n o t , i t w ith e re d and d ied l i k e Kiandra.  There was l i t t l e d i f f e r e n c e betw een th e New South Wales  rushes of the s i x t ie s and the rushes of C a lifo rn ia and Vic t o r i a in so f a r as d ig g in g s o c i e t y was co n cern ed . I t was  p red o m in an tly m asc u lin e . Community o f i n t e r e s t was shown  only when a s u f f i c i e n t l y b ig issu e a ro s e , such as Chinese  immigration. Otherwise the diggers tended to keep to th e ir  work in small groups, e a tin g , drinking, and making very
32 
merry when they could afford it. The police were not over efficient, but there was never any need to resort to Cali 
fornian lynch law, which had been necessary there to offset 30 
the lack of an efficient law-enforcement body. Isolated from the gold-fields by the great distances of New South Wales, Sydney never became, as Melbourne rapidly did, the focal point of the diggings. In New South Wales no such focal point ever existed, since the diggings were spread over the whole eastern part of the colony - a region some 900 miles long and 250 miles wide. Though this was roughly divided into three regions for administrative purposes, the real divisions were smaller, with a centre such as Braidwood or Armidale for the diggings in its vicinity, and very little sense of any greater community. Only the main rush of the sixties, beginning at Kiandra and rolling northwards from gold-field to gold-field, resembled the Victorian picture of a cohesive body of diggers. 
Life In the mining settlements, as distinct from the later standardized rushes, varied of course, from year to year and according to geographical location. A study of reports from and comments on such settlements, however,

While a settlement was flourishing , the diggers did not lack sources of entertainment. Travelling circuses and minstrel shows toured the various gold-fields to gather 
their share of the rapidly-circulating produce of the dig 37

projected theatre at Sofala had to be abandoned in November 39 
1851, its timber being sold to build an Anglican church.  Organized prize-fights were popular in the masculine atmos 
phere of the early diggings, and attempts by the forces of 40 
the law to stamp it out appear to have met with no success.  Turon diggers showed a blood-lust unusual even for the

around to see an organized fight between a sheep-dog and 41 
a bull-dog. 
For every mining township, however, the day eventually came when skittle-alley and billiard-room were silent, the bulk of the diggers having moved on, and those remaining behind being too sober-minded or too poor to turn their minds to lighter things. 
During the last three months the inhabitants of the Lachlan have been put to their wits’ end to find anything amusing. Previously there had been 
theatres in existence where the multitude could pass an evening and obtain a shilling’s worth of tragedy or comedy, and bad grog at sixpence a glass. Latterly, matters are assuming a more serious turn, and religious tea meetings and 
Christian associations are coming into vogue. Luring the prosperous days of the town the people were given to frivolity and excesses of various kinds; but, as adversity approaches, they seem to fly for refuge to something more substantial and serious.42 
But before such oppressive mid-Victorian morality overtook them in their declining years, the gold-fields were the scene of such excesses as to make it almost a natural re action to expect. Where there were diggers there was al cohol, and if it could not be obtained legally there were

Mining was n o t p e r m i t t e d on a Sunday, and t h i s came t o be the general re c re a tio n day on the diggings. Apart from

accommodate them. Prom time to time p u b lic opinion and 
the press were so outspoken in th e ir disapproval th a t the 48

or as a novelty for a while, played no unusually great part in the lives of those involved in the rushes, while in older, quieter mining settlements religious duties were performed as automatically as elsewhere. Certainly the gold-rushes provided a good opportunity for evangelism, but the digger was essentially a man of no moderation, and neither the successful nor the failures are men the most receptive to argument. 
G-old-rushes normally involved alluvial fields. As these became worked out more and more attention was given to the exploitation of reef and matrix gold, often buried deep in the earth. Here the individual digger, or the small group, was powerless, since even when the shaft had been sunk and gold-bearing rock brought to the surface, the gold itself could only be obtained by crushing and processing - an expensive operation in many cases, where the gold yield was often as low as one ounce per ton of quartz or less. It could only be made profitable by company mining, with considerable capital resources. The floating of companies provided ideal chances for swindlers and stock-jobbers to reap their profits from the unwary. The Sydney newspapers warned their readers against plunging too heavily into the many companies being formed in England with the avowed intent of working Australian gold-fields. Many of them were of
41 
dubious value, as could be seen from t i t l e s such as the 
’Lake B a t h u r s t G-old Mining Company’ . Many were u n d o u b te d ly 53

permanently employed in digging fo r gold, l i t t l e can be said if the intention is to c la ss ify or standardize a ll diggers. However, t h e r e a r e common c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s , and i n t r a c i n g these the r is k must be taken of over-g en eralizatio n . Rather than attem pting to remove the obvious signs of hard manual lab o u r which t h e i r c lo th in g and general appearance proclaimed, the diggers tended, in a self-co n scio u s way, to a s s e r t i t . T h e ir b l u f f succeeded in such a way t h a t t h e i r appearan ce caused l i t t l e comment a f t e r th e n e a r l y r u s h e s , save t h a t t h e i r r e d or b l u e s h i r t s and C a l i f o r n i a ’ o r c a b b a g e - t r e e hats were remarked from time to tim e. I t would seem th a t they attempted to id en tify themselves with the herd in th e ir d re ss, at le a s t in the e a rly years, a f te r which i t became a genuine c h a ra c te ristic ra th e r than an assumed mannerism. This d e s c rip tio n , w ritte n in July 1851, holds good of the mass o f New South Wales d i g g e r s : 
The c h a r a c t e r of th e people i s e s s e n t i a l l y nomadic,  but whether i f the p u rsu it of gold finding were  constantly follow ed, i t would improve, is exceed in g ly d o u b t f u l. The want of female s o c i e t y , the  gen eral n e g le c t of the person, and th e absence of  the numberless aids to c iv ilis a tio n which are  
c o n s t a n t l y in o p e r a t i o n in towns and v i l l a g e s , do  much tow ards roughening the whole man.

Conformism in d re s s, then, would appear to be a digger cha r a c t e r i s t i c . Rough language and hard drinking suggest a  conscious or unconscious conformism of behaviour to a cer t a i n degree. The digger mass which formed the most p a rt  of the continuous gold-rush of the s ix tie s can perhaps best  be lik e n e d to an army, where the same s u p e r f i c i a l conform ity  and th e same s e n s e o f o c c u p a ti o n a l community p r e v a i l . Like  an army too th e mass moved a c ro s s th e c o u n tr y s id e , w ith  s a t e l l i t e and p a ra s ite se ttlem e n ts sp rin g in g up where they  h a l t e d in t h e hope o f p r o f i t i n g from t h e i r p r e s e n c e .

Chapter 3 
ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT 
During the weeks after Hargraves’ triumphant announce ment in May excitement in Sydney soared as the desire spread to share in the riches to be won in the west, and it soon 
appeared that all who were able were filled with a deter 1 
mination to join in the stampede from the capital. As they hurried off, ill-equipped and ignorant of the nature of their task, often losing all sense of reason and propor tion in their desire to gather a quick fortune, it appeared to those who fancied themselves wiser that the fruits of sixty years of labour in building in New South Wales an 
ordered British community were to be cast away in the current 2 
infatuation with gold. In a community which had been accustomed, from the very nature of its settlement, to pro tection and direction from a paternal government in all major developments, eyes were now turned towards that body in the hope that it would bring order out of the present

chaos. For the government this was no easy task. The emergency came at a time when the old Legislative Council had been dissolved, and before a new council, under the provision of the 1850 Australian Colonies Government Act, had been elected. All weight of responsibility therefore 
lay upon the Executive, which, since no other British colony had been the scene of extensive gold discoveries, was des titute of any guiding precedent to help decide its course. And all the time the example of social and economic con fusion in California, resulting from a lack of adequate central organization, stood before FitzRoy and Deas Thomson as a warning against the dangers of delay. Sir William Denison, then Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, wrote of the dangers in a warning letter to Earl Grey 
Here we are protected from the evil to a certain extent by the presence of convicts, a class who cannot leave the colony; but should a sudden change in the policy of the government put a stop to 
transportation, we shall feel it most deeply In the ruin of most of the landed proprietors, who form now the basis of a sound and healthy population. 
New South WaLes, too, is as much interested as we are in the maintenance of the system, for unless she can procure the necessaries of life from us, the population must be reduced to great distress from actual want of food.4

The following day was published a list of Provisional Regu 10

orders to proceed immediately to the diggings to implement 11 
the regulations, and five days later, on 28 May, Charles 12 
H. Green was sent to help him as Assistant Commissioner. As confirmation was received of the extension of the known auriferous area into the Turon valley in July, and to Abercrombie and Araluen further south during the following months, it was found necessary to appoint another seven 
Assistant Commissioners to officiate at the various digging 13

later, though the southern colony was soon to take the  lead in adapting the system to deal more adequately with  changes in the nature of the industry. Basically the  system adopted by New South Wales in those early days of  gold-mining was sound, but its satisfactory operation in 
evitably depended upon the selection of honest and competent  commissioners, upon the equitable, just, and realistic  nature of the regulations under which they must work, and  upon the readiness of the diggers to co-operate. The ab sence of one or more of these factors was a prime cause of  all trouble or discontent at the diggings, unsuitable regu lations being the most common reason for dissatisfaction. 
In considering its actions the government had first to  decide upon the spheres and limits wherein lay its own  obligations and duties, and a clear indication of what it  considered these to be appeared in the first list of Pro visional Regulations. Existing interests which were of  great importance to the colony must be preserved and pro tected as far as possible. This meant, above all else, the  vital wool-growing industry, but withdrawal of labour to  the gold-fields threatened the well-being of city employer  as well as pastoralist. The regulations included a clause

requiring the production of a clearance certificate from the applicant’s former employer, or equally satisfactory evi 
dence that he was not 'a person improperly absent from hired 17 
service’ before a licence to dig could be issued. This precaution was reinforced by the determination of certain 
magistrates to inflict the severest penalties under the 18 
Masters and Servants Acts upon errant labourers. Much opposition to these measures was expressed both on the dig 
gings and in the columns of the self-appointed diggers’ 19 
champion, the Empire, and their impracticability was re cognized after a few months when the commissioners, satis 
fied to issue licences to all who sought them, ceased to 20 
question eligibility. The prohibition against deserters 
was still continued in the first regulations issued under 21 
the 1852 G-old Fields Act, but remained almost a dead letter in practice. Henceforth employers, including the government itself, had to meet the competition of the gold fields by offering higher wages. Salaries of all government

With a slig h t f a l l in the cost of liv in g  as a p re te x t, these increases in o f f ic ia l s a la rie s were  d isc o n tin u e d on 28 June, as soon as th e f i r s t wave o f  ex citem en t was o v e r.

ment o f d e s e r t e r s , however, c o n ti n u e d i n f u l l f o r c e . To  safeguard landowners from u n restric te d invasion of th e ir  property by hordes of gold-seekers, the regulations included  a provision th a t in the case of private lands held in fee  simple, licen ces to dig for gold were to be issued only to  the p ro p rieto r or to persons duly authorized by him. 
Those sections of the P rovisional Regulations which  in s titu te d the payment of a d ig g e r's licence fee were p er haps the most unpopular so far as the diggers themselves  were c o n c e rn e d . The a d m i n i s t r a t i o n and p o l i c i n g o f th e  g o ld -fie ld s e n ta ile d increased government expenditure, and  i t determined to o ffse t th is by raisin g revenue from the

sum which a t f i r s t was s e t a t 5 0 / - p e r month, t o be c o l l e c t e d 23 
in advance by th e com m issioner. Pew could h o n e s t l y deny  the ju stic e of making the diggers pay the costs of th e ir  own p r o t e c t i o n in c ir c u m s t a n c e s where such p r o t e c t i o n would  not otherwise have been av ailab le, but the object of impos ing a lic e n c e fee was not confined t o the mere c o l l e c t i o n of  such a re v e n u e . By making t h e issu e o f a l i c e n c e c o n d i t i o n a l  upon the production of a c e r t i f i c a t e of good c h a ra c te r i t  was hoped t h a t th e c r i m in a l element a t the d ig g in g s would  be kept a t a minimum, and th a t lab o u rers with other o b lig a ­

the sum of 30/- per month out of their earnings were thereby 
proved to be inefficient, and would be far better employed 25 
at their accustomed occupations. Such arguments were little heeded in the first excited rush to the diggings. After the initial flush of enthusiasm it is very likely that the high cost of licence fees combined, with the wear ing out of the glamorous veneer which at first attached to the idea of digging for gold,to discourage many. Diggers who through ill fortune or inefficiency had failed to pro fit relinquished their ideas of a hastily acquired fortune to return, sadder if not wiser, to their homes. 
Tales of ingenious methods of evading payment of the 26 
licence fee were common, and at the Havilah field Assist 
ant Commissioner Green countered the diggers’ blunt refusal 27 
to pay by closing the diggings. When the industry settled down, however, evasion does not appear to have been the rule amongst bona fide diggers, since any claim which proved to 
be at all productive was likely to be ’jumped' if its owner 28 
were found to be working without a licence. Despite its

oft-quoted unpopularity amongst the diggers, the licence  fee continued in existence u n til March 1857, having been  reduced from 30/- to 10/- per month in September 1853.

to be served at the commissioner’s tent. Technically, •until the beginning of 1853 no person was exempt from pay ment of the fee if he lived and worked in the vicinity of a gold-field, but under the Gold Fields Act of 1852, women, children under 14 years of age, prospectors, and persons

engaged in pastoral or agricultural pursuits were excused, 
and by an amendment in September 1853 clergymen, civil serv 
ants, schoolmasters, sick persons, and servants were added 34 
to the list of exemptions. A constant source of grievance during the six years in which they were collected, licence fees continued to be imposed by the New South Wales govern ment until more than two years after the Eureka riot at 
Ballarat had demonstrated to the Victorian government the 35 
diggers’ views on the matter. In abolishing the licences in March 1857 the older colony was merely following the example of her southern neighbour, where a gold export duty had in 1855 replaced the revenue from licence fees, and where

it had been realized so much earlier that a good deal of 
the income from licences was consumed by the cost of col 36 
lection. 
In the absence of a Legislative Council all provision for the management of the gold-fields had had to be made by proclamation. Thus the revenue from this quarter became the property of the Crown, since it had not been voted by the Council. When challenged, however, the government did not argue this in support of keeping control of gold revenue, but sheltered behind the excuse that since they were derived from Crown Lands, all proceeds from royalties on matrix gold, escort charges, and the sale of licences belonged to 
the Crown in the same manner as other revenue from Crown 37 
Lands. Since the latter had been reserved from colonial control by express command from the Imperial government, it alleged that FitzRoy’s government had no discretion in the matter, and that control of the gold revenue could not be surrendered to the Legislative Council. Wentworth in Sep 
tember made a magnificent speech in the Council, refuting 38 
the government’s claims, but the issue was settled two days

increased expenditure out of the Crown Revenue. The elected members had made their point, and in December 1852 
the council formally accepted responsibility for gold-fields 41 
affairs by passing the first Gold Fields Management Act. The primary task confronting the government in its formulation of a gold-fields policy had been one of organiz ing a system of management. The example of chaos in Cali fornia was too close and too vivid for those concerned with the welfare of New South Wales not to feel a certain degree of alarm lest similar occurrences should take place within the colony. The government's action in deploying available police in the vicinity of the diggings at the earliest opportunity showed its determination that the situation should not be allowed to get out of hand, and there was no lack of support for this policy from conservative elements. Digging communities, whose outstanding characteristic during rush conditions was their instability, had, it was argued, 
to be strictly controlled as well for their own benefit as 42 
for the well-being of the colony as a whole. In its determination to preserve good order, the government went

further than the mere provision of police for the protection 
of life and property. Unlicensed sale of spirituous liquors 43 
was prohibited on or in the neighbourhood of the gold-fields. Drunkenness had long been a major blot on colonial society, and it was soundly reasoned that its banishment from the diggings would make the task of management easier. Prohi bition was easier than abolition, however, and there were many who were prepared to supply illegally the alcohol which could not be obtained legitimately. Soon every field had 
its full quota of sly-grog establishments, many of them re tailing a mixture which was far more harmful to its con sumers than plain brandy or rum. Restriction’s only con tribution to society was the establishment of meeting places for the lawless at the sly-grog shops, and the 
consequent creation of much additional work for commissioners 44 
and police. 
In response to popular demand the government in July 1851 extended its responsibilities by undertaking the task of conveying gold from the western diggings to Sydney, and on 2 July advertised for the supply of horses and drivers

for a proposed escort conveyance. No satisfactory tenders 
were received, and the first consignments were sent later 46 
that month in the mail coach, escorted by police. The 
first southern escort from Braidwood began operations on 47 
24 November, in a vehicle provided by Andrew Badgery. In 48 
July 1852 an escort was provided for the northern mail, and in the same month the Legislative Council debated a 
plan to establish a service between the Yictorian gold 49 
fields and Sydney, but the suggestion was not acted upon 
until later the Sydney Gold Escort Company was formed pri 50 
vately for this purpose. The first gold escort in the 
north began operations between the northern diggings and 51 
Tamworth at about the same time. In the early years the 
gold was usually carried by a contractor, with a police 52 
guard. The first charge, in 1851, for the conveyance of

gold to Sydney was 1 per cent, and in 1852 provision was made for the carriage of banknotes under the same conditions. By 1856, when gold was being worked in widely scattered regions, further escorts were operating from Mackerawa in the west, and Armidale and Rocky River in the north, and the charge was reduced in September of that year to 8d per ounce for the conveyance of gold, no change being made in the rate for banknotes. On 24 July 1857 it was declared that all gold which was sent down to the Mint for coinage, 
and the proceeds of such gold were to be transmitted free of charge by the escort. Charges for notes and specie, not being the proceeds of gold sent to the Mint for coinage, were reduced in 1858 and 1859 to one-fourth per cent. With such low charges the escort service could not possibly show a profit, and in 1864 the Colonial Treasurer at last de 
clared that the situation was most unsatisfactory, with the 53 
escort operating at a considerable loss. On 30 August of that year the Executive Council accepted and endorsed his proposal ’that a charge of 8d per ounce should be made for the conveyance of gold between intermediate stations, in whatever direction, and for whatever distance it may be

Closely bound up with the story of the gold escorts is that of the Sydney Branch Mint. As early as December 1851 the possibility and desirability of establishing such an

Mint in London, or any of the other colonies of the Austral - 62

however, for the coin it produced was current in all the 63

gold-bearing rock, and for experiments in various methods 69

of these regions, the west, Captain Battye was appointed 73 
Superintendent of Patrol in May 1851, in command of 38 men; 
the following year a force of ten was operating in the 74 
northern district; and in March 1853 Assistant Gold Com 
missioner Henry Zouch resigned to become Superintendent of 75 
the southern patrol of 31 men. These patrols remained fairly constant at this strength until the rise of bush ranging on a large scale in the south and west caused the authorities to double the police In those two areas in 
1860, and to add to the southern patrol a detachment of 18 76 
foot police. The north was less troubled by lawlessness, and In consequence its patrol, led after April 1859 by 
Superintendent Lawrence H. Scott, was not greatly increased 77 
in strength. In April 1862 the new Police Act sponsored 72

formation of the police system. The separate sections of the police force were merged under Inspector-G-eneral John McLerie, who since his appointment in 1850 as Super 
intendent of Police had held the highest office in that 79 
service. The former superintendents of the various re gional patrols included Scott, Zouch, Chatfield (who had been appointed to the command of the western patrol after 
Battye was dismissed in April 1861 for alleged monetary ir 80 
regularities), and J.A. McLerie, son of the Inspector General, who had been Assistant-Superintendent of the south ern patrol under Zouch. In all, eight superintendents were appointed, four of whom continued in office, together with J.W. Orridge, promoted from the rank of Inspector in 1863, until the end of the period under survey* No others were appointed during this period, and the number of senior 
officers was allowed to undergo a process of natural decrease, 81
