SYNOPSIS 
A fter following with excitement fo r three years the  news of th e gold-rushes in C a lifo rn ia , the c o lo n is ts of  New South Wales found s i m i l a r e x c i t i n g o p p o r t u n i t i e s  su d d e n ly r e v e a l e d i n t h e i r own t e r r i t o r y i n May 1 8 5 1 , when  Edward Hammond H a r g r a v e s made p u b l i c t h e news o f h i s d i s ­ c o v e r ie s n e a r B a t h u r s t .

As a r e s u l t of t h e g r e a t e r p u b l i c i n t e r e s t i n t h e  V ictorian f ie ld s , both in A ustralia and overseas, the  great m ajority of immigrants a ttra c te d by gold went to  t h a t c o lo n y , and New South Wales was s p a r e d th e swamping  of the pre-gold population by immigrants which V icto ria  experienced. Moreover, being the seat of an o ld er, more  f i r m l y e s t a b l i s h e d s o c i e t y t h a n th e d a u g h t e r c o lo n y , New  South Wales was not changed and dominated by th e d ig g e rs  t o th e same d e g re e as V i c t o r i a .

The most o u ts t a n d i n g i n c i d e n t d u r in g t h i s p e rio d was  the s e r i e s of r i o t s at Lambing F la t in 1860-1, when the  diggers combined to drive the Chinese from the f ie ld , and  forced the government to r e s t r i c t Chinese immigration into  the colony. The p r e v a i l i n g element in th ese p roceedings  was n o t one of r e a s o n e d d i s a p p r o v a l o r o f a c t u a l p ro v o c a ­ tio n by the C hinese, but b lin d and p a ssio n a te p re ju d ic e ,  which spread rap id ly from the g o ld -fie ld s to infect the  whole colony u n t i l r e s t r i c t i o n betokened the removal of  the ’menace’ . 
Though th e i n t e r i o r was as a r e s u l t of th e d ig g in g s  t h r u s t i n to th e l i g h t of p u b lic n o t i c e , few of the many  gold se ttlem e n ts survived the gold-rushes to become  t h r i v i n g p r o v i n c i a l c e n t r e s , u n l e s s t h e r e was an economic  need for such a community to serve as a re a l centre fo r  an a g r i c u l t u r a l or p a s t o r a l r e g io n . Such c e n tre s were  served by the communications network which the g o ld -field s  inspired, but the most important requirem ents, such as  roads and railw ays, did not m a te ria liz e as a r e s u lt of
vi 
gold-field pressures. Unlike the Victorians, the New South Wales miners could not muster enough political in fluence to win such amenities. Gold-digging here was of secondary importance. 
There was a strong individualistic strain in many of the diggers, but this very factor made it difficult for the development of militant political groupings of miners, who, until the spread of wage-labour in the 1870s 
took effect, had no inclination to combine for any but the most immediate needs. Political apathy rather than radicalism was the hall-mark of the New South Wales diggers. Their conduct on the fields was generally marked by a greater calmness and peace than was the case In Victoria, though this disappeared in the continuous rush in the western district during the 1860s.

INTRODUCTION 
Since 1851 much labour has been expended upon explana tions of Australia’s debt to her gold-rushes, and the extent to which they influenced the formation of the so-called Australian national character. Poets and bush bards have embraced the subject eagerly, producing soul-stirring works at varying levels of literary merit. These in turn have provoked reactions, though not in verse, the most noteworthy of which is Russel Ward's Australian Legend. But whether or not the heroic form of the legendary ’digger type’ is claimed as the spiritual forefather of the first A.I.F., and whether he was a product of the manly, gold-field way of life, or of the pre-gold ’bush civilization’, there is one factor common to almost all writings and thoughts on gold in Australia; the picture is dominated by Victoria at first, and later adapted to Western Australia. It is drawn in Victoria, and superimposed upon New South Wales. Ballarat and Bendigo, magic names both, appear as typical gold-rush communities. 
This is no recent phenomenon. Even in the early years of the rushes, when the interest of nations - especially those of the United Kingdom - was focussed upon Australia, 
1

’Australia’ to them meant Victoria, or Melbourne and its  satellite gold-fields. It was in Victoria that the great  discoveries of rich auriferous land were made. Ballarat  and Bendigo became famous because their gold deposits were  of unusual value and extent. They were certainly not typic al gold towns, for they remained centres of population even  after the gold had gone, whereas the majority of such settle ments left little but legend for posterity to remember them  by. There was nothing in New South Wales to equal the wealth  of these two. As a producer of gold she could not hope to  rival Victoria, which played by far the greater part in  Australia’s gold story, and events and attitudes there in evitably had the greater effect upon the opinions of ob servers remote in distance or time. Nevertheless, New South  Wales by no means followed the Victorian pattern in every  way. She was by comparison an old-established colony, with  
a history of over sixty years of settlement and consolida 1 
tion. Victoria in mid-1851 was very young and almost empty.  Their respective stories might fairly be distinguished by  a comment that in the 1850s a gold-rush occurred in New  South Wales, while at the same time Victoria was little  else than a self-governing gold-rush. 
1
The official census return gives the population of Victoria  in 1851, before the gold-rushes, as 87,545. 
3 
Most contemporary publications referring to the gold fields are concerned with Victoria alone, and many others mention New South Wales but briefly. More recent general histories, such as E.O.G. Shaun* s Economic History of Australia and 3. Fitzpatrick’s 3ritish Empire in Australia, provide much useful background information, though the sections on gold are again concerned primarily with Victoria. Most local histories, normally compiled to commemorate a jubilee or centenary, are devoid of useful information on this period, though there is no lack of romantic nostalgia for the digging days. Excepted from this condemnation are 
2 
W.A. Bayley’s books on Grenfell, Nundle, Young and Albury, 
though his custom of omitting source references is irritat ing. Donald Friend’s Hillendiana contains much interesting information on the Hill End-lambaroora field, and Ransome 
Wyatt’s History of Goulburn is also useful on this period. An excellent model for useful local histories is provided by the Cooma-Monaro Historical Society’s Historic Kiandra. published in 1959 to mark the centenary of the Kiandra gold-rush. It has no profession to historical comment, but presents a series of extracts from contemporary books and

newspapers. This 'scissors and paste* method of presenting  information does not detract from the enjoyment of the  general reader seeking knowledge of a localized sequence of  events, and is of more value to the working historian than  Bayley’s story-hook type of presentation. 
Very little research work has been done concerning the  history of goldmining in New South Wales. The Regional  Research Monographs, numbers 1 and 5, published in 1950 by  the New England University College, on goldmining around  Armidale and Glen Innes, are very useful, but remain iso lated examples of what needs to be done. The only other  work is in unpublished thesis form, and is very limited in  quantity and scope. Only two are known which deal with New  South Wales, both theses for the degree of M.A. They are  D.F. Mackay's 'Rocky River Gold Field, 1851-67’, and  N.O.P. Pyke's 'Foreign immigration to the gold fields,  N.S.W. and Victoria, 1851-61’. Both proved to be very use ful, especially in providing bibliographical information. 
Documentary material is abundant in the Mitchell  Library, Sydney, but proved to be of no great value. Other  sources were examined at the National Library, Canberra,  the Alexander Turnbull Library and Victoria University Lib rary, Wellington, New Zealand, and the Auckland Public  library.

Victoria's wealth was revealed. The principles of admin istrative methods and practice formulated in the older co lony became the basis for the organization of the Victorian  industry in the important early years. The contribution  of New South Wales was a framework for gold production by  which the chaos which had overtaken California might be  avoided. 
The greatest single influence upon the pattern of  Australian gold-rushes nevertheless came from California. The lengths to which the lure of gold will draw ambitious  men had already been demonstrated more than twenty years  before, in the state of Georgia. Here the Cherokee tribe  of Indians had signed a treaty with the United States go vernment guaranteeing them permanent possession of their  lands. They quickly adopted European customs and way of  life, and established villages, well-run farms, churches,  and commercial enterprises, similar to those of the Americans  around them. But gold was discovered on their land. In  response to urgent prompting by its citizens, the state  government declared that a treaty between an indigenous  tribe and the federal government was not binding upon the  state of Georgia, which had not been consulted. By force  and stratagem the Cherokees were finally removed from their
8 
ancestral lands and deported to the waste lands west of the 
3 
Mississippi, and gold-hungry diggers took their place. 
Another twenty years passed before the modern world's  first major gold-rush took place. As a result of the ex perience and powers of observation of an old Georgian miner,  gold was found and recognized at Sutter's Mill in California 
in 1848. Georgians there demonstrated the art of panning, 4 
and California entered upon her golden age. By the time  Edward Hammond Hargraves discovered gold in New South Wales  in February 1851, the industry was already well developed  in California, where he had learned his trade. Into an al 
most empty, slackly-governed territory, newly captured from  Mexico, poured thousands of adventurers in search of excite ment and wealth. California began to experience action on  a scale and at a rate which few parts of the world had seen  before. With a weak local government, far from the seat of 
power, the immigrants made full use of the opportunities 5 
for free enterprise. Unhampered by restrictions or by law,

What would have happened i n New South Wales had t h e  C alifornian rushes never taken place? Presumably the gold  d e p o s i t s would have b e e n found a t some t i m e . S a t i s f a c t o r y  methods of working them would have been evolved by a process  of t r i a l and e rr o r even had th e re been no 'o ld C a lif o r n ia n s '  t o t e a c h t h e c r a f t and I n tr o d u c e the t o o l s . What fo rm ,  however, would the system of working gold deposits have  taken? This question is p a rtly answered by Gipps' plea to  th e Rev. W.3.

would have worked the gold-fields by wage labour, under a  system similar both to the road-making practice then current  in the colony. In short, the government might have decided  to work the mines as a state monopoly. 
After 1848, this was no longer possible. The impact  of events in California was felt no less in Sydney than in  other parts of the English-speaking world. The exodus from  Sydney caused considerable concern in that city’s press,  with fears of depopulation loudly expressed. At the same  time, the presence of her citizens in California aroused  an almost personal interest in events there. Stirring  things were happening in California. Owing to the lack of  an effective law enforcement body, a crime wave of great  magnitude had appeared both in the mining camps and in the  cities of San Francisco and Sacramento, and was gathering  force in the first months of 1851. Conditions were ideal  for its expansion, with questionable characters from all  nations mingling freely with honest fortune-hunters in a  very fluid society. The group singled out as scapegoats by  the Californian press was that from the penal colonies of  Australia, all immigrants from whence were declared at least  to be tainted by their contacts in Sydney and Hobart even  if they were not actually as dishonest as most of their com patriots. The Vigilance Committees of San Francisco and
11 
Sacramento, which were created to counter lawlessness by implementing the laws of fear and force, seized upon the  Australian menace, and endeavoured to remove it permanent ly. A declaration was issued forbidding immigrants from  Sydney to land unless they had a personal character refer ence from the U.S. consul there. Two of the four men hanged  by the San Francisco committee in 1851 were from Australia.  Y/ild stories about an intended convict takeover of the state  were freely circulated to increase popular agitation, and  
the blame for the many fires which devastated the crowded 8 
wooden cities was laid squarely upon Australian incendiaries. Naturally this anti-Australian hysteria produced its  reaction in Sydney. California was constantly described  as chaos on earth, whose example was to be avoided at all  costs. Californians were depicted as bearded, be-pistoled  savages, whose answer to a fancied insult was invariably a  challenge to a duel. Material gain might be won from gold

rushes, but moral ruin was an inevitable consequence if 9 
California was to be taken as an example. Nevertheless, California was the sample followed, and was the main factor in deciding the course of the Australian rushes. With this example before the people, and news of California being republished in Sydney journals after the arrival of every boat from San Francisco, no government restraint was possible. Australia was to experience full-scale gold-rushes, rather than officially-founded mining settlements. 
But if California was the principal model, it was not copied slavishly in New South Wales. The colony could not under any circumstances be compared with California, for it had a long tradition of ordered government from a strong centre. A paternal government had led it along the path of development, taking a direct interest in all major under takings. Free enterprise was not given its head as in Cali fornia, where little restraint was possible. Sydney con trolled New South Wales as Sacramento was never able to control California during its early rushes. FitzRoy’s gov ernment from the beginning took a detailed interest in gold mining affairs, and its example of official control over all developments was copied by Victoria. In many ways the latter

13 
colony resembled California - it was largely a mining com munity, strong enough to exercise its will, seldom wise  enough to know fully what its will was. New South Wales’  legislation and administration were not always suitable  for Victorian conditions, and a new system had to be evolved  
in Melbourne, though the idea of governmental control re mained. The difference between the two colonies came to be  that with responsible government the miners were in a  position to dictate to the Victorian authorities, but not  to those of New South Wales. 
Hargraves’ announcement in 1851 followed closely the  granting of self-government to New South Wales, and the  separation of Victoria. For five more years government  action was not necessarily bound by a majority decision in  the Legislature. After 1856, however, a government respon sible for its actions to an electorate including large  numbers of diggers had to weigh their opinions against its  actions. In 1858 direct representation was granted to the  miners - the only example of interest-representation outside  the Sydney University seat - and henceforth they elected  three members to the Legislative Assembly. Nevertheless,  governments were seldom dictated to by the miners, whose  influence, potentially so strong, was actually weak through  a lack of political organization. What Victorian miners
14 
were able to express by sheer weight of numbers, those of New South Wales could have achieved only through organiza tion, and this they failed to do. 
Since the colonial government was by tradition expected to take the lead in all important matters, and since it had shown its willingness to assume the role of protector of gold-fields affairs, it was considered to be the govern ment's task to tackle all connected problems to the satis faction of the diggers and those interested in their success. Roads and mail services must be provided and maintained by the government, though country road transport remained the preserve of private enterprise. Railways were expected, though this was not yet to be the railway age in New South Wales. Regulations were formed for the actual control of the diggings, and officers appointed to supervise their operation. Increased immigration, long recognized as a prime need for the colony, brought with it social problems of assimilation, especially in the case of Chinese, which only the government could solve. All these problems were thrust upon a newly self-governing community in addition to the normal problems of recent national maturity, such as taxation and tariff policy, and development of the co lony's other resources.
15 
The pessimism with which pastoralists had received news of the gold discoveries is understandable. The 1840s had not been a happy period for them. Discontinuation of transportation was considered a misfortune which would rob them of controllable labour. While free labour was prefer able, it was not always procurable, and assigned labour had for so long been a stand-by that the abolition of the system was considered an irreparable harm to the pastoral industry. 
Economic slumps during this decade had not helped instil 10 
optimism into the graziers. These, however, were troubles of the 1840s, and by 1851 a recovery was well under way. The prospect of a possible mass desertion of labourers to the gold-fields filled their employers with such dismay that most seemed blinded to the advantages which might accrue to their industry from the increased demand for meat, which the gold-rushes created, and the increased shipping space available for wool and hides in returning emigrant vessels. Their pleas for government intervention to check or control the expected tragedy were inspired by fears that were genuine enough, but, as it proved, mostly needless. Gold, though it was to produce many upsets for the colony, did not bring about its ruin.

Chapter 2 
THE DIGGINGS AND THE DIGGERS 
’An Australian type of mining camp was evolved in the years 1851 to 1858, and it is surprising how each field conformed to this type. The many accounts of the various fields written by observers in the 
’fifties are curiously similar. They tell of the long lines of washers and rockers beside the stream; the field honeycombed with claims In all stages of excavation; the eager feverish toil of men not now working for a master but for themselves; the Com missioner's tent beneath its flag; and the constant altercation of police and diggers over the production of licences. Nightfall was heralded by the "cease work” gun fired from the Commissioner's tent and the twinkle of a thousand fires reddening against the dusk; the lethargy of meal time was followed by the gradually rising chorus of relaxation - here a group sentimentally singing its songs of homeland; there the noisy discord of a gambling dispute; and always the drunken brawling and shouting of those upon whom the sly grog-sellers lived. Finally, as night drew on, there was the contant popping of firearms emptied each night for careful reloading by anxious diggers, and the slow surrender of the pin-points of firelight to the enveloping darkness.'1 
Thus, in truly poetic prose, G.Y. Portus painted his picture of an Australian mining community. Despite his obvious tendency towards romanticism, and the differences imposed upon such settlements by size and location, season

and stage of development, this paragraph contains within it much that was true of most gold-fields. Commissioners, police, and sly-grog sellers form the supporting cast on each, and diggers followed much the same pattern of every day behaviour everywhere. The picture, however, cannot be claimed to give anything more than a vague and general im pression of gold-field society. It describes only the early stages of a rush, without theatre, public-house, or restaurant, and with the Commissioner still quartered under canvas. Cold-fields, like time itself, did not stand still, but went on from phase to phase, changing perhaps according to a general pattern, but each retaining a certain individ ual ity. 
California had figured prominently in the thoughts of the colonists of recent years. They had seen how gold could transform an empty country into a bustling state whose vigour and drive impressed the world even more than the excesses accompanying such a mushroom growth. Through their newspapers and travellers’ tales Australians had a romanticized but clear idea of what was expected of them in the event of gold being discovered in their own country. When Hargraves made his announcement in May his seed was planted in ground that had been well dug and thoroughly prepared, though the rapidity with which the golden beanstalk
18 
grew amazed all and dismayed many who believed their own crops to be in danger of withering under its shadow. The colonists generally did not share this pessimism. Seeing this exotic growth within their own reach - a fairy-tale from a far-off land suddenly re-enacted in all its wonder within their own country - they scrambled to explore and see for themselves, like children on holiday. Every man saw himself in the role of Midas, and gold was ever on his lips until he became disenchanted by cruel experience. 
The road westward to the diggings from Sydney was filled with excited gold-seekers as all who could, includ 
ing ’influential gentlemen’ and ’leading merchants’, made 2 
for the diggings. A Sydney baker announced sadly that ’One of my men has bolted to the digging’s (sic), and being 
short of tools has taken with him the Bakehouse shovels and 3 
flour sieve’. The air of vibrant excitement is well con veyed in a report in the Bathurst Free Press of 24 May. 
At the present time there are about 1,000 people at the mines, and the number is daily increasing. And when it is considered that Ophir is the centre of an immense circle from which many new trodden roads radiate in all directions, and that a steady stream of human beings is daily flowing from each, some idea may be formed of the rapid increase of digging

or themselves constitutionally unfitted, for such enter 7 
prises....’ Disillusioned by the hard work, physical discomfort, and lack of immediate success, those unsuited to life on infant gold-fields returned to their homes. Others stayed, many prospered, and gold digging began to develop from being the subject of an exciting excursion for a few days from Sydney, into a major colonial industry, manned by skilled workers. Some months were to pass, how ever, before the elements of uniformity which this develop ment brought were really established. As yet the gold fields, by now including the Turon as well as Hargraves’ Ophir, were worked in a peaceable manner, ’thereby giving the lie to the wholesale libels which the Californian press 
has heaped upon Australians’, claimed the Bathurst Free 8 
Press proudly. This early crime-free stage did not last long. By 12 July the Empire noted in a leader that, now 
the first excitement had died down, crime was re-appearing 9 
in the ’natural’ manner. The gold-fields were fast becom ing a normal section of colonial life.

If the first phase of the gold-rush period is defined as that during which the colonists of New South Wales flocked to the diggings, sampled the experience of working there, and quickly decided either to remain or to return to their homes, the second is undoubtedly that which began with the influx of adventurers from neighbouring colonies. This was not long delayed. An Empire leader of 23 June describes the arrival in Sydney within 24 hours alone of 
seven vessels from South Australia and Victoria, carrying 10 
238 passengers. Presumably most of those drawn to New South Wales by the lure of gold intended to dig for it them selves, and lost no time in making for the diggings. When news arrived a few months later of the riches of Ballarat, many Victorians returned south, motivated, as the Empire's 
Sofala correspondent uncharitably put it, by the ’natural 11 
desire to crow on one's own dunghill....' 
Immigration was expected to be greatly stimulated by 12 
the gold discoveries, and the colony waited impatiently for the benefits of this to appear. As late as May 1852 - one year after the first rush to Ophir - the Herald was

M e n ’s head were turned with the whirl, and away they plunged, madly diving for gold - a well-behaved, sheep-breeding, sheep-eating, sleek and sober colony, all wool and tallow, comfort and prosperity, became the noisiest country in the world; - talked of, written of, legislated for, envied, abused, praised, coveted, and above all, hurried to - by energy as its own place - by laziness as the shortest road to live without doing anything - by avarice as its heaven - by generosity as the best hope of lifting up the grey head of a ruined father - by money as its market - by poverty as its relief - by theft as the land of plunder - by honesty as a way to pay debts - by vice as an open sphere - by piety as the scene for a mission; - all this rushing in red-hot, and bringing to one point every passion and every project that youth or age, ambition, energy, whim or genius could foment, the whole stirred by the burning hope of gold - gold - gold, has poured itself out - is pouring itself out, on those once peaceful plains, and there is a heaving and sweltering, as when a water-spout is discharged upon the sea.17 
New South Wales was to some extent protected from such a great inundation as Victoria suffered by this very channel ling of the tides of immigration into the southern colony, but the Rev. Mr Arthur’s breathless description sums up diggers’ motivations north of the Murray as well as those in the south. Ambition, restlessness, and desperation drove men of all types and all classes to a common task. As Russel Ward says, newcomers to the diggings sought to hide their inexperience by adopting the dress and mannerisms of the older bushman class which had become standardized before

1851. But there would appear to be little difference between the personal habits and rough clothing of diggers anywhere, whether in California or Australia. They were, it may be inferred, dictated more by expediency than by 
preference, though the presence of a desire to conform can not be denied. 
Diggers in New South Wales were generally of a migra tory tendency. Where there were settled fields with a large community of permanent diggers it was a matter for 
comment, though such fields did exist, a notable example 19 
being the Braidwood area. New discoveries rapidly drew off the population of other nearby fields. Diggers were ever willing to join a rush to a new field on the strength of the slightest rumour. This tendency seemed to increase rather than the reverse as the years passed by, and the diggers became more of a permanent class than a cross-section of colonial society. Professional diggers, with no fixed home or other occupation, might well be expected to be more vulnerable to rumours of better fields further on. The Port Curtis rush, near Rockhampton, was a perfect example of diggers' rootlessness. Rumours circulated of rich and

extensive deposits of gold there at Canoona, and thousands joined the rush, from Melbourne as well as from Sydney, with no thought for anything else. The G-overnor of New South Wales, Sir William Denison, was disgusted. 
I think these rushes speak most unfavourably for the state of the people who are engaged in them. They appear to be bound by no ties; they leave home, wife, children, carried off by a most in tensely selfish spirit; they do not think of any duty which they owe to their country, or to their family, to say nothing of that which they owe to God; but every impulse of their selfish nature is obeyed on the instant.... 20 
The Canoona muddle was not helped by the unduly opti mistic reports of Captain M.C. O ’Connell, the government official in charge of administration of the field. His reports, and those of his colleagues, give glowing accounts of the progress and prospects of the diggings from 26 August well into September, and not until 27 September did he show any sign of worry that the field might not be as promising as first it seemed. One week later he tells of a majority of diggers wishing to return south. 
It is evident that a complete panic has taken 
possession of the minds of all those who have 
hurriedly quitted other occupations in Sydney to hasten hither, tempted by the accounts of the 
quantities' of gold obtained by the first diggers at Canoona; and this feeling of alarm at finding

themselves so far from their homes, without the facility of picking up gold immediately on their arrival, has proceeded to such an extent that the stream of immigration has almost entirely ceased....' ^ 
He goes on to request government aid in further exploring the area around in order to make new ground available for the destitute to work upon. Instead, the Victorian govern ment sent a steamer to bring back those who wished to re turn. In New South Wales the emergency was met by a public fund to assist diggers to be returned to Sydney and resettled in employment upon the gold-fields and elsewhere in the co 
lony, to which diggers as well as others subscribed lib 22 erally. 
O ’Connell’s report as quoted above appears to indicate that many of those involved in the Port Curtis rush were not regular diggers, but inhabitants of Sydney. Regular diggers did not learn the lesson so painfully illustrated, however. Port Curtis was but the forerunner of a long series of similar rushes, each more or less depopulating the previous one. Kiandra was the centre of attraction in 1859-60, Lambing Plat 1860-1, Forbes in 1861, then G-renfell,

were only three dance girls, and those who were  fortunate enough to secure one as partner must have  found it hard work dancing on a floor fully an inch  thick in mud. Just fancy fifty diggers coming into  a room with their muddy boots, and walking about;  what a nice state the floor would be in for dancing. It struck me as a queer sight to see hairy-faced  men in pea jackets, and long boots, with pipes in  their mouths, dancing together. The dance room was  a great attraction, after every dance the landlord  expected each girl to entice her partner to the  bar, to pay for a drink for himself, his partner,  and often-times a friend or two.27 
Horse racing was popular with the diggers at Kiandra as 
elsewhere, and Preshaw tells, with a touch of humour, how 28 
rowdy gangs organized the results to suit themselves. The rush moved on to Lambing Plat, and Preshaw followed it in July 1861. It proved to be still more lawless than Kiandra, though the notorious riots of that year had finished. ’When I first went to the Plat, I have often, when snug in bed, heard some poor fellow, who was being eased of his cash, calling out "Murder” , "Police". In coming home from the 
29

Only the movement of the rush yet again to Porbes improved  the social condition at Lambing Plat, indicating perhaps  that the parasite classes found easier and better pickings

in rush conditions than in settlem ents. C ertainly society  was in a f r e e r s t a t e in th e s e f r o n t i e r c o n d i t i o n s , and t h i s  would b e tt e r s u it the purposes of the law less. 
Although Kiandra, as a re s u lt of its severe climate  and d i f f i c u l t y of acc ess, is perhaps an extreme case even  fo r gold-rush cen tres, which were often beyond the bounds  of normal s e ttle m e n t, Preshaw’s d e s c r ip tio n of i t does  hold good f o r many o t h e r c e n t r e s . The r u s h came, a town sh ip sprang up, dance h a l l , s k i t t l e a l l e y , r a c e - t r a c k , and  b a rs a p p e a re d . Money flow ed as f r e e l y as a l o c h o l , violence  was common, u n t i l rumours o f a new s t r i k e e ls e w h e r e o c c u r r e d ,  and th e r u s h moved on. U n t i l i t had ceased t o be a gold  m etro p o lis, no amount of optimism on the p a rt of i t s in ­ habitants could ensure permanence for a digging township. When t h e r u s h had g o n e, t h e town s u r v i v e d o n ly i f i t was  n ecessary fo r the commerce and a g r ic u ltu r e o f the d i s t r i c t ,  l i k e Young. I f i t was n o t , i t w ith e re d and d ied l i k e Kiandra.  There was l i t t l e d i f f e r e n c e betw een th e New South Wales  rushes of the s i x t ie s and the rushes of C a lifo rn ia and Vic t o r i a in so f a r as d ig g in g s o c i e t y was co n cern ed . I t was  p red o m in an tly m asc u lin e . Community o f i n t e r e s t was shown  only when a s u f f i c i e n t l y b ig issu e a ro s e , such as Chinese  immigration. Otherwise the diggers tended to keep to th e ir  work in small groups, e a tin g , drinking, and making very
32 
merry when they could afford it. The police were not over efficient, but there was never any need to resort to Cali 
fornian lynch law, which had been necessary there to offset 30 
the lack of an efficient law-enforcement body. Isolated from the gold-fields by the great distances of New South Wales, Sydney never became, as Melbourne rapidly did, the focal point of the diggings. In New South Wales no such focal point ever existed, since the diggings were spread over the whole eastern part of the colony - a region some 900 miles long and 250 miles wide. Though this was roughly divided into three regions for administrative purposes, the real divisions were smaller, with a centre such as Braidwood or Armidale for the diggings in its vicinity, and very little sense of any greater community. Only the main rush of the sixties, beginning at Kiandra and rolling northwards from gold-field to gold-field, resembled the Victorian picture of a cohesive body of diggers. 
Life In the mining settlements, as distinct from the later standardized rushes, varied of course, from year to year and according to geographical location. A study of reports from and comments on such settlements, however,

While a settlement was flourishing , the diggers did not lack sources of entertainment. Travelling circuses and minstrel shows toured the various gold-fields to gather 
their share of the rapidly-circulating produce of the dig 37 
gings. Not for long were the diggers to rely on hurdy 38 gurdy, Punch and Judy, and improvised concerts, though a 
projected theatre at Sofala had to be abandoned in November 39 
1851, its timber being sold to build an Anglican church.  Organized prize-fights were popular in the masculine atmos 
phere of the early diggings, and attempts by the forces of 40 
the law to stamp it out appear to have met with no success.  Turon diggers showed a blood-lust unusual even for the

around to see an organized fight between a sheep-dog and 41 
a bull-dog. 
For every mining township, however, the day eventually came when skittle-alley and billiard-room were silent, the bulk of the diggers having moved on, and those remaining behind being too sober-minded or too poor to turn their minds to lighter things. 
During the last three months the inhabitants of the Lachlan have been put to their wits’ end to find anything amusing. Previously there had been 
theatres in existence where the multitude could pass an evening and obtain a shilling’s worth of tragedy or comedy, and bad grog at sixpence a glass. Latterly, matters are assuming a more serious turn, and religious tea meetings and 
Christian associations are coming into vogue. Luring the prosperous days of the town the people were given to frivolity and excesses of various kinds; but, as adversity approaches, they seem to fly for refuge to something more substantial and serious.42 
But before such oppressive mid-Victorian morality overtook them in their declining years, the gold-fields were the scene of such excesses as to make it almost a natural re action to expect. Where there were diggers there was al cohol, and if it could not be obtained legally there were

to check the sly-grog trade fo r a while, but the oppor tu n itie s for rapid accumulation of wealth proved too tempt ing for such a check to be permanent.

Mining was n o t p e r m i t t e d on a Sunday, and t h i s came t o be the general re c re a tio n day on the diggings. Apart from 
drinking, gambling appears to have been the most popular  45 46 
p a stim e, w ith 'tw o-up' e a r l y making i t s appearance. The  e v i l which aro u sed most i n d i g n a t i o n was n e i t h e r of t h e s e ,  nor was i t p r i z e - f i g h t i n g , b ra w lin g , and o t h e r manly s p o r t s .

keepers and to buy p ro v is io n s . Most s to re s were open to 47 
accommodate them. Prom time to time p u b lic opinion and 
the press were so outspoken in th e ir disapproval th a t the 48 
p ractice stopped, only to begin again sh o rtly a fte r . In October 1851 a l l Turon storekeepers were reported to have 
been persuaded to sign a pledge not to open th e ir e s ta b lis h - 49

In r e l i g i o u s observance on th e d i g g i n g s , as i n much  e lse, the diggers began eagerly only to fade as time went  on. I t is lik e ly th at the re lig io u s enthusiasm of the early  y e a rs , when co n g reg atio n s were la rg e and clergymen r e l a t i v e ­
