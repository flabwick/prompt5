A RESOURCE REBELLION:  
AVOIDING A POLITICAL RESOURCE CURSE  DURING THE GOLD RUSH 
Martin Emmet O’Donnell 
In the last decade, political economy theorists have reinvigorated the  resource curse thesis by supplementing the work of mainstream economists. This literature has become known as the political resource  curse and has as its focus the often detrimental interplay of resources  booms and political institutions. Victoria, which forged its democracy  upon a gilded crucible, the gold rush, presents a unique puzzle for this  literature. By re-examining Victoria’s early democratic advancements  through the prism of the political resource curse, this article concludes that  ideational as well as material causal mechanisms, when underpinned by  energetic political and economic contention, can be crucial in alleviating  the worst impulses of a political resource curse.  
As the gold rush collided with a previous resource boom, pastoral land, a  wave of gold-rush immigration sparked both economic and political  contention. Such contention helped to alleviate the worst impulses  embedded within a resource curse. Material causal mechanisms – in  particular, the management and composition of alluvial gold – sparked  economic contention, laying the foundation for emboldened immigrants to  voice their demands. Chartism armed social forces with a coherent rhetoric  that shaped the character of Victorian political contention; when a  constituency has both the ability and the interest to demand better  institutions, ideas can equip a citizenry with a cohesive framework to  advance their political contention, helping to mitigate the institutional  deterioration that can result from resource booms. The theoretical

implications of this observation call for the political resource curse  literature to better appreciate the interplay of ideas upon a resource curse.  
Methodology 
This article has both economic and political contention as its focus. The  first factor, economic contention, has as its foundation the material world  as a causal factor. The second, political contention, has as its foundation  ideas as causal factors. At the centre of this article is the political resource  curse: which by its very nature rests upon the notion that material factors  act as prime causal elements. In examining economic contention, this  article will draw upon the vast and well-established literature that looks to  material factors as underpinning social change and individual incentives.  However, in mapping out an argument for political contention the article must address ideational causal elements as a factor for change.  
The gold rush in Victoria is a period of changing material and ideational  factors smashing their way through a kinetic period of history. Materially,  it is a clash of two distinct economic resource shocks (pastoral land and  alluvial gold fields). Politically, Australia saw its population triple in a  mere decade. These immigrants hauled new ideas to Australia’s shores and  the proceeding ideational diffusion was brisk. Ultimately, the economic  and political contention, the material and ideational factors, are intimately  connected, consummated by facts of time and place. One does not exist - nor does one remain the same – without the other.  
Process tracing, as a case study methodology, allows one to uncover  ideational causal mechanisms that exist between historically documented  independent and dependent variables. It seeks to avoid temporal  sequencing or pattern tracing from X to Y; its efforts are more ambitious:  to map the causal mechanism that exists (transient and veiled) between X  and Y. This article will employ Beach and Pedersen’s (2013) process  tracing methodology that focuses on explaining outcomes. Such a  technique allows one to make within-case determinations as to the  presence of ideational causal mechanisms. Furthermore, this article will  draw upon Sheri Berman’s (2001) three stage proposal for determining the  impact of ideational theory in social change. First, one must determine  why one particular idea rose to prominence. Second, one must map the  ideas' ability to maintain longevity or significance. Third, one must address  the degree of influence of the idea. This methodology – an amalgamation

of explaining-outcome process-tracing and Berman’s three stage  ideational framework – will be applied to a single ideational causal  mechanism: Chartism. 
Early Australian economic and political development 
The reasons for the British colonisation of Australia are hotly debated,  ranging from military and economic imperatives after the loss of the  American colonies, to domestic economic and population concerns  (Fletcher 1976: 17-21). Whether the forced emigration of convicts was the  impetus or not, once the decision to colonise Australia had been made, it  is clear that convicts were carefully selected in accordance with the needs  of an infant settlement. By and large, the convicts were of a high calibre,  mostly skilled and evenly divided into distinct areas of expertise;  furthermore, they had been sentenced to a minimum of seven year terms - a suitable time frame for colonial development (Meredith and Oxley  2005). Non-convict immigrants were not a significant contributing factor  in the economy until the 1820s (McLean 2013: 45). The UK military  administered a virtual command-economy structure over the fledgling  settlement, and the skilled convicts were a perfect source of cheap labour.  Between 1788 and 1866 (when convict transportation to Australia ended),  a total of 139,000 men and 26,000 women were transported to Australian  shores to serve various criminal sentences (Tuffin 2013: 1-12). Not only  did the convicts possess many skills appropriate to the construction of a  colony, but the colony’s workforce participation rate was maximised due  to its gender, age, and physical condition (McLean 2013: 45). The colony  was freed from the responsibilities of care of children and the elderly.  Healthy, young, skilled men made up the core of the colony, and they were  put to work the moment they landed (McLean 2013: 46). The colony was  bolstered with generous financial subsidies from the UK to fund imports  (Steven 2000: 49). In order to self-finance its growth the colony embarked  on a ‘search for a staple’; an item that could be exported cheaply,  efficiently, and in large volumes to foreign markets (McLean 2013: 50).  
Australia soon found its staple: wool. In the early 1820s, large grasslands  were colonised in the central-west of the New South Wales colony; the  appropriation of this fertile land heralded Australia’s first resource boom  (Fletcher 1976: 118). The underlying factor endowments of the settlement  matured from being a labour-, capital- and land-scarce settlement to 
A RESOURCE REBELLION 35 
labour- and capital-scarce but land-abundant (McLean 2013: 59). With  land effectively priced at zero a ‘squattocracy’ prospered. Capital inputs  were virtually non-existent, excepting the sheep, which themselves  reproduced. Squatters drew heavily on convict labour, depressing initial  wages (Steven 2000: 48). Wool – as a light, non-perishable, high value  good – was a cost-efficient option for transportation from land to port  (without the need for capital investment in costly roads or train tracks)  (McLean 2013: 61). It required few peripheral industries; the wool was  unprocessed, packed into bales, and exported as such. Under such  conditions wool became the primary export for Australia over 130 years  (1820s to the 1950s [excluding the primacy of gold in the 1850s/60s])  (McLean 2013: 58).  
Squatters, who controlled the land, and drew heavily from indentured  labour, dominated the colonial economy, and consequently, sought to  dominate its nascent political structures. Squatters became incentivised to  work together resulting in group enforcement in matters of boundary  contestation and political arbitration (Alston et al. 2012). A cohesive and  powerful political block developed. In 1823, a Legislative Council was  created in New South Wales consisting of seven appointed members; in  1842, the Council expanded to 12 nominated and 24 elected members  (with suffrage extended to voters meeting certain property-qualifications)  (McLean 2013: 63-4). Half of the members of the first three Legislative  Councils ‘were shareholders of the Australian Agricultural Company’  (Normington-Rawling 1963: 13). More importantly, rural areas secured  three-quarters of the members whilst the burgeoning towns were left with  only a quarter (the inverse of their population differences). In 1850,  Australian Legislative Councils were required by the British Parliament to  be ‘one-third nominated and two-thirds elected’, however, in constructing  the first constitution, squatters sought provisions such as ‘a nominated  upper house, the perpetuation of unequal electorates, and a restricted  franchise favouring property owners’ (McLean 2013: 64). In both form  and content, through property and rural franchises, squatters entrenched  their political dominance (Fletcher 1976: 148). 
The squatter’s distortion of political institutions extended beyond the  houses of parliament. Squatters in Australia violently displaced the  Indigenous population and illegally secured their claims. Heavily armed  police, who took their orders from pastoralist-dominated magistrates, were  tasked with ‘overcoming Aboriginal resistance to dispossession’  (McCulloch 1999). Their goal was to protect squatters and open up new 
36 JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL ECONOMY No 89 
land. Victorian police forces continued to protect squatter interests (at the  expense of Aboriginal communities, small farmers, labourers and  independent miners) well into the 19th century (McCulloch 1999).  Squatters sought to legitimise their land holdings in the 1830s, long after  the land was procured and after they had secured the colony’s political  institutions. By 1850, 2000 squatters in New South Wales accounted for  73 million acres of land (Fletcher 1976: 117). 
As the convict trade dwindled, squatters sought to protect their interests  through the domination of social, political, and economic systems and  rent-seeking behaviour. There were attempts to import indentured labour  from India for use in New South Wales and Victoria (McLean 2013: 132).  From the mid-1830s to the 1850s ‘scarcely a year passed without’ a  scheme being devised by the squattocracy to legalise forms of bonded labour and other such practices (Roberts 1935: 337). The first effort was  the creation of the Immigration Committee of 1837, which ‘spoke of the  colony crumbling into an abyss if some 10,000 labourers were not soon  forthcoming’ (Roberts 1935: 337).  
The institutional capture that the squattocracy achieved was immense. The  Australian economic and political landscape of the 1840s consisted of a  single-industry economy powered by convict-labour, with little regard for  property rights, and a political system engineered to limit the franchise. At  this curious historical juncture, it would have been hard to imagine  Australia, a mere decade later, fashioning a democracy that would be the  envy of the world.  
The gold rush: A resource curse? 
Countless studies have chronicled the development of Victoria’s  democratic institutions. This artricle does not seek to revive the tale of  Australia’s democratic birth, rather, it seeks to re-examine it against the  resource curse literature. The resource curse literature continues to flourish  well into the twenty-first century as political-economy theorists  reinvigorate the theory by mapping the interplay between political  institutions and resource endowments. W. Max Corden and J. Peter Neary  (1982) developed an economic model, the Dutch Disease, in response to  the 1970s crises that emanated from supply-side shocks born of large  resource endowments. They hypothesised an economic model of two  tradable sectors (boom and non-boom) and a third non-tradable sector. 
A RESOURCE REBELLION 37 
When an economy is ensnared by a Dutch Disease, labour costs and the  real exchange rate rise resulting in the non-boom sector being crowded  out.  
The negative economic effects of a resource boom were further developed  in what came to be known as the Resource Curse, a term first used by  Richard Auty (1993). Scholarly research which scrutinised the link  between large resource endowments and stagnant growth proliferated  throughout the following decade (Ross 1999). The resource curse  expanded its economic analysis to highlight the role of transnational  companies, terms-of-trade alterations, volatility in taxes and income, and  the rise of emboldened resource-rich elites as all contributing to stagnant  growth outcomes (Goodman and Worth 2008: 203). These studies  culminated in the mid-90s in a discussion paper presented by Jeffrey D.  Sachs and Andrew M. Warner (1995) that applied regression analysis to  ninety-seven states and asserted that a ‘high ratio of natural exports to  GDP’ is correlated with depressed growth rates.  
The gold rush in Victoria comprises the single largest mining boom  relative to GDP in Australia’s history (McLean 2013:.81). The years 1851  – 1861, the Golden Age (Geoffrey Serle (1963), encompass the most  pivotal period of economic shock and political contestation in Victoria; as  such, it is these years which shall define the parameters of this paper.  Within this decade, Australia’s population trebled to a total of 1.1 million  people. The primacy of its economic success was in Victoria, where its  population increased nine-fold (Littlejohn 2013: 20). Gold mining at its  peak, one year after its discovery, comprised 35% of Australian GDP.  Within two years, wages had risen across Australia by 250% (Maddock  and McLean 1984: 1049). By the third year, the Victorian Gold Discovery  Committee concluded that gold ‘has made this the richest country in the  world; and, in less than three years, it has done for this colony the work of  an age’ (The Sydney Morning Herald 28 March 1854: 2). As the flood of  immigrants urbanised, Australia experienced a housing boom and the  subsequent economic benefits that stem from rapid urbanisation (Cross  1996: 5). High marriage and birth rates followed, and urban areas proved  fertile ground for economic growth well into the future (Fahey 2010: 160).  High overseas transportation costs incentivised local manufacturing  industry growth in support of the rapidly developing economy (Fahey  2010: 150). 
38 JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL ECONOMY No 89 
In managing the boom, the government constructed a license fee to restrict  labour fleeing from other industries to the fields. It operated as an effective  barrier to entry, yet only had to be paid monthly, allowing for flexibility in  the movement of labour from the fields and back to the farms (McLean  2013: 84). The gold license fee - most notoriously associated with the  Eureka Stockade – was a regressive tax that had to be paid whether gold  was discovered or not. Further, the government regulated the size of  mining plots to ‘12-feet square, about one-fortieth of Californian practice’  (Maddock and McLean 1984: 1062). The unusually small size of the  claims would result in portentous long-term effects including a relatively  even distribution of wealth, ensuring an avoidance of gold mining  monopolies and syndicates.  
Ian W. McLean (2004, 2013) has investigated whether the economic  ailments identified in resource curse literature surfaced throughout the  gold gush, concluding that in the short-term, Victoria exhibited elements  of the curse, however, over the long-term, the gold rush contributed to a  sustained rise in prosperity. Rodney Maddock and Ian McLean (1984)  found that Victoria did indeed experience a Dutch Disease; however, the  effects were mitigated by the huge immigration boom that followed,  coupled with Australia’s ability to stymie outflow immigration as the  boom faded. Warwick E. Murray and Richard P. Willis (2010) have  examined the role of settler capitalism in both Australia and New Zealand  in mitigating a resource curse; including: imperial preferences, the  abundant reserves of ‘free’ land, high wages, and the ‘egalitarian’ nature  of settler colonies. Ultimately, Australia awoke from the gold rush in a  healthier economic position than it had begun (McLean 2013) avoiding the  worst excesses of an economic resource curse.  
The gold rush: A political resource curse? 
By the early 2000s, scholarship began to scrutinise the political  implications of resource endowments with a focus on the interplay of  resources and institutions (Ross 2015). These ideas came to be known as  the political resource curse. Such literature posited that the interplay of  resource revenues and institutions is often correlated with corruption  (Brollo et al. 2013), an increase in rent-seeking behaviour (Hook Law et  al. 2014), the concentration of wealth, the deterioration of the state (Luong  and Weinthal 2006), and less political competition (Goldberg et al. 2008). 
A RESOURCE REBELLION 39 
These adverse outcomes are the product of ‘grabber-friendly institutions,  where rent-seeking and production are competing activities’ in contrast to  ‘producer-friendly institutions, where rent-seeking and production are  complementary activities’ (Mehlum et al. 2006: 2-3). Underpinning good  governance institutions is the rule of law, particularly regarding property  rights (Luong and Weinthal 2006; Brunnschweiler 2008). Further, the  incentives of political leaders during a resource boom can become skewed  as resource rents raise ‘the value of being in power and [provide]  politicians with more resources which they can use to influence the  outcome of elections’ (Robinson et al. 2006: 466). Further, as governments  experiences an inflow of rents, they are freed ‘from levying taxes’, and  thus released ‘from the accountability ordinarily exacted’ by a domestic  tax regime (Herb 2005: 298).  
Andrew Rosser (2007) highlights the role of ‘social forces in shaping  economic policy making in resource abundant countries’ (Rosser 2007:  41): concluding that the successful management of a resource boom is  driven in large part by social structural forces. Democratic demand side 
factors are often neglected in the study of a resource curse; however, they  play a pivotal role, and it is crucial that in overcoming a resource curse,  ‘societal actors […] have both the interest and ability to make a credible  demand for [good governance institutions]’ (Luong and Weinthal 2006:  254). Often, it is a plurality of political and economic contention that can  best limit a resource curse from taking hold (Goldberg et al. 2008).  
The political resource curse literature is also concerned with a rise in  insecurity and civil conflict in resource dependent states. There is a  correlation between the location and character of the resource. When  resources are closer to poorer regions, or marginalised ethnic groups, then  civil conflict becomes more likely (Ross 2015: 251). Such conflict was rife  during both Australia’s pastoral and gold resource booms. A direct  correlation in Australia between the rush to resources and resulting conflict  can be drawn (Steven 2000: 63). Squatter expansion across Australia  unleashed violence against the indigenous population; and when the land  revealed its gold, violence was sanctioned with the same unrelenting  passion. Victoria’s gold rush saw an unequivocal rise in civil conflict  between the prospectors and the traditional owners of the land (Boucher  2013; Miller 2015). The Australian Aboriginal population declined rapidly  throughout the 1850s (Boucher 2013: 97). By the mid-1850s, the  Committee Appointed to Enquire in the Condition of the Aborigines was  created, at the request of Legislative Council member, Thomas 
40 JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL ECONOMY No 89 
McCombie, who observed in 1856 that there was ‘scarcely a spot… where  the aborigine could rest his weary feet […] Victoria is now entirely  occupied by a superior race’ (Boucher 2013: 97).  
Australia’s first resource boom (land) exhibited many of the elements of a  political resource curse. However, Australia’s second great boom (gold)  heralded Australia’s democratic birth. It is this economic contention  between pastoralists and diggers (material causal factors) which provided  the stage upon which political contention could rage (ideational causal  factors).  
Chartism and writing Australian history 
Many scholars have meticulously documented the role of immigrants in  advancing transnational agendas and promoting an egalitarian ethos at the  Eureka Stockade including American Republicanism (Potts and Potts  1968: 145-64), Methodist Cornish Miners (Fahey 2008), Irish Catholics  (Currey 1954), and the influence of Chinese diggers (Gittins 1981). Yet,  only recently has the influence of UK Chartism been examined in detail.  
The politics of early Australian history is not easily severed from the  politics of today; when we speak of Australia’s nativity, it can be difficult  to discern if the narrative one weaves has as its purpose historical  observation, or the advancement of a contemporary doctrine. A troubled  history, both young and rather artificial, is particularly prone to  contestation. Such controversy has come to be known in Australia as the  ‘History Wars’ (Clark and Macintyre 2004). This ideological baggage may  go some of the way to explain the apparent neglect of appreciation for  Chartist ideational influence within colonial Victoria. Chartism, as a failed  yet radical working-class British movement, is not the institution of the  motherland which the ultra-conservative right most wish to proselytise on.  Its’ very British nature also sits just as uneasy with the old labour-Left,  who welcomed many foreigners into the narrative of Eureka (and kept just  as many out), however, never quite lost their antipathy for the empire. 
It is only recently that Chartism, and its effects upon Australia, has enjoyed  renewed scrutiny. Kirsty Reid has sought to understand the psychology of  individuals who carried Chartist ideas with them to the shores of Australia  (Reid 2008). Other scholars, whilst seeking to establish a wider 
internationalist tent from which Australian democracy was born, now  acknowledge the contribution of Chartist principles as underpinning 
A RESOURCE REBELLION 41 
Victorian democracy (Beggs-Sunter 2008). Paul Pickering has engaged in  the most energetic attempts to re-situate Chartist ideas within Australian  colonial development: examining colonial-Australian Chartist ideas in  communication with the wider British world (Pickering 2003), arguing  that Australia provided a malleable political-space for Chartists to advance  their ideological ambitions (Pickering 2011), and seeking to more  coherently map their historical influence (Pickering 2001). 
Political contention and Chartism: 1851-1860. 
Victoria separated from New South Wales and became its own formal  colony in 1851. It was granted a limited form of self-government  comprised of a single house: the Legislative Council, with twenty  members elected (suffrage was extended to literate male constituents, over  the age of 21, who met discriminative property requirements) and a further  ten members assigned by the Governor, a British appointee (Table Office  2009). Rural pastoral interests were decisively favoured in the parliament  with only seven members representing the heavily populated regions of  Melbourne and Geelong (Table Office 2010). The primary goal of this  Council was to draft Victoria’s constitution; they would succeed in this  goal by 1855, and it was approved by the British government with its  implementation in 1856 (Table Office 2009). The constitution prescribed  a Westminster system of two houses: a Legislative Council and a  Legislative Assembly, and an appointed Governor who acted on advice of  the parliament (Table Office 2009). Utterly unknown to the colony at the  time, the drafting of its constitution would play out against the background  of the gold rush and the flood of new immigrants. As a consequence,  Victoria’s constitution would see radical political innovations such as  secret ballot introduced, and provision for a fully elected parliament (Table  Office 2009).  
In 1858, Legislative Council member McCombie noted that Victoria had  transformed itself from ‘a perfect despotism […] to the very opposite point  of democracy’ (Boucher 2013: 83). Victoria had far exceeded the  democratic achievements of its ‘motherland’. By 1861, full manhood  suffrage (1859), a secret ballot (1856), the abolition of the property  qualification for the lower house (1857), and shorter parliaments (1858- 
1859) had all been achieved (Pickering 2001). No substantial  improvements could be made regarding skewed constituencies favouring 
42 JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL ECONOMY No 89 
rural interests and gender restrictions. Chinese immigrants found their  freedoms to be further restricted and the Indigenous population continued  to have their basic rights restricted. However, in many regards, Victoria  accomplished democratic constitutional change considered radical in  England: it advanced good governance institutions, fortified the rule of  law, expanded the franchise and facilitated political competition, all  helping to limit rent-seeking behaviour by vested interests. It is this paper's  argument that this dramatic political evolution was driven in large part by  an ideational agenda framed, shaped, and propelled by Chartist ideas. 
The political institutions of 1851 Victoria had sought to fortify the interests  of the pastoral community. However, over the next decade these same  political institutions had to contend with a mass of new immigrants. With  the squattocracy unwilling to cede power to the demands of this new  constituency, the immigrants perceived their economic and political  security to be at risk. Chartist ideas bestowed a flexible rhetoric with which  the new immigrants could voice a coherent political opposition that went  to the heart of their material grievances. The deployment of this ideational  force allowed new immigrants to enact short-term political reforms, whilst  the Chartist-inspired language of agrarian-equality provided an amenable  framework to stage long-term cohesive opposition to pastoral interests.  
Chartism, a class-based democratic movement that originated in England,  was formed around six core demands first voiced in 1777 when John  Cartwright published ‘The Legislative Rights of the Commonalty  Vindicated’ (Rosenblatt 1916: 23). These ideas were not new, and Chartists  looked to a wide array of political movements and historical texts in order  to bolster their claims (Rosenblatt 1916). The six demands, published in  The People’s Charter (from which Chartism takes its name) include:  universal male suffrage, the elimination of property qualifications for  members of parliament, annual elections, equal constituencies, payment  for MPs, and a secret ballot (Sawer 2001: 2). As Chartist ideas floundered  in the UK, they found amicable recipients amongst the diggers of the Victorian goldfields, and quickly rose to prominence with a swift and  energetic resolve. The gold rush brought a substantial contingent of  Chartists to the mining fields (Sawer 2001). Their links to the diggings,  miner newspapers, and political organisation has been well chronicled  (Messner 1999). 
A RESOURCE REBELLION 43 
The political issues that dominated Victoria differed greatly to the issues  that gripped England a decade earlier; however, Chartism provided a  flexible framework that allowed the citizenry of Victoria to voice their  unique discontent. The immediate issue vexing miners was taxation, and  the aggressive government tactics deployed to enforce it. However, the  dominant issue, which evolved over the decade, was that of land. The  squattocracy, who were seen as the key enemy of democracy, aggressively  sought to ratify their unsanctioned claims (Miller 2015). As the new  immigrants sought to permanently settle, their hopes for success rested  upon more equitable access to farmland. Underlying both these areas of  contention (taxes and land) was dissatisfaction with a political system  trapped by special interests. It was the political institutions of Victoria - that taxed new immigrants regressively, yet, implemented policies in  favour of the squattocracy – that incited discontent. The fundamentals of  a parliamentary system proved desirous to the majority of the population,  yet, the structural incentives, governed by a limited franchise that favoured  rural constituents, proved unacceptable to the colony’s new inhabitants.  
It is within this world that Chartist ideas rose to prominence. On the 11th  of November 1854, 15,000 people gathered at The Ballarat Reform League  to protest the miner’s licence fee (Beggs-Sunter 2008). By the end of the  meeting, they had transcribed their own Charter that contained five  demands drawn directly from UK Chartism: ‘full and fair representation,  manhood suffrage, no property qualification of Members for the  Legislative Council, payment of Legislative Members, and shorter  duration of Parliament’ (Ballarat Reform League Charter 2015). Requiring  a framework to express their material grievances, the diggers of Ballarat  looked to Chartism. Chartist ideas became the elemental ideational force  propelling democratic demands in Victoria. The diffusion of Chartist ideas  amongst miners was driven both by a process of rapid learning and  emulation. By drawing upon demands previously established by the UK  Charter, miners were provided with a framework which defined their end  goal and diffused it as shared knowledge. Chartism, as an idea, became not  just a roadmap, but a final destination.  
By 1861, Victoria had made substantial progress towards fulfilling three  of the five demands of the Ballarat Reform League Charter, including full  male suffrage (1859), reductions in property qualifications (1857), and  shorter parliaments (1858-1859) (Pickering 2001: 36). Gold rush inflation  also played a significant role in rendering the property qualification for  manhood suffrage inconsequential, quickening its demise (Hirst 1988: 
44 JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL ECONOMY No 89 
103). Although efforts to unburden miners of the licence fee were shot  down at Eureka Stockade, full manhood suffrage was achieved, nullifying  the tension resulting from taxation without representation. It was only with  regards to payment of members and fair representation (skewed rural  constituencies) that progress stalled. As such, these issues continued to  cultivate considerable contestation (Scalmer 2011). However, Chartist  ideas had institutionalised themselves with rapid speed and, now  normalised, expectations evolved.  
As land became the dominant issue, political rhetoric became infused with  Chartist ideology in the fight against squatter interests. Chartist ideas,  which developed in Europe as much against idle landholding aristocrats as  against industrial capitalists, was steeped in a language of agrarian equality  and natural rights to land (Goodman 1988: 33). Australia’s material  conditions proved to be fertile ground for the pre-industrial flavoured  Chartist philosophy. In Victoria, as the gold rush petered out, immigrants  looked to land to secure their opportunity for economic independence. A  language that spoke to ‘natural rights’ proliferated amongst Victorian  immigrants. Chartist language created a form of rhetorical momentum that  worked to redefine the terms of debate. A vocabulary that spoke to agrarian  equality equipped new immigrants with a language that reshaped their  conception of fundamental rights. Through expanding miners' rhetorical  depth, the language of Chartism opened up new political possibilities. 
Local meetings addressing land reform became common as Chartist  inspired ‘leaders of the anti-licence movement, including J. F. Sullivan, W.  D. C. Denovan, John Macintyre and Angus Mackay’ led the land reform  fight (Fahey 2008: 170). Political agitation grew throughout the 1850s,  with breakouts of violence common (Shaw 1973). Protest culminated in  the Victorian Land League and the Land Convention of 1857. Chartists had  been forming land associations in the UK since the 1840s (Pickering 2003:  88); and political agitation in Victoria mirrored many of the same tactics  employed by Chartists in the UK. The Victorian Land League and the Land  Convention of 1857 ‘organised hundreds of public meetings and many  demonstrations’ over the next two years (Scalmer 2011: 345). By mid 1858, parliament responded with a reform-bill seeking to distribute land  in a more equitable manner. Although it was rejected by the Upper House  (where pastoral interests dominated), 20,000 marched on Parliament and  riots broke out; still, the Upper House did not budge, and prorogued itself  for half a year until quiet fell back upon Victoria (Scalmer 2011: 346). The  conservative-leaning Melbourne newspaper, The Argus (2 June 1858: 1), 
A RESOURCE REBELLION 45 
declared that such agitation resulted from ‘combative Chartists  [pronouncing] noisy harangues on the wrongs of the people’ (Shaw 1973:  550). Two years later, in 1860, crowds again stormed Parliament in protest  against a second land reform bill, and once again, they were pushed back  and violently dealt with (Shaw 1973: 556).  
The Ballarat Reform League Charter achieved success in three of its five  Chartist-inspired aims throughout the 1850s. Success was limited in the  fight against the remaining two: land redistribution and more equal  electoral constituencies. By and large, squatters managed to protect their  core material interests throughout the 1850s. However, squatters saw their  political power diminish over subsequent decades. In large part, this future  success is due to the early democratic reforms achieved in the 1850s.  Chartism comprised the crucible in which early Australian democracy  came to be forged. By securing popular democratic control of the Lower  House of Parliament, a generally peaceful (if slow) resolution of the land  issue transpired over the next four decades.  
Overcoming a resource curse: Political and economic contention 
Ultimately, the story of 1850s Victoria is a story of political and economic  contention. Core material interests motivated the contention, yet ideational  rhetoric helped to consolidate a coherent opposition. Before 1851,  Australia was an economy dominated by wool with a governance structure  skewed towards pastoral interests. Over the course of the decade, it  became an economy dominated by gold and a world leader in democratic  governance. Two sides fought it out. The squattocracy sought to secure  their land holdings, maintain a cheap labour force, and ensure their  dominance of political institutions. They hoped to hoard wealth amongst a  few and build ‘grabber-friendly institutions’ diminishing economic  competition. The new immigrants sought to open up land, fortify their  labour rights, and muscle their way into governance. They pursued  ‘producer friendly institutions’ inciting economic competition.  
Many of the key material causal factors that resulted in Victoria  overcoming an economic resource curse also helped to contain a political  resource curse. The allotment size of the claims and the geological nature  of alluvial gold resulted in a paucity of wealth concentration and promoted  mass immigration. The equitable material foundations worked to contain  uneven distribution of rents, limiting the advancement of corruption, rent-

seeking and patronage behaviour. This helped to ensure the gold rush did  not have a corrosive or corrupting effect on political institutions.  Furthermore, the gold rush did not see huge resource rents flow to the  government – a key component that abets a political resource curse – 
rather, it saw the opposite, as the governments of the colonies financed  themselves with large loans from the UK (McLean 2013: 82).  Buttressed by this equitable distribution of wealth, the new immigrants  sought to enshrine their future rights through democratic participation and  equal access to land. It is here that we see the influence of ideational forces  in shaping the political institutions that manage a resource boom.  Victoria’s achievements in advancing democratic institutions lay in  rigorous political competition. As one resource boom balanced another,  gold made Victorian politics competitive. A homogenous constituency,  emboldened by new wealth from the gold rush, and with access to  rhetorical channels of democratic reform, were ready to fight. These social  forces clothed themselves in a powerful idea: Chartism, which experienced  a rapid rise on the gold fields as it diffused amongst the miners. Chartism  gave shape to political ambitions and provided a roadmap to achieve them. Chartism achieved swift success in advancing three of its five demands.  However, land reform revealed itself to be a more stubborn beast. It proved  too difficult to wrest control from the pastoral community its key material  interest. Yet, early achievements in democratic reform eventually secured  the slow dissolution of the squattocracy. Chartism, with its rhetorical and  ideational cohesion, allowed for persistent political contention throughout  the decade. Perhaps one of the lessons to take from this particular case  study is that entrenched constituencies are almost always unwilling to  relinquish their material interests, but, if the focus is on the advancement  of democratic institutions generally, then those same interests might find  themselves unwittingly acquiescing to their eventual decay.  
Conclusion  
Many propose that the march of liberal history in Australia was inevitable:  a gift from the UK, natural to the population and always welcome on  Australia’s shores. While it is true that the foundations of constitutional  democracy were laid before the gold rush, so were the more autocratic  foundations of the early squatter-elite. Evidently, the gold rush ignited  political and economic contention that moderated the squatters’ worst

impulses. By nurturing competition, it mitigated the rent-seeking  behaviour so common to a resource curse. Such competition is not only  the foundation of long-term stable economic growth, but also of healthy  political competition.  
Political competition relies on a push and pull as disenfranchised actors  demand change and powerful elites object to supplying it. Often following  a resource boom, elites fortify their strength, limiting their willingness to  supply what is coveted. Yet in Victoria, the gold rush emboldened  disenfranchised social forces to voice their demands. Chartism proved  agile in articulating the material grievances that plagued many Victorians.  It clarified political contention and offered a framework with which to seek  change. It was rapidly emulated, facilitated widespread learning, reshaped  expectations, made an opposition conceivable, and recast nascent desires  as coherent political aims. Even as elites refused to supply all the demands  that were petitioned of them, by ceding elements of their political power,  they opened up channels that allowed political contestation to thunder in  avenues previously closed.  
Not all were welcome to participate in this democratic exchange. Chinese  immigrants and Indigenous Australians found these same channels of  democratic contention closed. It is clear that the gold rush (like the  squattocracy) ignited rapid civil conflict as the Aboriginal population of  Victoria were displaced, often violently, on a mass scale. The settlers’  comparative advantage in violence ensured that this civil conflict was one 
sided, and within the decade, starved of any possibility of retaliation. In  this regard, Victoria indisputably experienced a political resource curse.  This case study demonstrates that ideational causal mechanisms have a  role to play in advancing democratic institutions during a resource boom.  This hypothesis demands of a situation a varied and particular set of  circumstances. As has been well established in the political resource curse  literature, the institutions preceding contention are key: they must allow  for channels with which political contention can flood, so competition may  thrive. However, the theoretical implications of this observation call for a  closer study of the interplay of ideas upon a political resource curse. When  a constituency has both the ability and the interest to demand better  institutions, the right ideas may equip them with a cohesive framework to  advance their political contention, helping to restrain the institutional  deterioration that can be born from a resource boom.
