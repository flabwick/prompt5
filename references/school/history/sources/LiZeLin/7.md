Chapter 7  
The First Fluctuation in Imports  
Introduction  
This chapter examines the relationship between the demand for and the supply of  imports during the period of the first fluctuation of imports (1852-54). A number of  different aspects of this topic should be taken into account. Firstly, this fluctuation  consisted of an abrupt increase and a remarkable decline in imports. The abrupt increase  or boom in imports, which was the most notable feature of this fluctuation, should be  examined carefully. Secondly, changes in the real income of most of the population need  to be established with care in order to assess the extent to which the boom in imports  matched demand. Thirdly, the fluctuation in imports resulted in changes in commercial  situation. Finally, the fluctuation in imports was a part of a the whole process of  enormous change in the economy that followed the gold discoveries in Australia. The  analysis should therefore deal with the process of the fluctuation on the supply side, the  purchasing situation of the majority of the population on the demand side, the effects of  the fluctuation on the commercial situation, the relation of the fluctuation to the  econom y, and the causes of the boom in imports.  
Accordingly, these matters are arranged logically into sections in this chapter. The  purpose of the first section is to describe the development of the first fluctuation in  imports, particular during the boom period. The next section attempts to estimate the  extent to which imports were over-supplied in comparison with the real income of the  working population. The third section analyses the effects of the fluctuation of imports,  and the boom in particular, on the commercial situation. The fourth section discusses the  co-existence of the boom in imports and the surges or stagnation in other sectors of the  economy. The last section is an analysis of the causes of the over-supply of imports in  this period. The arguments of this chapter build on the work of the previous chapter and  also incorporate a good deal of qualitative comments drawn largely from a systematic  search of the regular market reports in the Argus.

The development of the first boom in imports  
The root causes of the boom in imports and of other significant changes in the  economy were the gold discoveries and the rapidity with which gold was extracted from  the ground. Though gold was first discovered in Victoria in 1845, no official  recognition was given to any find until Campbell's at Clunes in March 1850.  Widespread public recognition of the opportunities for individuals to participate in  alluvial gold mining, moreover, was delayed until mid-1851. Payable gold was so  abundant, however, that many discoveries were made within a short period of time once  the search began in earnest. In a period of only three month to September 1851 rich  finds were made at Anderson's Creek, Castlemaine, Ballarat, Daylesford, and  Creswick. 1 High levels of production were evident by the November of that year. Gold  mining leapt to first place in the colony's output, and the gold exported from Melbourne  in December 1851 was equal to 47 per cent of the total value of exports in 1850, or 59  per cent of the export value of wool from the colony for the whole year 1850.  
Higher incomes - not limited to diggers  
The first link in the chain of factors leading to the boom in imports was the  spreading of the news of fortunes being made in digging for gold. There was a universal  increase in the money incomes of various occupations. As the news of discoveries of  rich payable gold and relatively easy fortunes in Victoria spread in the last months of  1851, large numbers of people in the colony and the sister colonies rushed to the  goldfields. (A few months earlier there had been rushes to Lewis Ponds and Summerhill  Creek in New South Wales) The alluvial gold was so abundant that many of the people  who rushed to the goldfields in the early days of the discoveries made their fortune. One  feature of gold mining in the early 1850s was that production increased very swiftly.  When the rush started in November 1851, about 13,663 were estimated to be working  on the goldfields, and the registered amount of gold that was exported from Melbourne  was 34,410 ounces, making an average of 2.5 ounces per digger. One month later,  however, the gold exported from Melbourne rose to 6.9 ounces per adult male digger,

and this level was maintained through January and February 1852.2 If undeclared gold  exports from the Victorian ports other than Melbourne are taken into account., at least an  additional return of 20-30 per cent should be added to this estimated average gold  return. Then the average digger's return would be over £20 a month from December  1851 to February 1852 when diggers were glad to part with their gold dust at the rate of  50 shillings an ounce in the goldfields. In contrast, blacksmiths, carpenters, and bullock  drivers could then earn £5-7 a month and this was the highest rate of wages among the  working population in the period of December 1851 and the first few months of 1852.3  High returns in gold digging were thus a powerful magnet pulling workers away from  their normal occupations. These developments affected the labour market in two ways: a  labour shortage developed and wages rose. Victoria itself was the first colony affected  by labour shortages. There are many descriptions in historical studies of workers  quitting their jobs to go to the goldfields.4 For example, a report in early 1852 had this  to say: 'one of the chief grievances is the manner of enforcing all persons ...  storekeepers, butchers, bakers, and other non-diggers to take out a license, not to carry  on their respective trades, but to dig for gold so that a person is made a gold digger in  spite of himself.5 The high income could not be confined to diggers only for long in a  society in which anyone was free to take to the diggings. Wage rates were thus pulled  up almost immediately in varying degrees as employers sought to retain workers.  Appendix 6-2 reveals that no later than December 1851, the labour market had been  seriously affected. Wage rates of married couples (employed on farms or property),  stock-keepers, ploughmen, shepherds, bullock drivers, cooks, blacksmiths and  carpenters (but not of housemaids) started to increase. Between December 1851 and  April 1852 the wage rates for most of these occupations increased by 20 to 50 per cent.  In the twelve months to the middle of 1853 wages in most occupations increased by a  further 30 to 50 per cent and in some cases this increase went up to 100 per cent. The

rise in wage rates which continued till the end of 1854 proved to be a powerful stimulus  to immigration.  
Increase in population and consumption  
The prospect of a better life and a higher income was the principal consideration  for migrants from Europe to the new world in the nineteenth century. This was  particularly so with the rush to the goldfields of California in the late 1840s and  Australia in early 1850s. Though many of the gold seekers came to Victoria in the early  days of the gold discoveries with dreams of fortunes to be made in gold itself, the  general increase in wage rates in Victorian also attracted immigrants. Higher earnings  were counteracted largely by the higher prices, but this does not seem to have deterred  the fortune seekers. Large numbers of immigrant began to arrive as soon as was  practicable when news of the rich discoveries spread. The immigration returns show that  within the eight months from October 1851 to June 1852, before there had been time for  overseas immigrants to come in response to the gold discoveries, 34,452 unassisted  immigrants arrived by sea in Melbourne. All but 2,831 of these migrants came from  other Australian colonies. The number of adult males among these immigrants by sea  exceeded those in Victoria before gold and equalled one fifth of adult males in all the  Australian colonies.6 By July 1852, the total population of the colony had reached  111,890.7  
The demand for imports was growing faster than supply in the period to July  1852 even though the increase in immigrants coming from the other Australian colonies  went together with an increase in goods supplied from the same sources. By the end of  1851 the total population stood at 88,275 and the current value of imports amounted to  £1,422,909.8 The value of imports per head was thus £16; this has reached £20 by June  1852. In real terms, however, this figure suggests that by June 1852 the supply of

7 This figure included 77,345 by the census taken on 2nd March 1851 and 10,930 and 23,615 through  net migration in the remaining months of 1851 and first seven months in 1852 respectively.

321  
goods per person was now lower than at the time when gold was discovered. By June  1852 some prices were already increasing in Melbourne, particularly of building  materials. Prices on the goldfields had risen spectacularly. Also, the import figures  include £394,392 in specie (representing 9.7 per cent of total imports for 1852), and this  could not be used for personal consumption.9 Nevertheless, the rise in the real income  of the working population had raised their capacity to consume. Demand continued to  grow faster than supply, and the imbalance became greater from the middle of 1852.  Contemporary commercial intelligence provided a great many reports describing this  situation. One, for example, went as follows: 'the importations from the adjacent  colonies in the past week, have been fully equal to the preceding, but arrivals from  England are anxiously looked for, as some ships are overdue, and stocks of many  consumable articles are nearly exhausted' .10 A month later another report stated: 'our  market remains in nearly as bare a state as last week. The few arrivals we have had from  England not being of sufficient importance to affect them. Large importations are  absolutely necessary. Nearly all consumptions are in great demand, and have an upward  tendency. '1 1  
The arrival of immigrants from overseas, and from Britain in particular, further  
upset the balance of demand and supply. The first British immigrants to come directly in  response to news of the gold discoveries arrived in Victoria in July 1852, and thereafter  immigrants from Britain and other overseas countries were still dominant in Victoria and  in other Australian colonies. In October 1852 immigrants from Britain and other foreign  ports reached 11,095, exceeding the 5,434 from internal Australian migration for the  first time since the gold discoveries. 12 Then the enormous tide of immigrants from  overseas coincided with the intercolonial movements. This huge tide of immigrants from  inside and outside Australia began in August 1852 and lasted till October 1853. The net  population gain by immigration was 90,502 in this period. The total population of  Victoria was by that time nearly three times the size it had been before the gold

322  
discoveries.13 The first overseas immigrants, unlike the early intercolonial arrivals, did  not come with corresponding amount of goods, and this aggravated the supply  deficiency. It seemed that ships from overseas were too busy bringing in migrants to  allow room for cargoes. Moreover, when the summer of 1852 approached, the  favourable weather and a large number of applications for cartage to the diggings gave  an impetus to trade by causing an extra demand. In the interval before large-scale  imports from overseas arrived, the lag in supply existed indeed and brought windfall  gains to merchants holding stocks of goods.  
Considerations of commercial profitability  
In examining the question of commercial profitability and the role of commercial  
profit expectations as an explanation for the surge in the supply of imports, I am  hampered by a lack of direct infonnation about suppliers' mark-ups and profit margins.  All I have to go on is the behaviour of prices. Melbourne wholesale prices are the only  available series representing Victorian prices. These included the cost of, for example,  delivery and transport, in addition to the basic invoice cost. Many traders were involved  in these transactions, and it is not clear how the difference between the wholesale and  invoice prices was divided among them. It can be assumed that the organizers or  suppliers made profits which were proportional to prices, so that increases in prices  might be taken in the first instance as an indication that profits from commerce were  rising.  
The growth in demand made it possible to sell large amounts of goods at high  
prices. The price of merchandise in Victoria started to increase at the end of 1851 and  early in the 1852. At this time, however, the price of most goods did not increase as  much as immigration from other Australian colonies or as much as wages. The lagged  increase of prices was probably due to the existence of stocks which could be drawn  upon to meet the initial increase in consumption. The substantial increase in prices did

323  
not come until July and August 1852. This was a time when demand was greatly  enlarged due to the arrival of overseas immigrants, particularly from Britain. When  intercolonial migration increased there had also been a roughly proportionate increase in  goods supply. But when large number of overseas immigrants came, there was no  substantial increase in goods supply from the same source as the migrants. This led to  demand largely exceeding supply and so to price increases, particularly for such items as  brandy, rum, ale, tea, timber, and iron. At this stage, speculation did not appear to have  been important, though it was to become so one year later. The increase in prices is  adequately explained by the enormous increase in demand for goods for current use  from the last months of 1852. The demand was so great that it was not dampened even  by high prices. For example, it was reported that when the cargo of the Revenue arrived  in Melbourne in late October from New York, 'the bidding was lively, and rates given  which we should consider encouraging to shippers from that port, and likely to lead to  further shipments to this market' .14 The arrival of overseas immigrants in large number  thus brought an increase to the general level of prices, and the continued inflow of  immigrants contributed much to the maintenance of the high level of prices and also to  even further price increase. The extraordinary increase in consumption associated with  immigration made it possible for large quantities of goods to be sold at high prices.  
The rising tide of supply was thus disposed of at high prices at this time. Figure  7-1 shows that supply of imports was at its highest from the second quarter of 1853 to  the first quarter of 1854. The price level of five or six month earlier, that is from the end  of 1852 to the end of 1853, was significant in explaining the increased supply of goods.  The substantial increase in prices from August-September 1852 is evident in Figure 7-1.  This price increase suggested the prospect of considerable commercial profitability  which, together with the rapid enlargement of the market due to the growing population,  led to the commencement of the surge of imports. Figure 7-1 also shows that the high  level of the prices was maintained until September-October 1853. The continuing high  prices became a factor behind suppliers' active behaviour in importing large quantities of

goods, and this lasted long enough to create a remarkable tide of incoming goods. Prices  peaked about six months before the peak in supply. This was roughly the time it took  for ships to Britain and America to make the return voyage (a sample study of the time  of voyage will be explained in the last section of this chapter). The existence of the gap  is apparent in Figure 7-1 at the time when the tide started, when it ended, and when it  reached a trough around the middle of 1855.

In considering the relationship between prices in Victoria and elsewhere, Figure  7-2 shows that most overseas imports came from Britain, and this indicates that  difference in prices between Britain and Victoria were thus an important source of  commercial profits. Figure 7-3 shows that the value of merchandise in the Victorian  market was 200-300 per cent of the prices in Britain in the period from the last months  of 1852 to the end of 1853. A contemporary comment in June 1852 supported this  estimation. It said 'keeping out provisions, we are told that the present colonial value of  goods is 150 per cent advance upon English prices; and, even with provisions,  thaverage advance is estimated at 100 per cent' .15 The fluctuation of prices in New  South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania was not as severe as Victoria. The  difference in prices between the colonies was always a factor attracting goods from the  sister colonies though it is not investigated in this thesis. So, it is believed that the  prospect of profiting from price differences in different markets formed the basis on  which large quantities of goods were moved from market to market. The higher the  prices were in the Victorian market, the stronger the attraction would be for shippers,  
merchants, and anybody else who participated in bringing goods to Victoria.  15 Argus, 3 June 1852, p. 4. 
326  
Influx of goods - development of the surplus  
The arrival of imports in extraordinary quantities eventually changed the balance  of demand and supply. The size and suddenness of the rise in the tide of imports is  shown in the fact that in the second quarter of 1853, when the tide started, the current  value of imports to Melbourne was 300, 255 and 275 per cent of the values in the third  and fourth quarters of 1852 and first quarter of 1853 respectively. In terms of average  value of imports per immigrant in the same periods, Figure 7-4 shows that the average  value per immigrant was £27, £37, £59, £45 and £59 for the four quarters of 1852 and  the first quarter of 1853. From the second quarter of 1853 to the first quarter of 1854,  however, the average value was between £160 and £253. Figure 7-5 throws light on the  changing state of demand and supply. If it is assumed that the balance of demand and  supply was basically maintained before the middle of 1852, as is consistent with  contemporary descriptions, and that demand apparently exceeded supply in the latter half  of 1852, then supply was growing much faster than demand during the period of the  boom of imports (from the second quarter of 1853 to the first quarter of 1854). This, of  course, is only one of the quantitative measurements. The new estimates of imports per  head in Victoria in Chapter 2 has also shown the surge in imports. It is also clear that the  increase in supply of imports largely exceeded the growth in demand in the  contemporary reports of the commercial situation as will be described below.  
According to contemporary reports of the changing state of the market, the market  went through three stages at the time of the boom in imports, each stage reflecting a  different relationship between the supply of and demand for imports. The first stage was  one of a gradual shift towards a situation of over-supply of goods. It covered roughly  the period from June 1853 to the end of that year. At this time there was no sudden glut  of imported goods on the market, possibly because supplies had earlier been less than  demand. So, early in May 1853 it was reported that 'notwithstanding recent arrivals, the  demand for goods of every kind has suffered no diminution, and inquiries are rather on  the increase than otherwise for the consignment most in demand'.16 One month later,  
16 Argus. 12 May 1853. p. 4. 
327  
however, in June 1853, supply equalled demand. The price mechanism would play its  role in adjusting supply to demand. This situation was described thus: 'there is a  growing conviction in commercial circles that prices must fall, and under that feeling  merchants are anxious to quit stocks, even at lower figures than our quotation justify.'17  With the gradual accumulation of merchandise, a surplus was fmally achieved no later  than November 1853. In the last one or two months of 1853, it was reported that 'some  of the retailers still complain of dullness, as compared with last year. Many storekeepers  have visited town, but have given orders only for temporary supplies'.lS Moreover,  shipments having come into the colony 'from almost every country in the world', the  Melbourne market was said to be 'largely overstocked'.19 Many people in commercial  circles were on the alert for any sign of over-supply. Since around July-August 1853 the  infonnation and warnings about the glut of merchandise in the Victorian market had  'been forwarded to all parts of the world'.2o However, it was only towards the end of  1853 that the merchants of Victoria started to realize the serious extent of the glut. Thus  it was reported: 'we are told that the statements of imports recently published in the  Argus have both surprised and startled the merchants, who had no idea that such  enormous quantities of goods had been received'.21 Around October news of a  developing glut of goods in Victoria had reached Britain and other foreign ports, and the  arrival of the Harbing er in Melbourne in late December 1853 brought the news of a  partial suspension of shipments from Britain to Australia.22 This was probably the  earliest report of slow-down in imports was reported. But it appeared to be too late. By  October 1853 large quantities of imports had been arranged and much of this had already  been shipped, further increasing supply in the first quarter of 1854.

The second stage runs from the end of 1853 to October 1854, during which the  continuing over-supply led to the growth of a large surplus in the market and brought  about losses or reduced merchants' profits to merchants. This stage coincided with a  period of commercial recession that will be further discussed in the third section. Early 
329  
in 1854, or no later than March 1854, it became difficult for merchants to reap profits  from the sale of most articles. A contemporary report described this situation: 'the  consequence has been that, in spite of a consumption altogether unprecedented by any  community, most goods introduced have been unsalable at a profit'.23 Inventories  continued to rise in the remaining months of 1854. In September, the market was  severely glutted, as it was reported: 'at auctions and otherwise goods are sold at rates  that would amaze consignors, and this in order to realize store-rent, insurance, and  commission ... a great deal of mischief has been done by commission merchants and  others, who, from ignorance of the market, want of judgement, or other causes, have  made grievous and unnecessary sacrifices'.24 Nevertheless, the sacrifices and losses  were not universal; the number of those making losses was not very big. As was  reported at that time: 'there are, of course, numerous and honourable exceptions, that is,  firms who will hold until they feel satisfied that it is in the interest of their  correspondents that they should sell; and merchants at home will find it their interest to  be careful in selecting their consignees'.25 The contemporary evidence above has  suggested that the boom, with imports greatly exceeding demand, had caused a lack of  activity inactivity of purchase in the market on the part of buyers. Imports continued to  pour in and the surplus was greatly aggravated. Commercial profitability was  considerably reduced. The prices of some articles declined noticeably.  
The continuing accumulation of imports and the severely aggravated market  situation caused a decline in the supply of imports. In comparison with the first quarter  of 1854, the quarterly impOits into Melbourne decreased by 39 per cent, 27 per cent and  46 per cent in the remaining quarters of that year respectively. (for actual figures see  Appendix 6-4 (1 ». This was the bust following the boom in imports.  
Nonetheless, before the state of over-supply of imports had been reduced to any  significant extent, the market situation worsened. There were two features of this stage.  One was the widespread bankruptcy of commercial businesses. The process was

330  
described as follows: 'at first, when the glut caused a great depreciation in value, many  speculators and retail traders purchased large quantities of goods to hold for a rise; but  the continued arrivals have caused a further depreciation, and a large number of traders  have suffered heavy losses'. To this state of affairs 'is to be attributed many  insolvencies. Again, the universal system of forced sale, and great sacrifices at auction,  have very seriously injured legitimate business, both wholesale and retail, disappointed  fair expectations, and caused a ruinous depreciation of stocks; so that many houses of  previous good standing and excellent prospects have been unable to meet their  engagements. '26 The appearance of the depression was so sudden that most  insolvencies occurred in just the last few months of 1854.27 Another feature was the  sharp decline of 20-30 per cent in prices during the same period (for details see  Appendix 7-1). October-November 1854 appears to mark the turning point in the  commercial situation. The over-supply of imports, however, was not the only cause of  this change. The nature of the down-turn in the commercial situation and those factors  other than the import situation will be discussed in the third section.  
The discussion above has confirmed that there indeed existed a fluctuation of  imports with a boom and succeeding bust. Moreover, the discussion has also suggested  that, together with this tluctuation of imports, there were changes in the commercial  situation and that the import situation should also be related to a particular state of the  economy. The distinctive features of the commercial situation and how these were  related to the fluctuations in imports, as well as role of the fluctuations in the economy,  will be examined in third section of this chapter.  
The most important point made in this section is that the supply of imports greatly  exceeded the demand. The extent to which demand was exceeded by supply has not  been assessed so far in quantitative telms. This is the topic of the following section.  
26 Argus, 23 November 1854, p. 4.  
27 In the first six montlls of 1854 the total insolvent liabilities of traders was only about £266,000;  from 1 July to 18 November this rose to about £520,000; from then till the end of the year the total  liabilities was probably no less Ulan £1,200,000 because it was estimated that 'the total liabilities of  insolvents during 1854 could not be much under £2,000,000 sterling'. Argus, 27 January 1855, p. 4. 
331  
Estimates of the purchasing power of the working population  
An assessment of the extent to which the supply of imports exceeded demand,  first of all, needs a measurement of net increase in imports per head of population.  Chapter 2 has pointed out that, with 1850=100, the net increase in imports per head in  constant value was 210 in 1853 and 190 in 1854. However, while the income of nearly  all the occupations increased after the gold discoveries, there was an enormous inflation  of prices in Melbourne and the prices in the interior were even higher.

The question of the over-supply of imports has been alluded to by many writers.  Their comments have provided only a general description of the situation and have often  involved a simple compalison made in current values. 28 The best recent study is that of  Maddock and McLean in 'Supply-side shocks: the case of Australian gold'. When they  
28 The question of over-supply of imports during this period has been widely noted. For example,  McCombie pointed out that 'about 1852, supplies poured into the colony from all quarters of the world,  and the merchandise increased so mu ch in amount that, in Jul y, 1853, a glut appeared inevitable'  (History of the Colony of Victoria, p. 240). When he analysed the causes of the commercial depression  in 1854, Dunolly thought that 'the first facLOr in this depression was the excessive influx of imports  during 1853' ('Effects of Gold Rushes in the 1850s', p. 98). Serle corrunented that 'in 1853 over £7  million worth of goods were exported to Victoria from Britain and nearly £6 million worth in 1854 - and  almost as much from other countries ... the grea t majority dabbling in the import Irade had lost their  capital. And still sufficient goods poured in to satisfy two or three times the population.' (The Golden  Age, p. 121). The case of measuring the state of over-supply of imports in current value can be found,  for example, in Dunoll y. of Gold Ru hes in the 1850s', pp. 99-100.

tried to show the process of economic adjustment under the impact of the gold  discoveries, they compiled a composite wage index and a price index of basic  commodities. These two indexes have reflected some relationships between prices and  wage rates in Victoria in the l850s. The results of the comparison, as shown in Figure  7-6, indicate that the increase in wages was much greater than the increase in prices in  1852 and 1853. From 1854 this relationship was reversed. However, there are two  problems with the data they used. One is that their price index is narrowly based. In the  period to 1854 only four commodities (bread, flour, buner and potatoes) are included in  the index, and the prices of another four articles refer to New South Wales. On average,  these items comprised not more than 20 per cent of the total value of the imported goods  exclusive of specie. Another is that their wage index makes no distinction between  geographic areas, though it can be established that workers faced very different  conditions in different parts of the colony. These two indexes, therefore, do not show  the extent to which purchasing power in Victoria matched the surges in imports.  
A proper assessment can be made in two steps. The first step is an examination  of wages and income of various occupations in the coastal area and in the interior,  because income and consumption was different in these two areas. The examination of  the purchasing power of workers in specific occupations can show in detail the  relationship between prices and income in reference to different parts of the working  population. For this purpose, a number of separate indexes of wages and one combined  price index of wholesale plices in Melbourne have been established. For the interior, the  average returns of miners are estimated as representing the income of general labourers  on the goldfields. The second step is a summary of the examination of the extent to  which the supply of impoI1s matched demand. For this purpose, a price index for the  interior and estimates of annual income of workers in three typical occupations  representative of the working population in the colony as a whole have been established.  
The first step starts in the coastal area. The wages of carpenters (taken to be  representative of all skilled workers, for reasons that will be given later), married  couples, female servants, falm bullock-drivers, stock-keepers, and shepherds have been  selected for examination. The combined price index is based on fifteen items

Carpenters' wage rates have been chosen as representative of the annual wages of  
all kinds of skilled workers. The labour market column in the Argus and the  Commissioners' Reports both provided solid evidence for the similarity of the wage  rates among skilled artisans such as carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, wheelwrights,  and bricklayers. The purchasing power of various skilled workers appears to have 


336  
remained at the same level throughout the period from September-October 1853 to  August-September 1855. The margin between wages and prices suggests that this part  of the population had the capacity to consume about one-third more than they would  have before the gold discoveries. Figure 7-13 shows that imports per head in constant  values (as shown in Table 2-4 in Chapter 2) during the boom were about double the  level of 1850. This suggests that even workers with the highest wage rates could not  have consumed as much as supplied that in 1853 and 1854.

Notes and sources: For gross imports per bead in current value see Victoria, Statistical Registers,  1845-1865; net imports per bead in constant value is the result of dividing net  imports in constant value (see Appendices 2-1 and 2-3) by population.  
The consumption situation of other workers was much worse than that of skilled  artisans. The wages of workers in some occupations such as shepherds and female  servants even lagged behind the increase in prices during the surge in imports. Workers  in occupations such as married couple and stock-keepers appear to have been better off,  but the real wages of people in these occupations were hardly 30 per cent higher than in  the period before gold. The farm bullock-driver's earnings appear to have doubled. No  more than 2 per cent of the population was employed in this occupation and they had to  buy goods at the high prices prevailing in the interior and the nature of their seasonal 
337  
work largely reduced their real gainS}1 The prices in the interior and the seasonal nature  of the work of bullock-drivers have been discussed in Part Two.  
Therefore, it can be concluded that the increase of real wages in the coastal areas  (not more than 20-30 per cent) could not absorb the doubling of the supply of imports.  
In the interior, miners' incomes have been chosen to indicate the income of all  general labourers because miners represented the largest occupational group of  occupations in the colony and the majority of the labour force in the interior. Efforts to  estimate the annual return to gold diggers have been made by historians, such as  Coghlan, Smyth, Serle, Maddock and McLean. Serle made his estimates by dividing  Coghlan's estimates of gold production by the number of adult males as estimated by the  Goldfields' Commissioners and Wardens.32 Smyth's estimates should not be relied on  because he underestimated gold production, as has been explained in the previous  chapter. Maddock and McLean do not give details of the gold and population data they  used, but their estimates are quite close to Serle's.33 A series of the average gold returns  is established here which adopts Registrar-General Archer's estimation of gold exports  and divides this by the average number of adult males on the goldfields.34 The results  suggest that Serle's estimates might be too high for 1852 and too low for 1856, due to  possible problems with Coghlan's estimates, as has been discussed in the previous  chapter. In the new estimates allowance should be made for the lower estimates for 1852  due to undeclared and hoarded gold. For the present purpose, the estimates are treated  neither as the average income of individual diggers nor as the average return to diggers  as a whole. Rather, they are treated as the level of the income of adult male labourers in  the interior as a whole, and on the goldfields in particular. These estimates are as  follows: 1852, £317; 1853, £232; 1854, £133; 1855, £145; 1856, £121; 1857, £117;  1858, £69; 1859, £66 and 1860, £79.

34 The monthly figures of adult males for the period July 1854-December 1857 are directly derived from  the Goldfields' Commissioners' Reports; the remaining figures are taken from Serle, The Golden Age,  pp. 388-9. 
338  
The income position of the working population can be further assessed through a  comparison of the average return of labourers on the goldfields with the wage rates of  other types of labourers. Carpenters and labourers on the roads have been chosen as  representing skilled workers and other occupations. The daily wage rates of carpenters  are available from 3 May 1852. For the first four months of 1852 the daily rates are  fixed as 80 per cent of those from May to August of the same year by analogy with the  increase in the wages of those occupations with rations. For the remainder of the series  average wage rates are calculated at six days a week by monthly weights. The actual  wages for skilled workers are estimated as follows: 1852, £190; 1853, £359; 1854,  £401; 1855, £213; 1856, £204; 1857, £210; 1858, £200; 1859, £179; and 1860, £179.  Labouring on the roads was an occupation that appeared with the large improvements to  land communications in 1853. These workers were paid at daily rates with wood, water,  and tent accommodation. Workers of this type in Melbourne could earn similar wages.  Evidence is available showing that town labourers could earn as much as the labourers  on the road (as reported in the Argus, 4 May 1855, p. 4). The estimation is made on the  basis of average monthly rates for a six-day week throughout the period and the results  are as follows: 1853, £156; 1854, £184; 1855, £132; 1856, £148; 1857, £127; 1858,  £109; 1859, £120; and 1860, £115.

The relationship of the three series of estimated annual incomes is presented in  Figure 7-14. This figure suggests that 1852 was a good time for labourers, particularly  for those on the goldfields. Their average returns were much higher than all those wage earners in Melbourne and other coastal areas. The high incomes of this part of the  population proved to be a stimulating factor in the enonnous increase in population that  has been discussed earlier. The population increase in turn resulted in two great  changes. One was the increase in the labour force on the goldfields and the decline in  average incomes. Another was the adjustment of the wage rates due to increasing  demand for various services and the compression of wage relativities. In these  circumstances the wage rates of various skilled workers or artisans rose to be higher  than those of male labourers on the goldfields in 1853. In 1854 the growing population  and labour force, together with the stagnation in gold output, brought about a decline in  the earnings of labourers on the goldfields. Their average annual income was not only  far behind that of skilled workers, but also lower than that of workers in such  occupations as ordinary labourers, fann bullock-drivers, and cooks in Melbourne (as  shown in Appendix 6-2). In the two years 1856 and 1857 the estimated annual earnings  of labourers on the goldfields were lower than those of labourers in Melbourne. In the  years after 1858 the gap in earnings appeared again, though consideration should be  given to the increasing unemployment in Melbourne and other coastal towns at this time.  The purchasing power of the population in the interior, particularly on the goldfields,  was superior to that of the population of the coastal areas in the last few months of 1851  and the whole of 1852. This advantage was being eroded by 1853 and had gone in  1854. The stories that are told by many historians of diggers lighting cigars with bank  notes, if true at all, applied to the few diggers who made fortunes in the early stages of  the gold rushes. 35 The high prices in the interior meant that the people there faced  greater difficulties in buying the goods they needed than did people in the coastal areas,  as has been discussed in Part Two.

Notes and sources: The annual price indexes of Melbourne and Bendigo (1853-59) are calculated from  monthly prices which are listed in Appendix 7-1(1-4) and Appendix 5-2 (1-2). The  prices of 11 articles are used in compiling the price index for Bendigo. These  articles are flour, butter, cheese, tea, coffee, candles, saIt., sugar, timber, spirit and  wine. The missing price data for salt., sugar, timber, spirit and wine for varying  length are filled up by the rates of decline in price of flour which was among the  goods of necessities. The price index for Bendigo in 1852 is a guess work according  to index in 1853 and relevant descriptions in the literature, as has been dealt with in  Chapter 5.  
For the second step of the assessment, a summary table (Table 7-2) has been  prepared with a aim showing the extent to which the purchasing power of the working  population of Victoria matched the two surges in imports in the 1850s. Before the  implications of Table 7-2 are discussed, two points should be made.First, three types of  workers have been chosen to represent all types of workers in the colony. The working  population consisted of three main categories of workers: skilled workers; general  labourers including domestic servants, ploughmen, shepherds, stock-keepers, and etc;  and labourers on the goldfields. So carpenters, labourers on road labourers on the  goldfields have been chosen to represent the three categories. 36 Secondly, the price  index for the interior is based simply on the prices of eleven articles sold in Bendigo.  Most of these articles were basic foods. It is also assumed that the prices of other  
36 It is assumed that carpenters and labourers on the road represented 10 % and 40 % of the work force in  the coastal area, and labourers on the goldfields represented the remaining 50 % of the work force in the  interior. These assumptions are made on the basis of the fact that in 1854 skilled workers were 13 % of 
341  
necessities of life, such as clothes and footwear, would have been no lower than those  of the basic foods. The cost of accommodation and meat are not taken into consideration  in this index.37 Other explanations will be given in the notes to the table.

the adult male labour force, and 53 % of the population was located in the interior where labourers on  the goldfields were the principal labour force. Victoria, Census, 1854.  
37 It can be assumed that the cost of accommodation and meat would be higher in Melbourne than in the  interior. This category of expenditure indeed formed about half the total living costs of a typical artisan's  family in 1854 (Two statements published by the Melbourne Labour Committee suggested that for an  artisan's family of five, the cost of rent and meat formed 57% and 49% of a week's total living costs in  May and November 1854 respectively. Coghlan, Labour and Industry in Australia, p. 810.) Rent was  certainly a factor when comparing living costs in Melbourne with the tents and huts on the goldfields.  However, in 1852-3 canvas towns existed in Melbourne, and a significant number of people living there  paid only a maintenance fee to the governmenL Also, a substantial part of the working class lived in  Simple huts or in one room in a cottage, and in this case the share of rent should be lower than the about  40 % that was estimated by Coghlan for two rooms for an artisan's family. Expenditure for meat was  about 20 % of such a family's living costs. I have compared the prices of beef and mullon in the Argus  and in the Gold Commissioners' Reports. Prices appear to have been much the same in the two sources  in many months of 1853 and 1854. For instance, in October 1853 the price of beef and mutton was 7d  per lb in Melbourne, whereas the prices were 7d in Castlemaine, 6.5d in Sandburst (Bendigo), 8d in  Ballarat, 8d in Heathcote, and 5.5d in Beechworth.

342  
An analysis of Table 7-2 stresses the periods 1853-4 and 1856-7 which cover the  two fluctuations in imports, particularly two surges in imports into Victoria. First of all,  it can be found that, taking net imports per head as 100 in 1850, representing the period  before the gold discoveries, the average quantity of imports increased to 210 in 1853  and 190 in 1854. This suggests that the average quantity of imports per head during the  period of the first surge of imports was double that in 1850. Then, it can be seen that  there was enormous inflation of prices in both the coastal area and in the interior. This  inflation greatly affected the purchasing power of the working population. Finally, on  the assumption that the pattern of consumption of imports have the same relationship to  real income as in 1850, the figures in Table 7-2 suggest that the supply of imports in  1853 and 1854 exceeded the demand for imports of skilled workers, general labourers  and labourers on the goldfields by about 40 per cent, 80 per cent and 380 per cent  respectively. It can also be seen that during the first surge in imports, the average returns  of adult male labourers on the goldfields, which had been the initial stimulus for the  increase in population and goods supply, were declining. Therefore, the people in the  interior were a weaker source of consumption demand than that many contemporaries  assumed when they entered into arrangements to supply the colony with imports.  
The discussion in this section has suggested the extent to which the supply of  imports exceeded demand during the period of the first boom in imports. The question  of why imports were over-supplied will be discussed later in the chapter. However, the  first section has also shown that the whole process of the fluctuation in imports  coincided with the changing situation of commerce. This suggests that the import  situation greatly affected the general commercial situation. Nonetheless, the import  situation does not directly represent the commercial situation. The relationship between  the two is confusing in the literature, as discussed in the first section of Chapter 6. This  suggests that a further enquiry into how the import situation was connected with the  changing commercial situation needs to be made. 
343  
The fluctuation in imports and the commercial situation  
According to current trade-cycle theory, the trade cycle mean fluctuations in the  level of economic activities alternating between periods of depression and boom  conditions.38 This cycle is normally characterized by four phases: depression, recovery,  boom and recession. With regard to what causes the economy to fluctuate in this way,  one prominent factor is the volatility of fIxed investment and inventory investment  expenditures. In this thesis the terminologies of these phases are used to describe the  situations in relation to imports, commerce and the economy in general, but they are  identifIed by various features. So far as the commercial situation in the fIrst few years of  the 1850s is concerned, the 'boom', 'recession' and 'depression' phases are  identifIable. This section will examine these phases and will discuss the relationship  between the import situation and commerce during these phases.  
The commercial boom phase  
The 'commercial boom' lasted from early 1852 to the last months of 1853. The  identifIcation of the boom phase is based on four phenomena. They were the greatly  increased demand, the high profItability of transactions in the distribution market  (Melbourne), the maintenance of a basic balance between the supply of and the demand  for imports, and the rapid increase in the number of commercial businesses.  
The rich gold discoveries gave an initial impetus to the greatly increased demand.  There was a connection between the level of gold production and the size of immigration  in the short run. Figure 7-15 shows that two waves of local immigration were  apparently related to the two rises in gold production from early 1852 to early 1853.  From October 1852 immigrants from Britain and other foreign ports largely exceeded  those from within Australia. Demand for goods hence was greatly enlarged. The waves  of immigration had raised the level of prices substantially, as shown in Figure 7-16. The  gap in prices between Victoria and the source countries of imports made for  opportunities for highly profitable transactions (as shown in Figure 7-3) when the  supply of imports did not exceed demand to any great extent. Contemporary reports in  
38 Eatwell, The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, Vol. 4, pp. 666-71. 
344  
theArgus concerning the market situation suggested that during this short period  commercial transaction was active and there was no substantial over-stocking. This was  an indication of the existence of a basic balance between the supply of and the demand  for imports. This basic balance was an important condition for realization of high profits  in commerce. Also in this period, the number of various commercial businesses  increased enormously, as dealt briefly with in Chapter 3.

In terms of the flow of imports, the first boom lasted about one year, from the  second quarter of 1853 to the first quarter of 1854, as discussed in first section. The  boom of imports occurred during the latter part of the commercial boom. When the  accumulation of imports reached a certain level or supply largely exceeded demand, four  features of the 'commercial boom' underwent considerable change. From late 1853  some prices started to decline, as shown in Appendix 6-3, the increase in the number of  businesses slowed down, the market began to appear glutted and to appear and  commercial profitability accordingly declined. So, the 'commercial boom' came to an  end and a period of 'commercial recession' started.

The commercial recession phase  
The 'commercial recession' lasted from the end of 1853 to September-October  1854. The recession had four main features. The amount of imports greatly exceeded  demand, the large volume of imports continued to aggravated the situation of surplus,  commercial transaction were inactive and commercial profitability was remarkably  reduced, and level of prices declined slightly (the prices of some goods declined, but for  most goods prices were stable).  
The continuing entry of large quantities of imports and a significant decline in  gold production resulted in the 'commercial recession'. The supply of imports ran ahead  of demand and a surplus was created by the end of 1853. This situation then worsened.  The large accumulation of imports dominated the reports in the Argus relating to the  commercial situation during this period. At the same time, there was a remarkable  decline in gold production. It declined for the first time in April 1854, when registered  gold exported dropped from 232,022 ounces in the previous month to 116,077 ounces,  representing a fall of 50 per cent. Gold exports fell considerably again from July-August 

346  
1854.39 A sharp decline in the average incomes of labourers on the goldfields occurred  during this period, as shown in Figure 8-5. This inevitably affected the incomes of other  types of labourers and hence the total demand for imports in the colony. In these  circumstances, inactivity of transaction prevailed, and unprofitability or even losses in  commercial dealings were frequently reported, as discussed in the first section.  
The import situation was different from the commercial situation as a whole.  When the first boom in imports was at its mid-point, the situation of commerce already  appeared to be in recession, as summarized above. The peak: in imports in the first  quarter of 1854 further aggravated the commercial recession. During this period some  features of the 'commercial recession' also underwent some change. The most  remarkable was that unprofitable credit transaction and insolvencies became common  and the income of miners on the goldfields declined. This state of affairs meant that  commerce was on the brink of something worse than recession.  
The commercial depression phase  
'Commercial depression' describes the stage following 'commercial recession'.  This phase lasted from October 1854 to early 1855. The depression phase can be  identified in a number of ways. A large number of bankruptcies among commercial  business occurred and prices and wage rates underwent a sharp and overall decline.  These features also suggest a rapid fall in aggregate demand and a low level of output.  
The sharp decline in gold pro.duction at the beginning of this phase was  principally responsible for this commercial situation. Gold production fell by an  unexpected amount in September-October 1854, the export of 82,772 ounces for  October being the lowest monthly level since December 1851 (for details see Appendix  6-1). The sharp decline in gold production, which was due to a severe lack of water  towards the summer of that year, led to a series of sudden changes in the commercial  situation. Credit was further tightened and a large number of traders suffered heavy  losses; widespread bankruptcy appeared and a ruinous depreciation of stocks resulted.  Consequently, monthly price levels in the last two months of 1854 declined by 20 per  
39 For monthly gold exports see Appendix 6-1. 

347  
cent in comparison with average level in the first ten months of that year (for details see  Appendix 7-1). The income of miners on the goldfields declined and this further caused  a general decline in wage rates. Over the period October-December 1854 wage rates for  labourers (other than skilled workers) fell by 20-30 per cent; the wages of skilled  workers fell by 30-40 per cent (for details see Appendix 6-2).  
The supply of imports greatly exceeding demand and this provided the essential  conditions for the change from 'recession' to 'depression'. The surge in imports was the  principal cause of the phase of 'commercial recession'. Although the surge had already  abated well before the situation of commerce turned from 'recession' to 'depression', as  examined in the first section, the sharp contradiction between the amount of supply and  real demand had not been lessened to any significant extent before gold production  declined sharply in September-October. Moreover, during the surge in imports, over 
heated commercial activities resulted in a wide use of credit in commercial transactions.  This state of affairs inevitably caused widespread insolvencies or bankruptcies when  credit was suddenly tightened.  
The fluctuation of imports was not only associated with the changing situation in  commerce, but was also one aspect of the general economic situation. This suggests the  necessity to putting the fluctuation of imports in a broader context in order to look into  its position in the economy. This is the topic of next section.  
The fluctuation of imports and the economy.  
The continuing discoveries of alluvial gold and the high level of production made  gold the leading sector of the economy. It contributed substantially to total output, pulled  population and labour away from the old world and from the other Australian colonies,  and led to appearance of a new economic structure (which underwent further change  when the long-term decline in gold production started in the late 1850s). An outstanding  feature of this new economic structure appeared that the gold discoveries cut the  economy into two parts and affected them differently. One part was based on the gold  industry itself and consisted of the sectors that had to meet the new demand of 
348  
increasing population that was brought about directly by the gold industry and sectors  where investment and speculation were easy. Gold mining, immigration, commerce,  banking, and land sales were tied to this part of the economy. These sectors tended to  overheat and created an phenomenon of 'economic boom'. In addition, government  expenditure significantly contributed to the 'boom'. In contrast, the traditional industries  such as wool growing, agriculture, and some manufacturing were basically stagnant,  though some developed slowly and some declined briefly.  
Imports that considerably affected the situation of commerce was of course  among the over-heated sectors. Imports also contributed to the creation of the 'economic  boom'. However, when the question how closely was the situation of imports related to  the other over-heated sectors is asked, it is necessary to examine the time-span of the  'boom' that each of these sectors experienced so as to judge the position of imports in  the economy. This section deals with the over-heated sectors and stagnant sectors  separately, with exception of gold production because it is dealt with much elsewhere in  . this thesis.  
The over-heated sectors of the economy  
Figure 7-17 shows that the first wave of immigrants, who arrived between early  IS52 and August of that year, came almost wholly from the Australian colonies. This  wave, in spite of its unprecedented level, was far from the peak of immigration, its size  being limited by the size of the population of the Australia colonies. The high tide of  immigration was largely due to the contribution from Britain and other overseas ports,  with British immigrants dominating the total. This tide lasted from September 1852 to  April 1853 and formed the peak of immigration for the whole decade.

Land sales in the early years of settlement of the Australian colonies and  throughout the nineteenth century represented one of the principal sources of  government revenue as well as an important object of private investment. Land sales  were thus a significant indicator of economic conditions. In Victoria, crown land was  first sold in 1837. Up to the end of 1851, the total quantity sold was 263,035 acres,  yielding gross proceeds of £646,999. 40 The enormous increase in wealth and the  apparently unlimited prospects of the colony after the discovery of gold brought the  scale and proceeds of land sales to new levels. In the course of 1852, the area of land  sold was equal to 88 per cent of the area of all land sold previously, and gross proceeds  exceeded the total amount that had been raised since the establishment of the colony.  Figures 7-18 and 7-19 show that in terms of quantity, proceeds, and unit price the high  
tide of land sales ran from latter half of 1852 to the first half of 1854. The statistics on  which Figures 7-18 and 7-19 are based show that in the latter half of 1853 the average  unit price for various types of land reached the highest point. For example, the highest  recorded price per acre in Melbourne reached a peak of £16,800 in latter part of 1853.41  
The average price for town land decreased from £427 per acre in latter part of 1853 to

£220 in the first half of 1854. Land sales underwent a substantial decline in the latter  part of 1854 when the quantity of land sold declined from 213,270 acres to 142,670; the  proceeds from land sales decreased from £810,788 to £513,346. This evidence suggests  that the peak of land sales in the decade covered the period from the latter half of 1852 to  the latter half of 1853.  
At the time of the gold discoveries there were three banks operating in the colony.  They were the Australasia, the Union of Australia, and the Bank of New South Wales.  The levels of all types of service were very low. Banking capital and service entered a  stage of enormous development with the discovery of gold. Figures 7-20 and 7-21  show that the substantial increase in items of assets and capital, deposits, and debts  occurred in the latter half of 1852. This increase was maintained till late 1854 and early  1855, when it declined remarkably. In terms of indications of the boom two things  might be noticed. The first relates to deposits, which may have moved in line with the  purchasing power of individuals and of society as a whole. These started to increase  around the middle of 1852, and the high level was maintained till the last months of  1854. The second is the amount of credit which indicates the level of the credit for  commercial and other industrial purposes. All debts due to banks increased largely  around the middle of 1853 and reached a peak around the middle of 1854, before  declining gradually. This basically coincided with the curve of imports. Moreover, the  ratio of assets to paid up capital also moved with credit conditions. The statistical base  for Figures 7-20 and 7-21 reveals that the ratio was only 0.5 before the discovery of  gold. However, it underwent a sudden increase to 2.9 in the latter part of 1852 and  continued to increase throughout 1853. This ratio reached 3.6 in the second quarter of  1854, the peak of the decade, then declined sharply to 1.0 in the last quarter of 1855.  These data, then, reveal that the period of enormous development of banking service  coincided with the tide of imports. 


The above examination indicates that under the effect of the gold discoveries  some sectors of the economy expanded considerably from the latter half of 1852 to the  latter part of 1853. These facts suggest that the effect of gold was wide spread, and not  limited to any particular sector. The situation of imports were connected widely with  these sectors, particularly related to the situation of immigration that represented the  demand situation. The 'commercial boom', as discussed in the previous section, 


353  
appeared immediately after the rich gold discoveries because of the great demand and  high commercial profits. The appearance of the boom of imports was comparatively  slow because the adjustment of supply to demand was not as flexible as other sectors.  This will be further dealt with in the fmal section.  
The stagnant sectors of the economy  
When he analysed the economic development of Australia under the impact of the  gold discoveries, Sinclair pointed out that "the rapid rise in gold production thus  occurred, to some extent, at the expense of other sectors of the economy and led to the  sudden emergence of a new economic structure".42 The sectors of wool, agriculture,  and manufacturing were all adversely affected until 1855. These sectors are called  provisionally 'stagnant sectors' here. This new economic structure underwent a further  change in the latter half of the decade when these sectors developed to compensate the  decline in total output caused by the decline in gold production.  
If the total extent of land under cultivation is treated as an indicator of the  agricultural development, Figure 7-22 shows that there was no significant growth in  agriculture before 1855, and a decline was apparent in 1853 and 1854. In terms of the  number of sheep, the pastoral industry declined from 1852 and had hardly returned to  the level before gold by the end of the decade as shown in Figure 7-23. However, in  terms of the value and quantity of the wool exported, the pastoral industry grew slowly  throughout the decade, with the exception of 1851. These facts tend to suggest that the  wool industry was basically stagnant. Figure 7-23 also shows that the decline in sheep  numbers was offset by a growth in the number of cattle. The raising of cattle could be  regarded as one of the local industries that responded rapidly to the demand for food  production. Figure 7-24 shows that 1853 was the only year when local manufacturing  was affected. From 1854 this industry developed throughout the whole course of the  recession. This experience was different from that of New South Wales.43

43 Maddock and McLean examined the effects of the gold discoveries on manufacturing in New South  Wales in the 1850s in 'Supply-Side Shocks', pp. 15-6. 

The examination of the 'stagnant sectors' suggests that while some sectors of the  economy became over-heated, some of the traditional local industries were in a state of  stagnation. In considering the relationship between the stagnation of local industries and  the surge of imports, it is found that the large amount of imports satisfied the demand of  labour force which was one of the essential factors lead to the enormous economic  expansion in the 1850s, and the decline in over-supply of imports was not due to the  growth of substitutes from the local production in this short period.

The discussion of this chapter so far has proceeded mainly around one central  point - the first boom in imports - through an examination of the first fluctuation in  imports, a measurement of real demand of imports, a discussion of the boom in relation  to imports, commerce and the economy. However, what elements caused the boom in  imports and added difficulties to the adjustment of supply of imports to demand? This  question will be discussed in the last section.  
The causes of the over-supply of imports  
In considering the causes of over-supply of imports during the first fluctuation in  imports, it is noted that the state of over-supply would not have developed so readily  had it not been for four factors. These factors were over-estimation of the demand,  speculating activities, long time-lags in communication of information and transfer of  goods, and government expenditure. These factors will be dealt with in turn. A brief  repetition of some facts and arguments in the previous discussion is unavoidable.  
Over-estimation of the demand situation by suppliers was the primary cause of  the boom in imports. The initial gold discoveries and production greatly enlarged the  demand on the whole. The boom in imports was largely based on the situation of gold  discoveries and production in the whole 1852 and first half of 1853. During this period 

356  
of time successive rich discoveries had attracted a large number of immigrants into the  colony, and gold production reached a high level (for details see Appendixes 1-1, 6-1  and 6-5) Real GDP increased by 250 (in 1851-53).44 Indeed, the demand was greatly  enlarged and the capacity of payment for imports was greatly increased. However, the  output of alluvial gold was not unlimited. In 1852 the output of gold has already reached  the high level that was basically maintained for most of the 1850s. While population and  labour force was increasing all the way, the growth of the economy slowed down either  in terms of the whole or per head. This inevitably affected a further enlargement of  demand. Contemporary estimation of the demand was, however, another matter. In the  period to late 1853 the people both in Australia and overseas were so confident with the  inexhaustibility of the alluvial gold deposits that news of the universal prosperity,  especially the continuing high level of consumption and increasing prices, continued to  be heard in Britain and elsewhere. Large quantities of goods began to pour into Victoria,  and increasingly these supplies were based on the expectation of future market growth.  Many suppliers of imports who had imperfect knowledge or were ignorant of the  changing situation of demand organized the supply at an apparently over-estimated  prospects for gold output and the increasing demand.  
The prospects of highly commercial profits encouraged the speculating  activities.45 Together with the high gold production the costs in the traded-goods sector  increased sharply. Consequently there appeared a remarkable inflation in Victorian  market and in other colonies probably to a lesser extent. There existed, as shown in  Figure 7-3, a big gap in prices between Victoria and source countries of imports,  particularly Britain which directly provided most of the imports into Victoria.46 There  
44 For current Victorian GDP see Butlin and Sinclair's, 'Australian Gross Domestic Product 1788-1860',  p.132; for deflator see Butlin, 'Contours of the Australian Economy 1788-1860', p.113.  
45 The term 'speculation' which is used frequently in Chapters 7 and 8 should be explained. Various  bUSinessmen, local and foreign, were involved in speculative activities in Victoria. While some foreign  traders took part in speculative importing, many local traders imported goods from a similar motive. As  has been discussed in Chapter 3, most of the imports during the the boom in 1853-54 were supplied by  merchants who were newly established after gold. The activities of these merchants have often been  Simply regarded as foreign speculation. I consider the Argus' use of the term to describe the surge in  supply as an oversimplification because the identity and commercial connections of these new mercbants  could not have been very clear at this time.  
46 The annual statistics on sources of imports into Victoria shown in Figure 7-2 indicate that imports  from overseas as a percentage of total consumption rose from 48 % in 1852 to 75 % in 1854. Victoria,  Statistical Registers, 1852-54. Overwhelmingly, these imports came from Britain. In the first quarter of 

357  
were many reports of people rushing into business or into organizing goods in Britain to  be sent to Victoria. It is difficult, however, to make an exact assessment of the  contribution of speculation to the over-supply. Here are selected pieces of evidence to  show the existence of speculative behaviour on the part of overseas businessmen as well  as local merchants.  
With regard to overseas speculators, they knew little or nothing of the real  demand in the colony nor what types of goods were required. They showed no lack of  enterprise in taking advantage of the new market so unexpectedly opened to them.  Therefore, a significant part of imports was brought in without orders from the colony.  These speculators were confident of the continuing prosperity of the new colony and  expected that high profits would easily be reaped and that consumption would be  effectively unlimited. A contemporary report vividly described the situation:  
the import trade for some time past has been in rather an anomalous state.  We have for months been proclaiming a glutted market but all on a sudden  it had been discovered that in many articles, instead of a glut, there was  actual scarcity. The truth seems to be that a great number of very  inexperienced and thoughtless people have moved into trade with the new  country, and in making their purchase, they have not been sufficiently  careful in reference to the quality of the goods, and the mode of  consumption; the result has been that the accumulated old stocks of the old  world have been moved to Melbourne ... they (these goods) became the  only resource of the auction, and a sacrifice.47  
Another report continued the description of the consequence of speculative  
supply:  
we must not omit to mention, as another consequence of the pressure, that  very large quantities of goods have been sacrificed at auction, and  otherwise, which has very materially increased the depression (caused by  the glut) in the regular trade ... Hitherto they have not only been excessive  in quantity but to a great extent unsuitable, ill-packed, or in bad condition.  This, in fact, would rightly describe a large proportion of our surplus  stocks, they are unsalable in the ordinary way, but being almost given  away at auction, people buy and use them, though they are found to be  dear in the end. At the same time this limits the demand for really suitable  goods. 48  
1854, when the amount of imports was at its peak for the decade, shipping from the other Australian  colonies was about 31 % of the total, with 45 % coming from Britain and the remainder from foreign  ports. Argus, 'Shipping Intelligence' , January-March 1854.  
47 Argus, 26 May 1854, p. 5.  
48 Argus, 21 July 1854, p. 5. 
358  
In addition to the speculative manner in which the local importers brought a large  amount of imports into the colony, as has been dealt with in Part Two, the unusual  market behaviour of some local merchants also contributed to the increase in supply of  imports, for it involved hoarding which led to distorted price signals. Soon after the  boom in imports began, supply was felt to be adequate in the market. Prices, however,  did not fully adjust because of hoarding and speculation in stocks. The Argus reported  that large holders of goods were 'inclined to hold on rather than force goods on the  market at the present low figures', and that 'hence there are upon the whole, very few  transactions' .49 It seemed that prices were regulated 'not by the proper law of supply  and demand, but by the urgency of the sale, and the caprice of the moment' .50  Consequently, maintenance of prices became a factor encouraging further supply of  goods. Prices were maintained in this way into the middle of 1853. Serle is incorrect in  thinking that 'throughout 1853, as supply quickly caught up with demand prices fell  rapidly' .51 The fact is that only from the last months of 1853 did some prices start to  decline, as shown in Appendix 6-3.  
The protracted time that it took for news of the changing situation in the Victorian  market to reach overseas suppliers also delayed the adjustment of supply of imports to  demand. A case investigation of the voyage time from Britain to Victoria has been made.  Because the boom in imports lasted from the second quarter of 1853 to the first quarter  of 1854, the voyage time in April 1853 is calculated to represent the boom period.  According to 'Shipping Intelligence' in Argus, 31 ships arrived in Melbourne from  British ports. The average voyage time was 116 days. 7 ships arrived in Melbourne  from American ports with an average voyage time of 121 days. This investigation  suggests that the voyage from Britain, other European countries or America to Victoria  usually took three or four months. Similarly, it is assumed that a return voyage from  Victoria to these countries would take a length of six to eight months, a length that was  
49 Argus, 4 July 1853, p. 5.  
50 Argus, 4 July 1853, p. 5.  
51 Serle, The Golden Age, p. 121. 

359  
similar to that before the gold discoveries. 52 In these circumstances when information  about Victorian demand was provided, it would be about six, seven or even eight  months after the news was dispatched before imports from principal source countries,  Britain in particular, could be adjusted. This time lag delayed the adjustment of supply to  demand. Indeed, it can be found, through the discussion of the first section, that the  time lag was about six months between the sudden increase in prices and the beginning  of the boom in imports. And it was also about six months between the coming of the  commercial recession and the ending of the boom in imports. The slow transferring of  market information worked once again in adding difficulties to the adjustment of supply  of imports to demand in the second surge of imports, although the length of voyage time  was shortened significantly in the latter half of the decade.  
The government expenditure in 1853 and 1854 contributed to the over-supply of  imports. Government expenditure would affect the situation of imports in Australian  colonies in two ways: government could increase or decrease the order for goods  directly or increase or decrease demand indirectly by adjusting the scope and level of  wages or salaries of public sectors. The enormous increase in government expenditure in  Victoria can be seen in two measurements. In absolute terms, the amounts expended in  1853 and 1854 (£3,225,000 and £4,185,000) were 8 and 10 times that of  1851(£409,000). In relative terms, the average of this expenditure per head was £14 in  1853 and 1854 in comparison with an average of £6 in the remaining years of the  1850s.53 This huge amount of expenditure undoubtedly encouraged importing activities.  Moreover, government expenditure had added further difficulties to circulation and  accommodation in banking system, which in tum aggravated the commercial depression.  
A considerable part of government expenditure was borrowed from banks. It was  estimated that when Hotham arrived in June 1854 there was a deficit of £ 1 million.54  This took about 15 per cent of the nearly £ 7 million debts due to banks.55  
52 Another investigation is made for the months of March, April and May of 1851. According to the  same source, 12 ships (their departure and arrival dates were available) arrived in Melbourne from British  ports. The average voyage time was 116 days.

Conclusion  
Three points from the discussion in this chapter may be summarized here. Firstly,  there was a fluctuation of imports in the period from the discoveries of gold to the end of  1854, and the supply of imports greatly exceeded demand for most of the period. The  sharp contradiction between the supply of imports and the demand for them was mainly  caused by the 'boom' in imports that lasted about one year. A basic endogenous model  could help considerably to explain this sharp contradiction. The principal factors within  this model, such as the over-estimation of the demand situation, the speculating  activities, the high transaction cost (mainly expressed as long time-lags in the  communication of information and transfer of goods), resulted in the 'boom' in imports.  The existence of exogenous factors increased the difficulties in adjusting the supply of  imports to demand. The declining output of gold production per head on the goldfields  affected the expected demand, which was premissed on the prosperous situation in gold  mining in the early stages. A great increase in government expenditure in 1853 and 1854  significantly encouraged imports directly and indirectly. Secondly, the fluctuation ,  particularly the boom in supply, resulted in a series of changes in the commercial  situation. The import situation differed from that of commerce because the former  represented the situation of supply only whereas the latter mainly reflected a relation  between demand and supply and a condition for commercial profitability. Three phases  of commercial situation have been identified during this short period. There were  'commercial boom' (from early 1852 to the last months of 1853), 'commercial  recession' (from the end of 1853 to September-October 1854), and 'commercial  depression' ( from October 1854 to the end of that year). Thirdly, the fluctuation ,  especially the boom in imports, formed part of an over-heated or boom situation in some  sectors that were closely associated with the new economic structure brought about by  the gold discoveries. The import situation was closely and directly related to the situation  of demand. The appearance of the boom in imports came after the boom in some other  sectors because the adjustment of supply to demand in imports was not as flexible as in  other sectors. 

361  
Soon after the ending of the first fluctuation of imports, another rise and fall in  
imports occurred in the latter part of the 18505. The adjustment of the supply of imports  
to demand again came across difficulties. However, those factors which had contributed  
to the difficulties in adjustment during the first part of the 18505 underwent changes in  
themselves and new factors played their role in the second half of the 1850s.  
Consequently, the extent to which the supply of imports matched demand changed. This  
adjustment and the changes in the influential factors in the latter part of the 1850s will be  
the topic of the next chapter.
