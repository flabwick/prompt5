Chapter 2  
The Flow of Imports  
Introduction  
The previous chapter examined changes in the demographic situation in Victoria  in the 1850s and some of the implications of these changes for the demand for imports.  This chapter turns to an examination of the flow of imports into Victoria. Imports here  refer all the goods that were brought into the colony by sea or over land from overseas  countries and from other Australian colonies which were detailed in official registers.1  In dealing with Victorian trade in the 1850s, of course, it is necessary to recognise that  international trade should be defined so as to include intercolonial trade. The presence  of neighbouring colonies considerably reduced the range of non-traded goods in  Victoria. 2 The distinction between goods traded internationally and those traded  intercolonially is less important for an understanding of the response of supply of  
1 The registered value of imports was quite closely related to the Victorian tariff system. The selected  tariff system was based on quantities imported, not on valuations, throughout almost the whole of the  1850s. The tariff of 1866 introduced for the Hrst time tariff rates based on the values of most of imports  because the intention was to discriminate on a value basis in order to protect Victorian manufacturing.  Under the 1866 conditions, importers or shippers clearly had an incentive not to overstate the value  (cost) of imports and customs officials had an obligation to try to discover the trade invoices on which  duties might be declared. But until then, there may have been an incentive to state an inaccurate value  but no obligation on the part of customs officials to discover what a proper valuation might have been.  While duties continued to be imposed on quantities, it was the counting of quantities that was the  important matter. Tbe Report of the Board appointed to enquire into the Conditions and Management of  Her Majesty's Customs in 1856 shows that conditions allowed shippers to value imports generally on  the basis of current Victorian prices and to ignore the (mainly British) values. Ships typically stayed a  considerable time in port and there appears to have been little if any control of the movement of crew  members. During the 1850s, when a ship arrived by half past three in the afternoon, the landing  surveyor routinely 'made out a land order to that ship' . The following morning the goods were put into a  ligbter and brought to the wharf, 'then a due account was taken there' . What happened with ships  arriving later in the afternoon is not stated. In either case, there was ample time for the organizers of the  imports to go ashore to check on prices current in port. Even after the 'accounting it was common for a  master to amend his manifest', though at the risk of being Hned. Under the conditions of the time, the  Hne probably only related to quantities and may have reflected clerical annoyance at some master who  decided to land more or less than originally proposed. Because of the diversity of valuation of goods on  many occasions, the value of total imports very probably overstated and at other times understated the  balance of trade obligations to foreign exporters. The process may also have led to inaccuracies in the  estimated value of individual commodities and hence in the proportions of different items in the total  
imports.  
2 Traded goods are all those that are traded internationally and are taken to include domestic production  that is exposed to import competition. Non-traded goods are domestically produced goods that for cost  reasons are. not exposed to international trade. A brief discussion of the behaviour of traded and non-traded  goods in the Australian economy in the 1850s is to be found in R. Maddock and I. McLean, 'Supply 
Side Shocks' .

imports to demand than the fact that the overwhelming majority of goods supplied to  Victoria in the 1850s came from outside the colony.  
In an enquiry into the flow of imports as a whole, a number of questions need to  be examined. First, the position of imports in the economy throughout the decade  should be assessed so as to provide a broad background against which the details  relating to the supply of imports can be examined. Then, in considering the implications  of total imports for individuals, real imports per head need to be estimated. Next, an  analysis of the composition of imports has to be made with the aim of seeing what  changes occurred in the structure of imports under the impact of the enormous changes  in demand taking place in the 1850s. The composition of imports could also change to a  certain extent because of the development of local industries for import replacement.  Finally, the advantageous nature of the Victorian tariff system should be examined, for  this partly explains the enormous inflow of imports, particularly in the period to the end  of 1854. These questions are discussed in separate sections.  
The re-estimation of real imports per head and the classification of total imports  are an important part of the work of this chapter. The existing statistics relating to  imports into Victoria consist of a list of separate items and their values originally  registered by the Customs Office. These data show the values of gross imports  including re-exports in current prices, but do not classify imports in any clean way into  different categories such as foodstuffs, household-goods, apparel, building materials  and transport. The direct use of these data can yield neither estimates of net imports per  head in current value, nor the composition of total imports.  
The shift to imports  
The change in the importance of imports that followed the discovery of gold in  Victoria is very striking. Table 2-1 shows the level of imports as a percentage of gross  domestic product in current prices in both Victoria and New South Wales. Victorian  imports surged to a level equal to 58.4 per cent of GDP in 1854 and remained at about  40 per cent for the rest of the gold decade. New South Wales had a similar but less 
60  
striking experience, with imports surging and falling back in the Victorian manner, but  with the import share of GDP was lower than in Victoria throughout. The great  dependence of Victoria on imports is one of the most marked changes in the economic  activity to arise from the discovery of gold. The extraordinarily high proportion of  Victorian expenditure on imports meant that this had become an exceptionally open  economy, with a truly massive shift away from import competing activity in Victoria  itself and possibly also away from non-traded goods production. The importance of  imports in the economy gives rise a further question: how did the total imports match  the demand for imports? An answer to this question depends on an accurate valuation of  imports per head. This will be discussed in the third section.

Notes and sources: The calculation of net imports will be explained in section 2. Specie and  livestock are omitted from the Victorian estimates for reasons discussed later  but have been left in NSW where they are too small to affect the calculation.  The imports are estimates of net imports from Victoria, Statistical Registers,  1850-60. The estimates of GDP are taken from Butlin and Sinclair, 'Australian  Gross Domestic Product', pp. 131-2.  
The figures in Table 2-1 show two occasions in the 1850s when imports rose  very strongly and two occasions when they fell as a proportion of GDP. It is interesting  that in both colonies imports as a fraction of GDP actually fell in the early stages of the  gold discoveries, that is in 1851-1852. Was this a commercial depression or was it due  to disorganization amongst import businesses in the two colonies, perhaps directly the 
61  
result of labour flocking to the goldfields? Were ships too busy bringing in migrants to  allow room for cargoes? Was there in fact a situation of insufficient supply? The two  series of current values suggest that from 1853 to 1854 in Victoria there was an  enormous increase in expenditure on imports relative to total incomes. The decline of  imports in GDP also rise a question: were losses made by importers on the scale  suggested by the subsequent decline in the ratio in 1855 or was there merely a downturn  in speculative expectations? The recovery of imports during 1856 and 1857 in both  colonies is suggestive of a second boom, though a less sharp one than after 1853, and  similarly the decline towards the end of the 1850s is less marked than before. These  phenomena have been noted in the literature. For example, Serle says: 'Victoria of the  fifties is an exceptional case in Australian history. But it had cyclical problems enough of  its own of which the most important, perhaps, were the fluctuations in import 
consignments which continually upset the market and had wide repercussions'.1  However, so far there is no detailed study of imports in terms of supply response to the  demand. The shortcomings of the existing literature in relation to this issue and the  question of the fluctuation in imports will be examined in detail in Part 3.  
The most important reasons for the flood of imports entering Victoria were the  greatly increased demand and suddenly increased ability to pay for them due to gold  mining. These questions have been examined above. However, to answer the question  what did the flood of imports mean for individuals, it is necessary to estimate the value  of net imports in constant prices per head. This will be done in next section.  
Re-estimates of imports  
The flood of imports into Victoria was registered as aggregated imports in current  prices. For the sake of an examination of the effects of the changes in demand on the  supply of imports, an accurate estimation of the quantity imports is necessary. This can  
1 Serle, The Golden Age, p. 240.

be done in two steps: firstly, an estimation of net imports in current prices and secondly,  an estimation of net imports in constant prices.  
Ne.! imports  
As the statistics for re-exports of individual commodities are unavailable for the  years to 1859, net imports cannot be calculated directly. The statistics from 1842,  however, do specify the volumes of exports of Victorian produce and this makes an  estimation of net imports possible. If exports of Victorian produce are subtracted from  aggregate exports the remainder will be re-exports, and when re-exports are deducted  from aggregate imports, the remainder will be net imports. 'Specie' is excluded from  both imports and exports in the course of the estimation. Table 2-2 shows the results of  the estimation and the estimation procedure is reported in Appendix 2-1. Due to the  possible problem of time lag, amounts re-exported in one year may partly be goods  imported in earlier years,

Table 2-2 shows that the estimate of net imports in current value was very close to  
that of aggregate imports. In no year between 1845 and 1856 (with the exception of  1855) was the share of net imports lower than 95 per cent. That share started to decline  from 1857 and continued in the 1860s. This suggests that the imports supplied before  1857 were mainly consumed locally. After 1857 re-exports increased noticeably and  from that time to the end of the decade the value of re-exports as a percentage of the total  value of imports increased from 5 per cent to around 10 per cent. This implies that,  while the volume of gold production was declining, the continuous increase of  population led to a reduction in income per head and a consequent fall in per capita  demand for imports. The ratio of net imports to aggregate imports also indicated that  Victorian seaports for most of the 1850s, as in the period before the gold rush, were  principally used for local needs instead of entrepot trade.  
Net imports in constant value  
Where both quantities and values are entered in the trade returns, a unit value can  
be calculated, at least in principle. In all, some 230 separate commodities are listed and  of these standard quantity units are given for only 36. Appendix 2-2 shows the names  and classifications of these separate commodities. This does not look very promising.  Moreover, several of these commodities are discarded for special reasons. Thus there is  little point in including livestock imports where the inclusion of stud animals could affect  quality comparisons. Nor is it appropriate to include items that were probably brought in  as ballast ( bricks and stones), but which were sold in response to high prices offering.  In the end only 24 items can be used: flour, rice, butter, salt, fruits, potatoes,  provisions, cheese, tobacco, sugar, spirits, wine, tea, coffee, beer, candles, soap, coal,  slate, timber, iron, malt, oats, and barley. These are all goods arriving by sea and will to  some extent include intercolonial goods. Short as the list is, these 24 commodities  account for an average of over 50 per cent of the total imports to Victoria by sea  throughout the 1850s (valued at official prices). The most important omission is that of  clothing and footwear, where no uniformity of packing units existed. Table 2-3 shows  the proportion of the 24 commodities in relation to total imports into Victoria

The calculated prices of these 24 items are used to construct an import price  
index. The 24 items are divided into three groups representing three categories of  imports: consumer goods, capital goods and grains. Three series of indexes are  calculated and are combined into a combined import price index. The individual, group  and combined indexes are calculated and weighted by the average value in 1848-50. To  give a fuller perspective on the changes occurring during the 1850s, the various series  run through from 1845 to 1865. For the sake of comparison and reference, similar  indexes are also established based on average prices and values in 1858-60. Detailed  explanation of the procedures for constructing the import index is provided in Appendix  2-3 (1)-(9). These indexes are shown in Figures 2-1 to 2-4.

The price index of consumer goods mainly represents the fluctuations in the  
prices of imported foodstuffs. This is because the current value of those items indexed  constituted no less than 94 per cent of all the foodstuffs imported in the decade. The  index does not directly represent price movements of apparel and household soft-goods.  Only to a minor extent does it represent the price of household goods through the  inclusion of soap, candles, and coal in the index. In comparing the two series of ratios  of indexed goods with the two large categories (consumer goods and capital goods), it is  found that the index of capital goods is better than that of consumer goods, because the  index of capital goods is weighted substantially by timber and iron and steel which are  closely related to building materials, finished and unfinished metal goods.  
The estimated constant values of the net imports are further divided by the  
changing size of the population. Table 2-4 shows imports per head in current and  
constant measurements and suggests three points.

First, imports per head were not as high as generally thought, once a proper  
allowance is made for price changes. General historians and economic historians usually  use aggregate and current values to measure the enonnous extent to which the goods  were imported.1 This type of assessment, consequently, have largely exaggerated the  situation of imports. The common impression seems to be that the supply of imports in  the 1850s, even in tenns of value per head, was many times higher than in the period  before gold discoveries. Thus, according to G. Blainey, 'in one year, 1853, twenty-four  pairs of boots were imported for each person in the colony; six million pairs glutted the  warehouses and goldfields stores'.2 Victorian statistics, however, show that the current  value of boots and shoes per head was slightly below Â£2 in 1853, while Coghlan gave  the prices of footwear in the middle of 1855 as follows: Men's stout shoes, pair, 9s-lOs  
1 There are many such descriptions in historical writings. For example, according to Dunolly: 'in 1852  Victoria's imports were estimated at Â£29 per head, but in 1853 the average rose to Â£79 ... during 1854 ...  the average imports per head was Â£70', 'Effects of Gold Rushes in the 1850s', pp. 99-100.

6d, Women's stout shoes, pair, 4s-4s 6d, Wellington boots (imported), pair, 20s-25s. 1  Moreover, the prices in the middle of 1855 were much lower than one or two years  before. So, it might be that imports have been exaggerated by some historians, even if  sales below cost are taken into account. Note the following in relation to Table 2-4:  Column (1) shows that if gross imports per head in current prices are used above, the  conclusion about the amount of imports would be much the same as that reached by  previous studies; Column (2) shows, however, that net imports per head are noticeably  lower than gross prices from 1852; Column (3) of this table further shows that the peak  of net imports per head in constant prices is limited to 1853 and 1854, with 1856 also  notable, but to a lesser extent. Even in these two years, 1853 and 1854, the constant  value of imports per head was about 2-3 times the level prevailing before the gold  discoveries. In other years, imports per head were basically at or below the level before  gold. Net imports in constant prices after 1860 were obviously lower than in the period  before 1851. The constant value index is unlikely to be wholly accurate as it covers only  about 50 per cent of import values in the 1850s and the proportions were even lower  before and after that. Nevertheless, it seems clear that, when viewed against the growth  of population, the goods supplied by importation were much less than has been  previously been thought. The situation of surplus supplies should be limited to 1853-4  and 1856, even if the real income of Victorians in the 1850s was similar to that in the  period before gold. If rea] income increased, the extent of the surplus situation should be  smaller. So, it can be found that the influence of the gold discoveries on imports was  apparent, but not as great as the previous studies thought.  
Second, fluctuations in imports are clearly hinted at. The question of the  
'commercial depression' (these terms will be explained in Part Three) that are said to  have occurred in Victoria is too relevant to the central argument of this thesis to disregard  the way imports affected the commercial situation in the gold decade. As analysed  above, the years 1853-1854 and 1856 were closely related to the boom, whereas 1855  was a year of remarkable depression, and the years after 1857 were a period of

recession.in commerce. A detailed discussion of the situations in regard to imports,  commerce and the economy in general will be given in Part Three.  
Third, this import price index makes possible the examination of the extent to  
which movements in official import prices and domestic prices conformed to each other.  With regard to domestic prices, one secondary source exists, the index of basic  commodities prepared by Maddock and McLean.l But this should not to be relied on too  much. For one thing it is an index of basic commodities. In addition it is produced from  only six commodities and even then the prices of meat, tea and sugar are taken from  non-Victorian sources (This will be further discussed in Part Three). Discarding this and  the similar efforts made by Coghlan,2 the wholesale prices published in the Victorian  Statistical Register will now be considered. Here, unfortunately, the data are limited to  that in W.H. Archer's first Register, covering the period 1848-54 and the 1863, Register  which provides a series back to 1854. Archer's prices are not consistent with the later  series, being a mix of wholesale and retail prices, and they cover only a few relevant  commodities. These are, therefore, discarded (it is intended in Part Three on fluctuations  in imports to work on newspaper price data to cover Archer's period) and attention is  confined to a comparison with the later Register series only from 1854.  
The domestic prices of fourteen commodities are available for direct comparison  
with import price movements. As the Register provided only price ranges, I have used  
the mid-point of these ranges in the comparison. Figure 2-5 shows the resultant indexes  of import and wholesale prices of Melbourne (1858-60 = 1(0), and is compiled by the  procedures explained in Appendix 2-4. Apart from the limitations of the Victorian data,  there is the difficulty that British prices were affected by Australian and American gold  production. Both the Rousseaux and Sauerbeck price indexes show a more sustained  rise in British prices to a new level which was maintained throughout the 1850s after  
1 The index of Victorian basic commodities was first compiled by Maddock and McLean, 'Supply-Side  Shocks'. pp. 23-5 and then it was used by Shergold in 'Price and Consumption', p. 212.  
2 Coghlan provided two estimates of living costs in the 1850s. One consisted of two statements  published by the Melbourne Labour Committee in May and November 1854 concerning the ordinary  weekly expenses of a working-class family . Another was derived from account of Archer. the Registrar General of Victoria on the typical expenses for one week of an artisan's family in 1857 and 1861.  Cogblan.

1853. 1 In the absence of Victorian price data before 1854, comparison must be  somewhat uncertain, but there is a strong suggestion that Victorian price levels were  significantly more unstable than those in Britain and that Victorian import valuations  conformed to the Victorian rather than the British pattern. It is reasonably clear from  Figure 2-5 that the import price and wholesale price series for the matching commodities  moved almost identically during this period, except for 1855-6 when the import price  index tended to be lower (about one-eighth) than the wholesale price.

It would seem that amendments to Victorian import values are necessary if a  correct estimate of payments due abroad on account of imports is to be made. One  possible method could be to replace the unit values with British prices adjusted for  freight and insurance. These adjustments, however, lie outside the scope of this thesis.  
The discussion in this section has led to a new assessment of the value of  imports and their fluctuations under the effects of changes in demand. For a further  assessment, the composition of the imports will be analysed in the following section.

71  
The compnsition of imports  
The purpose of identifying different types of imports is to look into any changes  in the structure of imports that were brought about by changes in demand. This analysis  should provide the basis for an enquiry into various specialized commercial businesses  that dealt in only one or a few commodities, although that enquiry is outside the scope of  this thesis. When the discussion turns from aggregate imports to the question of import  composition these valuation problems are less of a concern, because the proportion of  each import or import group is unlikely be affected very much. Questions of  composition are best dealt with using current rather than constant price measures, as  scholars such as Butlin and Kuznets generally preferred to do when analysing  structure.! In examining the question a longer period beyond the 1850s is investigated as  it was when considering imports and GOP. Hence the structure of Victorian imports is  measured, over the period 1842 to 1865.  
Detailed reporting of the relative importance of each of more than 200 imported  commodities would not be very meaningful. In a few cases, the relative importance of  some specific commodities may be of interest, but generally what is important is to  produce summary classifications of imports. Various principles of classification have  been suggested by different writers, distinguishing, for example, between durable and  non-durable goods, and so forth.  
Imports are here divided into two major groups :capital and consumption goods.  A grouping has been made into eight categories: foodstuffs, apparel, household, soft goods, building materials, transport equipment and materials, fmished metal goods, and  unfinished metal goods. The consumer goods include the former four categories and the  capital goods consist of the latter four. The details of each category are shown in  Appendix 2-5. However, none of these groupings can be defined exactly. The dividing  line between capital and consumption goods is often difficult, the inherent conceptual  problems being made worse by the obscurity of some of the descriptions of commodities  
1 Kuznets's Economic Growth and Structure might be regarded as representative of his method of  measuring economic structure in current prices. Butlin's treatment of economic structure in current prices  is found in Investment in Australian Economic Development, and in many other writings. 
72  
in the trade statistics. Some guesswork is needed and judgment has had to be exercised  in allocating goods between some of the groupings. As classified at present, some items  such as cotton waste and wicks might be household softgoods, other household  materials, or even manufacturing materials (for cleaning machinery, etc.) In general,  efforts have been made to minimize the allocations to the miscellaneous category and this  has on one or two occasions meant that some items have been entered in a particular  category without very strong or confident reasons for doing so. These arbitrary  decisions, however, are not very important in practice, for almost all the items fall  reasonably readily into the classifications adopted. These categories are also approximate  enough to study the distribution of expenditure by the Victorian population. Table 2-5  shows imports of consumer and capital goods as a percentage of gross imports for the  years 1842-65.

Table 2-5 suggests that, with exception of 1853 and 1854, the proportions of the  
two major groups of imports remained stable and fluctuated only slightly during these  two decades. This further suggests that the enormous changes in demand did not bring  about a substantial change in the structure of imports as a whole. As one would expect,  consumer goods accounted for by far the largest part of the total imports. This slight  movement of these shares does not suggest that gold led to exceptionally high levels of  consumer expenditure, though a resolution of this question also requires an assessment  of the real incomes of the labour force in Victoria as a result of the gold discoveries. The  issue is also clouded by the fact that the only available price data consist of wholesale  prices, while retail prices are more relevant. It appears that a significant fraction of  imports throughout the whole gold decade took the form of capital goods and for 1853  and 1854 the proportion of these items was higher than throughout most of the 1840s  and 1850s The final column of Table 2-5, indeed, shows that the ratios of consumer  goods to capital goods was higher in 1852, 1856 and 1859. This fact is closely related to  the sudden increase in population in 1852, influx of colonial immigrants in 1856 and an  apparent growth of the economy in 1859 that would lead to increase of consumption.l  
A further examination will be made of a sub-division of capital and consumer  
goods so as to develop some of the implications for importers, auctioneers and  commercial businesses of other functions. In the case of capital goods, Table 2-5 shows  that building imports dominated throughout except at the very close of the gold decade.  There would appear to have been a potentially thriving business in particular in dealing  in timber and related materials. Nevertheless, there is clearly a structural shift in the mid 
1850s. Imports of transport materials lifted sharply to a new level and their share of the  total continued to rise until 1860. If these imports were on private account, the  opportunities for commercial business may have only experienced a structural shift. If  they were for government, however, it is possible that there was a narrowing of  business opportunities because government may have imported these goods directly. It

is also interesting that both finished and unfinished metal imports increased their share.  Again government may have been involved. In these cases, the increase in their shares  of total imports began a year earlier, in 1854, and levelled off at the end of the 1850s.

In the case of consumer goods, there appear to have been quite marked  fluctuations and some very large structural changes in the four categories. Leaving aside  the fluctuations in some of the shares, the total was dominated by foodstuffs, clothing  and apparel. 'Foodstuffs' include spirits, wine, beer, cider and perry, and the details in  Appendix 2-3 (2) and Appendix 2-5 show that the average proportion of 'spirits',  'wines' and 'beer' (beer, cider and perry) in total 'foodstuffs' in 1848-50 was 47 per  cent, representing a much higher proportion than 36 per cent in 1852-54. Historians' 
75  
conception of gold discoveries leading to a great increase in the import of alcohol do not  seem to be well-founded. 1 Unless local alcohol production increased greatly, it may be  that the opportunities for traders including importers and auctioneers disposing of liquor  were much more limited than have been suggested. There appear to have been a wide  variety of business opportunities for importers in dealing with a large number of  'ordinary' foodstuffs.  
The two main structural changes appear to have taken place in the more domestic  products: household goods and softgoods. The former (leaving aside a peak in 1854)  rose to a distinctly high level in approximately the mid-1850s, providing considerably  enlarged business opportunities in this area. By contrast, softgoods suffered a severe  relative decline. The extent to which this was due to changed consumption by Victorians  or to the development of locally produced goods replacing imports is unclear.  
The Victorian tariff system  
Commercial policies are usually important influences on commercial conditions.  In Victoria in the 1850s, a substantial quantity of goods were supplied from outside the  colony, and a large part of commercial transactions related to importing. A major feature  of commercial policy was the tariff which represented government intervention for the  raising revenue. The Victorian tariff system, in comparison with other colonies,  promoted importing activities and increased the amount of imports in the 1850s through  its simpler procedure and lower rates. The discussion below will deal with the role of  the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce in relation to the tariff system. Nonetheless, the  focus of this section is on the advantageous nature of the tariff system in promoting  imports.  
1 For example, Fitzpatrick particularly talked about the increase of liquors imported, and agreed that  'Victoria has such a reputation for drunkenness that shippers have considered it impossible to glut this  market with liquors', The British Empire in Australia, p. 115. 
76  
The tariff system before gold  
The idea of levying a duty on imports to help finance the local administration  was attractive to the early governors of New South Wales such as Phillip and Hunter.!  King extended this duty in several ways, most importantly by establishing in 1802 a  new duty of 5 per cent on all wares and merchandise brought from any place to the east  of the Cape and on other goods not of British manufacture. 2 The 5 per cent duty of  1802 marked the establishment of the ad valorem system in Australia which continued  for the next half century in the colonies of New South Wales, Victoria and Van  Diemen's Land, and longer still in South Australia. At this early stage, import duties  were levied by the local administration, not by the home government. The British  government regarded the Australian settlements as little more than remote gaols and put  them outside the scope of the Possession Act which mainly regulated the British  Atlantic colonies. The British government itself was not concerned with the levying of  import duties in Australia, though it recognized the importance of raising revenue from  local sources.3 The tariffs were obviously of an expedient nature and were designed  largely to raise revenue from the import trade, especially in spirits. Even so, the tariff,  by exempting British manufactures coming directly to the colony, was consistent with  the imperial policy of British preference which applied in all colonies before the coming  of free trade. An Act of 1819 was the first legislative endorsement of the Australian  system by the British government, and for the first time the policy of British preference  was officially applied to the Australian colonies.4  
1 La Nauze, 'Australian Tariffs and Imperial Control', p. 1. As early as 1791 Phillip suggested LO the  British Secretary of State for the Colonies the collection of duties on spiriLS to benefit the Crown. La  Nauze, 'Australian Tariffs and Imperial Control', note 8, p. 2. Hunter made a similar suggestion in  l796, and in 1800 he introduced an 'assessment' on spiriLS, wine and other strong drinks. Effectively,  this marked the first duties imposed upon imporlS into Australia.  
2 La Nauze, 'Australian Tariffs and Imperial Control', nOle 22, p. 5.  
3 La Nauze, 'Australian Tariffs and Imperial Control', note 33, p. 7. After many reporLS by the  governors on the necessity of controlling the traffic in spiriLS, the British Secretary of Slate for the  Colonies wrote to Macquarie in 1809 saying that 'the period is not far distant when a very considerable  part of the expenditure of tbe colony Can be defrayed out of tbe colonial revenue'.  
4 La Nauze, 'Australian Tariffs and Imperial Control', p. 12. This Act stipulated 10 shillings per gallon  on spiriLS, 6 pence per pound on tobacco and an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent on all articles, with the  exception of British manufactures directly imported from Great Britain. These duties, however,  represented littJe new to the previous local regulations. 
77  
Soon afterwards, the free trade movement gathered strength in Britain. 1 As part  of this process, the British government gradually changed its attitude towards tariffs in  the colonies. A circular despatched on 28 June 1843 to governors announced the  prohibition of new differential tariffs throughout the empire.2 The prohibition of new  differential duties received parliamentary sanction some years later.  
When the Constitution Act was passed in 1842, a partly representative  government with a Legislative Council was established in the Australian colonies. The  governor and the Council were empowered to impose or alter tariffs. Though Stanley's  despatch of 1843 prohibited new differential tariffs, the existing discriminatory tariffs  remained untouched till 1852. After the passage of the Australian Colonial Government  Act in 1850, the Australian colonies were able to frame their own constitutions and  could legislate more freely on their tariffs. By early 1851, the four colonies of Australia  had tariffs formed under various influences from the mother country and expedient  considerations of local interests. The result was a strange melange of tariff anomalies.  The principles of free trade, preferential tariffs and the general ad valorem tariff were  unsystematically mixed in the various colonial tariffs. In the new colony of Victoria,  the existing tariff rates had been taken over directly from the mother colony. Though  Victoria now had the power to impose duties according to its own needs, the borrowed  tariff was still intact when gold was discovered. 3  
The Tariff system in the J 850s after the gold discoveries  
The enormous increase in population after the gold discoveries had probably the  most far-reaching effect of any social phenomenon on many sectors of the economy.  The rapid growth of population, in terms of its implication for the tariff, brought two  changes to the colony. Firstly, a large amount of extra revenue was needed to fund the  consequent increase in government expenditure. As customs duties were an important  
IThe growth of British industry and the increased potential for dominating world markets in  manufacturing were important factors behind the movement towards the free trade. The reduction of  British tariffs in 1822, 1826, 1842, and 1846, and the abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846 and the  Navigation Acts in 1849 are regarded as a sequence of the movement. By 1850 the principle of free trade  had come to dominate British commercial policy.

78  
part of total revenue, it was imperative that they be collected efficiently. However, the  problem was that greater difficulties were now being experienced in measuring and  collecting the import duties under the existing tariff system and the existing customs  administration. The government thus sought to alter the tariff system so as to enable  sufficient revenue to be collected in a simplified manner. Secondly, quick entry and  distribution of supplies was made necessary by the increasing demand and was  required by commercial interests as well. The existing tariff system often caused delays  because of the complicated arrangements for the measurement and collection of duties.  
In these circumstances, The government abolished the ad valorem system and  adopted a selected tariff system by imposing a duty only on five types of goods on  quantities. l The abolition of the ad valorem tariff system meant that a great obstacle to  the rapid growth in imports had been removed. The simplified tariff greatly facilitated  the increase in imported supplies in the 1850s, particularly in the first few years of that  decade. The modified tariff of 1852, which was intended to meet the new economic  situation brought about by the gold discoveries and the prevailing atmosphere of free  trade, lasted well into the 1860s without substantial alteration. It was regarded as 'the  first real tariff of the colony'.2 From the point of view of the government, the Act  brought an increase in customs revenue as imports rose, even though rates per unit  were low. The government was happy with the new tariff system till the end of 1854,  mainly because it was impossible within a short time to increase the capacity of the  customs administration, the wharfs. and the storage facilities to the scale that would be  necessary for a comprehensive tariff system. The sector which benefited most from the  modification of the tariff was the commercial, because a overwhelming part of the  imported articles were now free of duty, and also because much time was saved for the  mercantile community, especially importers and auctioneers, by the simpler procedures  made possible by the new tariff structure. The tariff changes partly explain the  magnitude of the import boom of the early 1850s.

Towards the end of 1854, budgetary difficulties forced the government to raise  the rates and enlarge the coverage of duties. l The rates of duties were raised in spirits,  wines, tobacco, and tea, and the duties were extended to sugar, molasses and treacle. 2  Form the end of 1854 till 1866 there was no substantial change in the tariff system of  Victoria, although the coverage of the duties was enlarged again in 1862. The tariff of  1866 marked the first tariff of Victoria with a protective nature by which, except the  articles already under duties, all other goods imported were levied 5 per cent of ad  valorem.3  
The Melbourne Chamber of Commerce made a great effort to persuade the  government to abolish the ad valorem system in 1852 and later launched a movement  against the attempt to restore the ad valorem system at the end of 1854. The Melbourne  Chamber of Commerce represented the most prominent organization in protecting  commercial interests and in promoting commercial conditions in Victoria in the 1850s 4  When the government had shown a clear intention to alter the existing tariff system no  later than February 1852,5 the Chamber lost no time in promoting a new tariff. 6 The  Chamber fully understood the basis of the government's proposed alteration to the tariff  and was particularly conscious of the government's desire to ensure an adequate revenue  
1 It seemed to the Lieutenant-Governor that 'the duty on imports was the only available mode of  increasing ... revenue'. Argus, 30 November 1854, p. 5.  
2 For details of the amended tariff see Appendix 2-6.  
3 For details of the rates of tariff in 1862 and 1866 see Appendix 2-6.  
4 The Chamber's aim of promoting and protecting commercial interests was clearly declared when the  organization was established and was reinforced throughout the 1850s, and continued to be the basis to  its activities. At the first annual meeting, the report of the Chamber's corrunittee stated that the object of  the Chamber was 'removal of evils and the protection of the general interests of the trade of the colony' .  Argus 2 April 1852, p. 2. At the third annual meeting the committee looked on the Chamber as 'the  guardian of the mercantile interests' . Argus 3 April 1854, p. 5. James M'Cullocb, president of the  Cbamber in 1856, also saw the Chamber as representing the mercantile interest of Victoria Argus, 4  December 1856, p. 5. The consistent aims and constant efforts of the Chamber united most of the  merchants in the colony, particularly the merchants in Melbourne. The initial membership in 1851 was  over 100. Membership had increased to 162 by March 1854 and again to 225 in April 1855. Argus 3  April 1854 p. 5, Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, Jubilee of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce,  p. 8. In April 1856 the mercantile corrununity had 'almost unanimously ... enrolled themselves amongst  its members' . Argus, 8 April 1856. p. 4. The large membership had by this time made the Chamber an  organization that 'neither the Government nor the Legislative Council as at present constituted can afford  to despise' . Argus, 8 April 1856 p. 4.  
5 A report in Argus described that 'we believe it was the intention of the Government to introduce  extensive and beneficial alterations into the Customs Department, by liberalising the present tariff, and  abolishing all Port Dues; and we congratulated the Executive on that indication of its desire to adopt a  wise and enlightened system of commercial policy'. Argus, 1 March 1852, p. 2.

from the tariff. The Chamber quickly started work on a specific plan and in July 1852 it  submitted a memorandum to the Legislative Council expressing its views on the existing  tariff and proposing a new scale of duties.! The Cham ber proposed that selected duties  be limited to six articles: spirits, wines, tobacco, tea, sugar, and coffee. 2 These articles  were thought to be 'articles of extensive consumption, and at the same time are not to be  considered as necessaries of life. They are therefore the proper and usual objects of a  high rate of duty'.3 The remaining imports, including many in great demand, would  enter the colony free of duties. An advantage of this would be that the procedures of  declaration would be simplified, the expenses of the customs administration would be  reduced, false declarations would be eliminated, and the operation of importation would  be materially facilitated.4  
The influence of the Chamber on the new tariff was embodied in the Act passed  on August 14, 1852 as can be seen from Table 2-7. The table shows that the  differences between the two schedules of duties are limited to the deletion of sugar and  the imposition of higher charges on spirits and tea. There was thus no substantial  difference between the proposed tariff rates and the Act. According to La Nauze, 'the  Government and the Chamber of Commerce were thinking as one'.5  
When there was a substantial need to raise revenue from tariff duties at the end of  1854, the government faced two choices: to return to ad valorem system or to raise the  selected duties and extend the duties to few more articles. While acknowledging the  'necessity of an increased revenue in the present exigencies of the Government', the  Chamber opposed the restoration of the ad valorem system due to two worries: it was  feared that Melbourne's position as the commercial centre of the Australian colonies  would be injured, and much time would be wasted in measurement of the quantities of  
1 The Committee of the Chamber was fully aware that a necessary condition of the alteration of the  tariff was 'compatible witb tbe safely of tbe public revenue'. They believed the scale of the duties would  'assimilate with the changes now in contemplation by the Executive'. Argus, 2 April 1852, p. 2.  2 La Nauze, 'Merchants in Action'. note 10. p. 81.

imports and collection of duti es.! Since the government was determined upon an  increase in tariff revenue, the Chamber proposed an increase in selected tariff duties as a  means of achieving this. On December 4 the Chamber submitted to the Collector of  Customs a petition including its tariff proposals. Comparison of Tables 2-7 and 2-8  shows that the charges increased by 100 per cent for all spirits and wines, by 200 per  cent on tea and coffee, and by 50 per cent on tobacco and cigars.

The influence of the Chamber in preventing the restoration of the ad valorem  system can be seen in the similarity of the proposed rates and the actual tariff rates in  the Act passed in December 1854. On December 8, 1854 the Collector of Customs  presented the Chamber's petition to the Legislative Council, and when he moved the  second reading of the Customs Duties Bill, the Collector of Customs explained to the  House the views held by the Government. The rates of duties he proposed were almost  the same as those proposed by the Chamber,2 and, as Table 2-8 shows, there was no  significant difference between the Chamber's proposal and the actual rates in the Act.  In June and July 1855 the Chamber fought successfully against another attempt by the  government to return to the ad valorem system. The basic stand of the Chamber was

The efforts of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce to abolish the ad valorem  system and maintain a selected tariff has been dealt with above. A fuller study of the  Chamber's role in improving commercial conditions is outside the scope of this thesis. 1  Nonetheless, there is evidence to show that most of the leading members of the  Chamber were actively involved in importing activities.2  
The impact of the selected tariff on imports  
Now the discussion needs to go back to the main topic of this section: how did  the selected tariff system favour importing and contribute to the flood of imports? When  the question of whether the selected tariff or the ad valorem system was more  advantageous in encouraging an increased imports is considered, it is found that the  
1 The Melbourne Chamber of Commerce was concerned with a wide range of social and commercial  issues. In regard to commerce the Chamber put its greatest efforts into question of the tariff and into  improving Melbourne's port facilities.  
2 A comparison has been made between the members of the committee of the Chamber of Commerce  who took part in committee meetings between 1851 and 1859 and the list of importers in Appendix 3-2.  The results shows that most of the committee members were involved in importing activities. The  names of these members are found in Cooper Victorian Commerce, pp. 16 and 41; Argus, 2 April 1851,  2 January 1852, 10 May 1853,26 May 28 and July 1854, 16 January, 23 April and 18 December 1856,  7 May and 12 October 1857, 24 February 1858 and 28 December 1859.

simplicity of measurement of imports and the low duty rates that were characteristic of  the selected tariff system lowered transaction costs as compared to those involved in the  tariff systems of the other Australian colonies.  
The time saved when imports entered the colony that resulted from the simplicity  of the system is difficult to evaluate directly because this was evident only when a large  volume of imports arrived. The increase in imports began in late 1852 whereas the ad  valorem system had been abolished in August of that year. So it is not possible to say  how much time was saved under the selected tariff system. Nonetheless, there is some  indirect evidence provided by contemporary opinion. Before the ad valorem system was  abolished, it was recognized in commercial circles that much time was wasted on the  assessment of imports and the collection of duties; it was considered that the ad valorem  duties were 'most injurious and prejudicial to the system of trade in the colony'.l It  was also described that 'whatever the percentage [of the tariff duties] was, and flxed,  however it might be on per hundred-weight, yard, or gallon, the collection of duties  under the system, would be found to be inoperative, and, in fact, impossible'.2 It can  be assumed that the time taken in assessing only a few items would be less than that  taken in assessing all imports.  
On the other hand, dutied articles as a proportion of imports and customs revenue  as a proportion of the value of imports show the advantages of the selected tariff. Dutied  articles formed a small proportion of the imported goods throughout the 1850s. When  the ad valorem system existed, according to O'Shanassy, customs duties were levied on  160 articles, representing nearly all imported articles. 3 In the period between the gold  discoveries and the abolition of the ad valorem tariff, most imports came from other  Australian colonies. At this time New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South  Australia all had ad valorem tariffs with similar rates. When large volumes of foreign  goods started to arrive in Australia in the last months of 1852, the tariff systems of the  Australian colonies began to diverge. New South Wales and Victoria adopted the

selected tariff system in August 1852, and Tasmania followed suit shortly after. The  proportion of dutied articles among imports to these colonies, therefore, shrank greatly.  There were only seven articles under duties in Victoria and seventeen in New South  Wales (see Appendices 2-1 and 2-2). Table 2-9 shows that dutiable articles made up 21  per cent of imports in 1852 and only 16 per cent of imports in 1854, at the height of the  boom. The dutiable proportion rarely exceeded 20 per cent during the 'remainder of the  1850s, in spite of the increase in the rates of duty in December 1854. This was the  smallest proportion of dutiable articles in the Australian colonies, and this contributed to  the generally favourable commercial situation enjoyed most by the Victorian importers.

The advantageous nature of the Victorian tariff system for commercial interests  is evident when comparison is made with South Australia, where the ad valorem  system was retained throughout the 1850s. In the period from 22 October 1851 to 22  November 1853, the rates of duties in South Australian ranged between 5 and 10 per  cent. After the latter date the rates were limited to 5 per cent till a new Act was  introduced in J ul y 1860 that pruned and sim plified the tariff, bringing it as close as  possible to that of Victoria and New South Wales. 1 The wide scope of the ad valorem  tariff in South Australia in the 1850s adversely affected the mercantile interests but had

revenue advantages for the government. According to the Collector of Customs in  Victoria, 'if the Victorian tariff were adopted in South Australia there would be a loss  of two-thirds of the customs revenue'.l

Indeed, Victoria had the lowest ratio of customs duties to the value of the  
imports for most of the period after the abolition of the ad valorem tariff in 1852, as  Figure 2-6 shows. With the adoption of the selected tariff system Victorian commercial  conditions for imports became not only the best of the Australian colonies but among  the best in the world. Victorian importers and other traders supplying goods to Victoria  were actually facing the best opportunity they could expect to make profits. The  minimum tariff charges in the period August 1852-December 1854 partly explain the  extraordinary boom of imports in Victoria The increase in duties at the end of 1854  reduced Victoria's advantage in this respect. The remarkable superiority conferred by  the low tariffs was thus diminished, though the advantage in the smaller scope of  application of the tariff remained. The adjusted supply of imports to demand from late

1854 could partly explain the reduced volume of imports in the reminder of the  decade. This state of affairs reduced the interest of the Chamber in the tariff issue after  1855. Even after the changes of Decem ber 1854 the Victorian tariff remained one of the  most favourable in the world towards the commercial interests, the importers in  particular. 1 It is clear why the mercantile community fought to maintain the selected  tariff and to oppose the re-introduction of ad valorem duties.  
The relatively shorter time needed to assess imports and the relatively lower rates  of tariff duty meant that in Victoria importing had lower transaction costs than the other  colonies. The larger the transaction costs, the more likely it is that equilibrium is at the  no-trade point. This principle partly explains why a large amount of imports entered  Victoria in the 1850s, particularly in the period before the end of 1854.  
Conclusion  
This chapter has re-estimated many of the import statistics for Victoria in the  1850s. After the gold discoveries Victoria depended on imports to a even greater extent  than in earlier periods. The new estimates of net imports per head in constant prices has  shown the real impact of imports on individual demand and the fluctuations of imports in  a more accurate manner than ever before. In comparison with the 1840s and the first few  years of the 1860s, the proportions of the two major categories of imports - capital  goods and consumer goods did not undergo substantial change in the 1850s, but the  composition of the sub-groups within these two categories changed noticeably,  suggesting a change in demand and the development of some local industries. It has also  been argued that the advantageous nature of the Victorian tariff from 1852 to the end of  1854 compared with the tariff systems in other colonies was a factor favouring the entry  of a large amount of imports in that period.

It is very different in other countries' . VOles and  proceeding s, 1859-60, vol. 2, no. D .26.
