Chapter 5  
The Prices of Imports and Transport in the Victorian Interior  
Introduction  
Chapters 3 and 4 have traced the ways in which imports were organized and their  initial distribution at auction after being landed. Moreover, most imports still had to fmd  their way into the interior for, as Chapter 1 has shown, that is where most consumers  came to be located after the gold discoveries. This lengthened the train of transactions  and counteracted the speedy feedback of market information that was gained through the  initial disposal of imports by auction. It has not been possible, because of the limited  availability of appropriate source material, to follow the progress of imports along the  distribution chain until they emerged through retail outlets into the hands of final  consumers. It has been possible, however, make considerable headway in the study of  one important aspect of this process. A fundamental indication of the organizational and  economic problems that had to be overcome in the distribution of goods inland was the  gap between prices in the interior and on the coast. This chapter studies in detail the  changing price differential between Melbourne and the main centres of consumption in  the interior.  
Though most of the demand for imports in the 1850s was from the interior,  almost all imports that entered the colony were distributed initially through the seaports.  The market situation in the seaports, predominantly in Melbourne, was determined by  the relationship between the supply and demand for imports both in the ports themselves  but also in the colony as a whole. The proportion of the population in the interior was  about 50 per cent at the beginning of 1851 and increased to 55 per cent in 1854, and  then to 67 per cent in 1857 and again to 72 per cent in 1861. Almost all the food stuffs  and other goods for daily use on the goldfields had to be carried from the seaports. The  prices of imported goods were much higher in the interior than those in the coastal  areas. To an extent, this reflected transport costs that in turn consisted mainly of labour 
210  
costs. Other influences included government efforts at improving land communication,  and a variety of transaction costs involved in the disposal of goods into the interior.  
The discussion of this chapter is arranged into six sections. The first is an  examination of the existing literature, focusing on the contributions of Coghlan, Butlin  and Blainey, the most influential commentators. This discussion suggests that the  establishment of price data is a necessary starting point for further research. The second  section explains the reasons for comparing prices in Bendigo and Melbourne as a case  study, as well as the limitations of using these data. The third section tries to explain the  first and most significant feature of the structure of prices: the high price level before  1854 in the interior and the general trend of gradual decline thereafter. This is  approached through an examination of the private sector's handling of the demand of an  increasing population and the level of return to labour. The fourth section of the chapter  discusses the public sector's handling of improvements to land communications. The  fifth analyses the relationship between the cost of transport and the trend of prices, and  also the complicating factors arising from the commercial situation of a general trend of  declining prices and wet seasons. The final section discusses the implications of prices  in the interior for an understanding of the demand for and supply of imports.  
The arguments developed in this chapter are based on the investigation of three  sets of data. First, there is information on differences in prices between Melbourne and  the interior, Bendigo being chosen as a representative of the interior. Second, the cost of  transport from Melbourne to the interior is analysed, using data on cartage rates from  Melbourne to various destinations in the interior, covering the period from 4 July 1853,  the earliest date available, to 1859, and also on wage rates in the transport industry.  Finally, there is a analysis of the results of the government's effort to improve land  communications. This makes use of statistics on expenditure on roads and bridges from  reports and returns of the Victorian Central Road Board.

Existing studies  
The high prices in inland Victorian and the action taken to lower them were  among the most outstanding features of the latter part of the decade. Economic  historians have long been concerned with this issue. Many writers, including some  contemporaries, have realized that transport difficulties were an important cause of high  prices in the interior. 1 Coghlan, Blainey and Butlin have been the most influential  commentators on this issue, so their treatment of the topic will be the starting point of  the discussion in this chapter.  
When Coghlan commented on the high prices on the Victorian goldfields, he  regarded the state of the roads as the principal factor resulting in the high cost of  transport that was added to prices. Thus he said that 'in the years 1851 and 1852 proper  roads did not exist in Victoria, and teams proceeding from Melbourne to the goldfields  of Ballarat and Mount Alexander had often the greatest difficulty in making their way to  their destination. This was especially the case in winter'.2 He also thought that the  improvement of the poor roads led to a reduction of the cost of transport. He  commented that 'the Victorian Government was fully alive to the need for good  communication with the diggings, and owning to the construction of serviceable roads  the cost of carriage was sensibly diminished during the opening months of 1853,  although communication by road was still liable to interruption and delay through  seasonal causes'. He continued: 'in 1854 and 1855 the roads to the diggings were very  much better than they had been; during the winter of 1855 carriage from Melbourne to  Mount Alexander did not rise above £ 16 per ton, and to the Ovens district it was not  more than from £25 to £45, according to the description of goods carried'. His stress on  the significance of state of communications for prices in the interior is also found in his  comment on the implications of railways opening traffic to the interior. He said: 'the  
1 For example, Pollard, a contemporary writer, wrote an essay on internal communication, The Prize  Essay on Internal Communication; Baker examined the mail routes in the Port Phillip district in the  1830s and the 1840s, 'Early Mail Communication in YiclOria', pp. 108-16; Morris discussed the  transport on the Murray River, 'River Transport on the Greater Murray Network', pp. 78-88. Bach  examined the sea route between Sydney and Melbourne mainly in the first half of the 1850s, 'Sea  Communications between Sydney and Melbourne before 1860', pp. 1-22.

212  
opening of the railways in 1859 had a very favourable effect upon prices at the  goldfields, which were quickly assimilated to those of Melbourne'.  
The cost of transport and the state of communications were the most useful points  raised by Coghlan in explaining high prices in the interior. He thought that the poor state  of transport was the root cause of high prices, through the cost of transport. In doing so  Coghlan provided many statistics, which formed the original contribution made by  Coghlan to this topic. However, he did not go beyond general remarks into the inter 
relationship between prices, transport cost and the state of communications by providing  systematic data and information.  
Blainey's The Tyranny of Distance is a study of aspects of transport inside and  outside Australia. The purpose of his book is to deal with the effects of distance and  isolation on the formation of Australian history. This broad treatment did not go into  such details as prices and cost of transport in the interior of Victoria. He raised these  questions in relation to his argument that 'in narrating why new countries grew and  flourished it is customary to assign the cause to their poverty or richness in natural  resources. But it is not simply the abundance of resources ... resources lying side by  side are usually far more valuable than if they are parted by long distances ... mineral  deposits lying near human settlement are likely to be discovered long before minerals  that lie far from a hut or road'.3 So far as interior communication of Victoria after the  gold discoveries is concerned, Blainey was of the opinion that 'the main hindrance to  the mining of gold was the cost of inland transport', which raised living costs on the  goldfields: 'nearly everything they bought was expensive because it came from Europe.  The cost of carrying those goods across the globe, however, was much less than the  cost of carrying them from the nearest Australian seaport to the goldfields'. As to the  cause of the high cost of transport, he said, The cost of carrying supplies was inflated  by the scarcity of labour, for teamsters demanded high wages, and farriers and  wheelwrights and blacksmiths earned as much as many gentlemen-farmers earned in  England.' Moreover, he also advanced the seasonal problems of transport to the

213  
interior, 'The bush tracks to the goldfields had steep hills and unbridged creeks and in  winter they were boggy or impassable',  
In regard to prices, the cost of transport and the state of communications, Blainey  did not go further than Coghlan. However, his contribution lies in that he stated clearly  that the cost of transport was inflated by high wages that were due to the scarcity of  labour. It appears that, in this sense, he stressed the cost of labour rather than the  condition of communications, which was more responsible for the cost of transport and  the high prices in the interior.  
In a macro approach Butlin treated the state of communications in the 1840s and  the 1850s in the Australian colonies as a background to the necessity for large  investments in transport after the 1870s. So far as communications to the interior are  concerned, he thought 'serious transport problems' had occurred in the 1 840s due to the  rapid expansion of pastoral settlement and the extending of lines of communication over  which wool exports were carried to ports. He noted that 'long delays in the supply of  goods to spreading inland settlements provoked widespread complaint' .. 4 Hence the  initiative by private enterprise to improve the transport conditions by building railways.  The influx of people attracted by the gold discoveries, according to B utlin, 'created a  transport crisis and, for a time, changed the character of the communication problem',  The 'crisis' meant the high freight costs and the long delays in getting goods to the  goldfields, As Butlin said, 'So poor were the overland communications in Victoria that  it was estimated that freight charges between Melbourne and the goldfields generally  equalled the base, Melbourne, price of most commodities and that delays of weeks  might occur in struggling with drays along the hundred or so miles of bush tracks  between Melbourne and the diggings'. Faced with this crisis, as Butlin has pointed out,  'the newly formed government of Victoria [which] was not prepared for the crisis into  which it was cast almost immediatel y after birth. From a mere £ 11,113 road outlay in  1851, Victorian government road expenditure sky-rocketed to an annual outlay of  £520,078 in 1853. Roads were fOlmed from Melbourne to Sandhurst (Bendigo), from

Geelong to Ballarat. from the minor southern ports of Belfast and Portland. hopefully  starting northwards, and around the area of the goldfields. By 1853. 132 miles, by  1858,341 miles of new road appeared to be transfonning the Victorian wideness.'  
Then Butlin turned to railways. the more effective means of transport. He pointed  out that due to technical difficulties. increased traffic and the growing size and loads of  the hard-wheeled drays. the rapid rate of depreciation and the wear and tear of the roads  accelerated, and 'by 1854, it had become "imperatively necessary" to deal with the  inefficiency, cost, long delays, loses and wastes of animal transport on ordinary roads  and to accept the task of replacing main roads with railways to connect the main ports  and interior settlements'. In these circumstances the Victorian government was 'under  much more direct and urgent pressure to establish orderly and effective transport to the  large new settlement'. So, 'railway development, as the centre of communications  investment, was accepted by the colonial governments by the mid-fifties ... Roads carne  to be regarded as branch lines, although, for the time being, some main road  construction remained necessary . Around this general conception of internal  communication. the colonial governments were occupied, for the next three years  [1857-1859], with preparation ... By 1857-58. the groundwork had been laid. to pennit  substantial action in the growth of communications facilities. But by the time this was  being done, the character of the transport problem was altering.'  
Butlin's description has many useful points: the appearance of the transport crisis  in the interior after the gold discoveries. high price, the high cost of freight and the long  delay, the limited significance of improved roads leading to the adoption of railways as  the most effective means of communication. However, Butlin did not describe in detail  the manifestations of the 'crisis' and how it changed throughout the decade. He did not  indicate the implications of this 'crisis' for demand for and supply of goods in the  interior. He also did not assess the extent to which the improvement of the roads had  lessening the 'crisis' before he stressed the importance of railways.  
The examination above shows that the existing literature has made a useful start  in the study of this subject in clearly identifying three interrelated elements: the high 
215  
prices, the high cost of transport. and the state of communications. However, there are  also two shortcomings in the literature. One is the lack of a systematic study of the  relationship between these elements. The second is the lack of emphasis on significant  factors such as labour costs in the transport industry. wet seasons and fluctuations in  goods supply.  
The above examination of the literature suggests that price will be the crucial  question to the investigation of this chapter. The following section starts with an  establishment of a price series for the interior.  
Bendigo prices-a case study  
The statement that prices in the interior were higher than those in the coastal area  is based on a systematic comparison of prices in Melbourne and in the interior. The  wholesale price data for Melbourne (for details see Appendix 6-3) will be used here as  the basis for comparison. A series representing the movement of prices in the interior  will also be established here.  
In the period of more than ten years prior to the gold discoveries in 1851, there  was not a market in a proper sense in the interior. nor a typical series of prices in areas  other than the principal seaport towns like Melbourne and Geelong. The population was  scattered, many pastoralists organized their own supplies of goods. and the prices in the  stores differed from time to time and from place to place. However. one thing is certain.  the prices in the vast interior were much higher than those in the seaports due to the cost  of transportation.  
The areas where the principal gold discoveries occurred had proved to be the  places where relatively high production of gold was maintained throughout the decade.  Diggers and their dependents were concentrated in these areas. as were others who  provided for the needs of the diggers. Geographically. there were two principal  concentrations of population. One was in the triangular area bounded by Ballarat.  Bendigo and Ararat in western Victoria. The other was the area around Ovens in the east  of the colony. However, in terms of population density. about 90 per cent of miners 
216  
were in the triangular area throughout the decade.5 The enormous increase and  concentration of population in these areas made possible the appearance and  development of various types of markets. Within the first few years after the gold  discoveries goods markets already existed in Bendigo, Castlemaine, Ballarat and Ovens;  later in 1854 markets were also established in Maryborough and Ararat. 6  
For the purpose of this chapter, it is not necessary to examine all the existing  series of prices in the interior. So prices in Bendigo have been chosen as a case study in  order to indicate some features of price movement in the interior. The price data are  more complete for Bendigo than for other places. There are three sources of the prices in  the interior: the Victorian Goldfields Commissioners' reports, the Argus and local  newspapers. The availahle Commissioners' reports on prices are very few and  incomplete. They cover only six months of 1853, five months of 1854, and one month  in 1855. The Argus provides some sketchy information about prices on the principal  goldfields, and the Bendigo market is mentioned on more occasions than others. So the  main source of price data is the local newspapers published in goldfield towns. The  available run of the Bendigo Advertiser covers a longer period than those of other  newspapers such as the Ballarat Advertiser, the Castlemain e Advertiser, the Ararat  Advertiser and the Ovens and Murray Advertiser.  
Prices in the Bendigo market are likely to give a good indication of the general  level of prices in the interior. Since payable gold was first discovered in July-August  1851, Bendigo had been one of the principal and most densely populated goldfields.  The proportion of the population engaged in mining was about 20-40 per cent in 1853.1  Production of gold in Bendigo was also substantial. However, Mount Alexander and  Bendigo were always regarded as one area, and the production of gold in both areas  was on many occasions regarded as a single statistic. For example, 70,855 ounces were  brought to Melbourne from this total area by the government escort in the period from  
5 Victoria, Census, 1854. 1857 and 1860.  
6 This impression is derived from commercial information on the newly established newspapers in the  principal goldfields such as the Casflemaine Advertiser. the Ballarat Times, the Ararat Advertiser, the  Ovens and the Murray Advertiser.

217  
18 November to 27 December 1852, which represented about 47 per cent of all gold  brought by the escort in the same period. 8 From Bendigo alone 451,582 ounces were  received by escort in 1855, about 25 per cent of the total amount brought by the escort.  Bendigo is so close to Castlemaine that the two big goldfields could be regarded as a  single large interior market. The Commissioners' reports show that there was no  difference of any significance in nearly all prices between the goldfields in western  Victoria including Castlemaine, Sandhurst, Ballarat and Maryborough.9 Ovens was an  exception because goods were mainly supplied by traders from Sydney. But the prices  there on most occasions were higher than those in the principal goldfields in the western  area due to the greater distance to goods transport. At any rate, prices in Bendigo would  largely indicate the movement of prices in the goldfields in Western Victoria.  
So far as prices in Bendigo are concerned, however, the data is much less  complete than in Melbourne. The price series for Bendigo has to be collected from two  sources. One is from Argus, covering most of 1853 and 1854; the other is from the  Bendigo Advertiser, covering the period from 1855 to 1859. The actual prices are set  out in Appendix 5-2. For comparison, eleven items that accounted for a large share of  the total consumption and that are comparable with those of Melbourne in quantity have  been chosen,  
The prices of these items are comparable with those in Melbourne because they  are believed to be wholesale prices. The prices for Melbourne are undoubtedly current  wholesale prices, as will be explained in Chapter 6. The prices for Bendigo in the period  from September 1854 to June 1859 were taken from three sources in the Bendigo  Advertiser. In 1854 and the first five months and from September to December in  1855, and the period from September 1856 to 1859 a comprehensive wholesale price  list was regularly provided by the Advertiser under the title 'Bendigo wholesale prices  current' or 'Sandhurst wholesale prices current'. In the period from June to August  1855 and March, May and August 1856 prices are taken from the firms of auctioneers,

S. Jones and L. Macpherson and Co. The prices provided by the auctioneers are also  believed to be wholesale prices at auction. The prices that are deri ved from the Argus in  most of 1853 and in the first eight months of 1854 were published by the two above  mentioned auctioneers under the title 'Bendigo Market'. This suggests that these prices  were also wholesale prices. A further reason for believing these to be wholesale prices  is that the prices of Bendigo from the above sources were usually about 30 per cent  lower than the prices in the Commissioners' reports that were apparently retail prices  (Appendix 5-1).

The features of Bendigo prices in comparison with those of Melbourne have been  summarized below.  
Of the eleven items to be compared, Seven items are particularly dealt with  because more information about them is available for Bendigo. These goods are butter,  cheese, flour, coffee, tea, sugar and salt, and they are believed to be largely imports  from outside the colony. The pIices of these items are presented in the form of ratios in  Figures 5-1 to 5-5, in which the current price of the corresponding item in Melbourne is 
219  
treated as 100 regardless of the fluctuation in the level of prices in Melbourne itself. The  actual prices in Bendigo on which the ratios are calculated are attached as Appendix 5-2.

The most remarkable phenomenon shown in these Figures is that all these prices  were particularly high in 1853 and 1854. much above the price level in Melbourne. and 
220  
these prices shared a common trend, in varying degrees, a gradual decline from mid 1854 to mid-1859 in comparison with the prices in Melbourne. Most of these  commodities show this trend clearly, as in the case of cheese, coffee, salt, flour, sugar,  and tea. The trend is less marked in the case of butter. If the fact that prices in  Melbourne underwent a remarkahle decline throughout this period (as will be discussed  in Chapter 7), is taken into account, the decline of the prices in Bendigo was even faster  and sharper. The high price level before 1854 and the broad trend of gradual decline  thereafter suggest the existence of factors reducing the cost of transport. These factors  will be dealt with in Sections 3 and 4. The high price level before 1853 in Bendigo is  not shown in Figures 5-1 to 5-5 which start from mid-I853. So there is a gap of about  one year and a half between the rich gold discoveries and the date from which these  figures start. The evidence of high prices in Bendigo in the period before mid-1853 will  also be provided in Section 3.

There were short-run variations around the trend of decline in prices in Bendigo.  These variations were principally related to two circumstances. One is fluctuations in  imports. Figures 5-1 to 5-5 show that the last months of 1854 form a turning point, 

221  
with prices higher before that point than after. Prices, with exception of cheese,  increased noticeably in 1856-1857 against the general trend of slow decline. These  phenomena suggest a relationship between prices in Bendigo and the fluctuations in the  imports to the colony. Another is the effect of wet seasons which mainly cover the  period from May to September when the rainfall is generally 20 per cent higher than the  other months. Throughout the 1850s, these factors significantly complicated the  situation in a way which sometimes makes it difficult to discern longer-run trends.  Figures 5-1 to 5-5 show that the prices of coffee, sugar, flour in 1853, 1854 and 1855,  butter and tea in 1853, 1854 and 1856 were influenced apparently by wet seasons. The  effects of fluctuations in imports and the wet seasons will be examined in Section 5.

The formation and the changing margin in prices between the interior and  seaports were due to effects from both the private sector and public sector. There were  elements from the private sector which tended to enlarge or maintain the gap, whereas  the efforts of the public sector always aimed at reducing the gap. The effects from the  two sectors are dealt with in the next two sections. 
222  
The negative effects of private sector on prices in the interior  
When the level of prices in the interior is examined, it is found that the gap in  prices between Bendigo and Melbourne was particularly wide before mid-1854, and this  gap, although became smaller, existed over the remainder of the decade. When the  causes of this gap are considered, two reasons are found. These were the increasing size  of the population in the interior and labour costs particularly in the transport industry.  
The huge demand for imported goods formed the real basis for high prices in the  interior. The payable gold discoveries attracted a large and constant inflow of  immigrants into the colony, and more than half of them went to the goldfields. So in  interior which had previously been dotted with pastoral stations and a small number of  pastoralists and shepherds was flooded by waves of gold-seekers. According to the  Commissioners' reports on population, the proportion of adult males in the total  population on the goldfields ranged between 66 and 71 per cent in the period from July  to December 1854. These shares that are averaged by twelve months are 67, 69 and 61  per cent in 1855, 1856 and 1857 respectively.lO (For details see Appendix 5-3) This  shows a trend of progressive decline. Taking this trend into account, it is assumed that  the proportions of adult male would be 80 per cent in 1852 and 75 per cent in 1853. If  the remaining part of population that are estimated from the assumed proportions are  added to Serle's figures of adult males, the total population of the Victorian goldfields  would be around 30,000 in early 1852 and would increase to about 50,000 at the end of  that year. Similarly, the total population is estimated to have increased from about  60,000 at the beginning of 1853 to about 82,000 in the last months of that year. I I  
Population then grew progressively to reach 115,000 in July-August 1854, as shown in  Figure 5-6. The census of 1854 showed that by March of that year the population in the  interior was more than half the total population in the colony, or, nearly double the total  population of the colony in 1851 on the eve of the gold discoveries.

work force, the diggers were also consumers. The growth of population in the interior  created demand that had to be met by a corresponding growth in supply.

Labour costs were an important element in the high cost of transport that made  prices in the interior much higher than those in Melbourne. Places where rich gold was  found such as Ballarat, Bendigo, Castlemaine, Heathcote, CIunes were about 75-100  miles from Melbourne. J3 At that time, travelling such a distance posed tremendous  difficulties (this will be discussed later). The bullock teams that were the principal  means of transport to the interior usually took two or three weeks or even longer, for a  return trip from these diggings to Melbourne in the period before 1854. The cost of  transport consisted of the wages of the drivers, maintenance of equipment and food for  the bullocks. This cost added to the prices in the interior. The longer a trip took, the  higher the cost would be. In this sense, the condition of land communications was  important. So far as the costs of transport are concerned, they depended largely on the  wage rates and on the cost of maintenance of equipment. Since it is nearly impossible to

224  
estimate these maintenance costs, only the wage rates of the carrying industry are dealt  with here. 14

Figure 5-7 shows that labour cost in the carrying industry was a substantial cause  dictating movements in cartage rates (representing total cost of transpon), particularly in  the period from late 1854 to the end of the decade. Figure 5-7 also shows that the  dictating role of the labour cost was disturbed greatl y in the wet seasons in 1853 and  1854, and this disturbance was much reduced in 1855 and 1856, and was absent after  1857. These facts suggest a sharp decline in the length of transport delays in wet  seasons while the state of roads was improving. The wage rates in the carrying industry  represented the general level of earnings in the Victorian labour market that largely  depended on the average returns of gold digging and supply of labour. The estimates of  gold return per adult male in Chapter 7 have shown that diggers' incomes in 1852 and  1853 were very high, and that this together with a lack of labourers, raised wage rates.

Figures 7-7 to 7-12 in Chapter 7 show that the high wages rates of nearly all  occupations in Melbourne continued till October-November 1854. The general high cost  of labour in the first two to three years of the gold discoveries maintained the high cost  of transport in the interior.  
In these circumstances the gap in prices between Bendigo and Melbourne was  striking throughout the 1850s. Figures 5-1 to 5-3 and 5-5 show that in the period before  mid-1853 the prices in Bendigo were extremely high. with the prices of some goods.  such as flour. sugar. coffee. being triple the price in Melbourne. However. these figures  start from mid-1853. One might ask whether prices in Bendigo before mid-1853 were  similar to those of 1853-1854. The answer here is positive. The discussion of the  private sector above has indicated the reasons for higher prices in the interior. In  addition, some comments by Westgarth and Coghlan provide further evidence. In  commenting on the effects of the high cost of transport on prices in Bendigo in mid 
1852 Westgarth said: '£1 per ton per mile and upwards were the rates of carriage of the  day [in the Winter of 1852]. The local dealer must have his profits as well as the carrier,  so that a ton of flour. which cost £25 at Melbourne. had risen to £200 ere it reached the  hungry consumer at Bendigo.'ls According to Coghlan. in May and June 1852 in  Castlemaine. the prices of sugar were estimated at £75-£150 per ton and salt at £80- 
£170 per ton. whereas at the same time the price of sugar was £27 and of dairy salt (the  best kind of salt) was £6-8 per ton in Melbourne. 16 The differences in price of lighter  goods were. of course. not as high as those of the heavy goods. For instance. the  Commissioners' reports suggest that early in 1853 the price of coffee in Bendigo was  twice that in Mel bourne. 17  
Population growth and wage rates in private sector continued to keep prices  significantly high after 1855. On the one hand. the high rate of growth of population in  the goldfields was maintained (as shown in Figure 5- 6) despite the sharp decline in the  average return on gold. The growth rate of population in the interior was much higher

226  
than that in the seaports, as has been shown in Part One. The rapid growth of  population hindered the reduction in prices in two ways. First, the extent of demand  itself discouraged a decline in prices. Prices in the seaports declined sharply from late  1854 and this lower level was maintained till the end of the decade. However, the gap in  the prices of some goods in the interior became even higher, as shown in Figures 5-3  and 5-5 (coffee, cheese and butter). Coghlan thought that a rapid growth in population  might have prevented prices from declining: 'residents on the goldfields had not the  advantage in lower prices that might have been expected, mainly because the increase of  people on the fields was faster than the ability of the storekeepers to supply them with  goodS'.18 Second, the increasing demand discouraged a decline in transport costs. This  meant that the roads were used more frequently and consequently the wear and tear on  the roads was greatly accelerated. The result of improvements to the roads was thus  significantly reduced and the efficiency of vehicles was adversely effected and delays  resulted.  
On the other hand, the state of general labour costs was also a factor preventing  prices in the interior being reduced to a level closer to those in Melbourne. From late  1854 prices and wage rates in the Victorian market declined significantly. The constant  efforts and large investments by the government on the improvement of land  communications had also largely increased the efficiency of land transport. In these  circumstances, the general price level, as shown in Figures 5-1 to 5-5, declined to an  lower level in absolute terms. However, the difference of prices between Melbourne and  the interior, despite being largely reduced, remained considerable for the rest of the  decade. This state of affairs might be explained by the fact that labour costs and the  other costs involved in transport were maintained by the general level of labour costs  and prices in the Victorian market. This is why the cartage level did not undergo further  reductions of any substance between 1855 and the end of the decade. Cartage costs  were mainly responsible for the higher prices in the interior during this period.  
18 Coghlan, Labour and Induslr), in Auslralia, pp. 817-18. 
227  
The determining role of general labour costs in maintaining the level of cartage  can be seen in the following cases. The usual case was like this: if the carriers could  earn the general rate current in the labour market, then the cost of cartage would have to  been maintained at a certain level. However, when the cartage rate was lower than the  level at which the carriers' return was below the general rate in the labour market, then  the carriers more often than not would turn their teams to other pursuits. This occurred  occasionally from the mid-1850. Such a situation in the winter of 1855 was described  thus: 'so many of the draymen have during the last few days turned out their cattle in  preference to working for wages which, in many cases, fall far short of paying even for  their horsefeed, that already some little difficulty is experienced in readily procuring  means of conveyance'. 19  
Such situations occurred more frequently from 1857. It usually started with low  cartage costs and high prices for transport equipment. Some cases reported in the Argus  in the mid-I857 revealed this state of affairs: 'the present low prices will induce many  owners of teams to take them off the roads' . A fortnight later: 'owing to ruling [low]  rates of cartage and high prices of horse feed ... several teamsters have taken their cattle  off the roads'. One month later, due to the continuing low rate of cartage: 'a large  number of teamsters having (in consequence of the unremunerative prices that have been  ruling during last month) refused to take loading, and turned their horses into  paddocks'. Moreover, the cartage rate was also affected by some other circumstances.  One example in mid-1858, when the great demand for vehicles to transport building  materials of railways engaged a great number of bullock learns, few bullock learns were  available to transport other goods. Consequently, 'the supply of teams has not been  quite equal to the demand and that rates have consequently ruled higher' .20 Such  situations became common in regulating the rate of cartage in the last years of the  decade. This explains in part why relatively high prices continued till the end of the  decade.

The public sector and prices in the interior  
The government could do little to reduce the cost of transport through intervening  directly. It could not, for instance, determine the immigrant inflow or the level of wage  rates or other types of individual income simply to influence prices in the interior.  Therefore, the actual role of the Government in reducing the cost of transport and hence  prices in the interior was limited to efficiency of the land carriage by investing in  improvements to land communications.  
The chief feature of the physical geography of Victoria is the absence of  navigabl e rive rs and the conseq uent deficiency in the means of internal  communications.21 This feature dictates that internal communications would be mainly  carried out by land. In the early years of settlement there were no roads in the virgin  land. Bush tracks used only by wandering Aborigines or explorers formed the only  mode of land communication. While the pastoral industry was developing rapidly in  later 1830s and 1840s the demand for hetter means of delivering wool to the seaports  and of bringing goods and mail to the interior encouraged the initial choice and opening  of routes.  
The principal routes covering most of the colony, including the western gold  area, were opened to traffic before gold. Melbourne and, to a much lesser extent,  Geelong, which served as commercial distribution and administrative centres, were also  the centres of the communications system of the whole colony. There were several main  routes spreading from Melbourne which were established before gold. These roads ran  from Melbourne to Sydney, Melb ourne to Geelong, Geelong to Portland and  Warrnambool, to Mt Macedon via Mt Alexander, and to Alberton. The first principal  inland route in the Port Phillip Distric t was the so called 'overland' to Sydney. It was  already in use by 1837 and carried a mai l service early in 1838. Kilmore, Seymour,  Broken River (Benalla), and Ovens, whi ch became an important gold diggings in the  1850s, were on the 'overl and' route to Sydney. The road from Geelong to Portland and  Warrnambool were already in common use in early 1840s. The route from Melbourne  
21 White desclibed this feature in detail, MaSTering Risk, pp. 74-77. 

229  
via Mt Alexander to Mt Macedon was open to traffic no later than 1848. The Melbourne  to Alberton road was used officially by the mail no later than 1848.22 Three of these  routes would be important to later gold diggings and led to or passed by such important  diggings as Castlemaine, Bendigo, Ovens and (half way) to Ballarat. These routes were  Melbourne to Mount Macedon, Melbourne to Sydney, and Melbourne to Geelong.  
However, these routes were no better than bush tracks at this stage. According to  
Coghlan: 'in the years 1851 and 1852 proper roads did not exist in Victoria'.23 Butlin  also commented that: 'hardly any road development had been attempted in Port  Phillip'.24 This was due mainly to two causes. First, the commercial demand from a  small and scattered population in the interior was limited. According to the Victorian  censuses, the population grew from 11,738 in 1841 to 77,345 in 1851.25 The  population of Melbourne and Geelong was somewhere between 44 per cent and 50 per  cent of the total population of the District, and that of Bourke and Grant counties  (excluding their port towns) was 27 to 30 per cent. This pattern of population  distribution reveals that about 70 to 80 per cent of the population was concentrated in a  small areas around Hobson's Bay comprising 3.7 per cent of the whole territory.26  With the exception of the part of population who lived outside this small area but still  close to Melbourne or Geelong, the size of the population that lived in the area of what  was to become the goldfields or heyond was estimated to he not more than 10,000 on  the eve of the gold discoveries, although by 1848 three-fourths of the whole interior  was occupied by squatters or pastoralists under squatters' licences. This part of the  population comprised squatters, itinerant drovers, shearers, and labourers as well as  farmers, shepherds and stockmen. These people formed the basic consumers in the  interior. So, the use of these roads was limited to the wool industry and the commercial  and mail needs of the small population in the interior. The seasonal requirements of the

230  
pastoral industry and the fact that the surface of the roads was finn for only part of the  year also limited the frequency with which these roads were used.  
Second, little was spent on road improvement. According to the Report from the  
Select Committee on Roads and Bridges in November 1852, the territorial revenue from  the settlement of the Colony to the 30th June 1851 had produced a gross amount of  about £1 million, while the total amount spent on roads, streets, and building generally  up to the end of 1848 was less than £37,000, nearly £20,000 of which was expended  on the Prince's Bridge.27  
Most of this limited expenditure on land communications was used to erect  
bridges. The requirement for the upkeep of these roads was not improvement of the  surface, but to make sure they were passable. The Report was of the opinion that 'the  worst feature in the present state of our thoroughfares is the want of a sufficient number  of bridges, when roads are required, as in the interior chiefly, for the annual transport of  wool to the market, or the driving of cattle'.28 Consequently, as the Report also shows,  of £20,884 actual expenditure on roads and bridges in the period 1 st 1849 to  1st October 1851, £14,843 (more than 70 per cent) went to erecting bridges.29 So little  was spent on improving the surface of the roads. In short, limited commercial demand  from the interior owing to the mode of population distribution and the limited use of the  roads for annual wool transport as well as the small financial input limited the  improvement of roads in this period.  
When the golden age suddenly befell the Colony, the state of the existing roads,  
representing the capacity of land transport, presented a tremendous challenge. The  enonnous increase in population and the implications of this for demand in the interior  have been mentioned in the previous section. The demand for goods supply in the  interior increased extraordinalily; the demand for transport of goods and people to the  interior became heavier and more frequent. The existing state of land communications  could not cope with this increased demand. The disparity between the state of land

231  
communications and the demand in the interior was reflected in a rise in the cost of  transport and delays in the delivery of goods. The increased cost of transport was  naturally added to prices. The delays were caused in tum by the unimproved state of the  roads.  
However, substantial improvements in land communication did not start until  early 1853. The pressure to improve land communications depended on how great the  demand was, and the extent of real improvement was decided firstly by the size of  financial inputs. Undoubtedly, the urgent need for better roads to the gold diggings was  strongly felt as soon as the rush started. However, local development, including the  improvement of land communications largely depended on local revenue. The local  revenue, in tum, was dictated by tariffs and land sales. Only when a large amount of  gold was being exported and a large volume of imports entered the colony and large  amounts of land were sold did governments have the opportunity to collect more  revenue to invest in local facilities. For 1851 the revenue increased, but not  substantially, on the base of 1850. Local expenditure in that year was £211,811,30 and  the expenditure on forming and repairing roads and bridges was £9,10 I, representing  less than 4 per cent in total expenditure)l Moreover, not all the expenditure on roads  and bridges was in the interior. In 1852 local revenue increased substantially and,  consequently, the total local expenditure rose up to £1,740,444. However, the amount  spent on roads and bridges was only £ 15,264, of which £ 13,927, or about 90 per cent,  went into building and repairing roads and bridges in the interior.32 Considering the size  of total expenditure, the improvement of land communications was seriously neglected.  This suggests that the level of revenue might not be the only factor dictating the level of  financial input into the improvement of land communications. The Government's  priorities were also important, though this will not be discussed here. Nevertheless,  large-scale improvements to roads and hridges in the interior had hardly started by the

232  
end of 1852, considering the level of expenditure on land communications for the same  purposes in 1850, 1851 and 1852.  
By the end of 1852, the state of the roads from Melbourne and Geelong to the  goldfields had not yet improved significantly. A network of proper roads did not exist,  and in most parts these roads were still no better than bush tracks in their narrowness  and unevenness. The worst thing was that roads of this type became impassable during  the annual wet season. When heavy rain occurred during this season 'the creeks, in all  directions, overflowed, bridges were carried away, and the roads from many parts of  the interior were rendered impassable'.33 The soaring cartage rates and prices referred to  above is partly explained by the effects of poor roads. Moreover, this state of  communications also brought great inconvenience and even danger. A horseman who  had just returned from Mount Alexander in May 1852 described the road as quite  impassable for drays and almost impracticable for pedestrians and equestrians. People in  the interior were occa<;ionally isolated, neither able to leave their stations nor receive any  communications nor even sufficient food. In rare cases, people were drowned.34  
The poorer the state of land communications (the wage rates of the labour market  not being taken into account for the moment), the higher the cost of transport and the  higher the prices would be in the interior. In Victoria in the first years of the 1850s, the  high prices on the goldfields forced customers to limit their demand solely to items  needed for survival. According to Coghlan, 'the staple food amongst the miners even in  1854 was still meat, tea and damper'.35 So, when prices were increasing consumers  would limit their consumption. Consequently, the higher the prices, the smaller the  volume of transaction for the interior. The victims of the high cost of transport were the  final consumers, including gold diggers and pastoral settlers as well as agricultural  workers. Oppressed by the high prices they naturally had a strong desire to reduce the  cost of transport to the interior. So, in latter part of 1852 there was a strong and  unanimous appeal to the Government to pay more attention to improving the roads to the

233  
interior. For example, in July 1852 an article in the Argus expressed the hope that  Government would direct its attention to the mismanagement of roads. The author of the  article, who had requested the repair of the road from Melbourne to Mount Alexander,  suggested that 'leading lines of communication such as the road to Mount Alexander and  Sydney, or from Geelong to Portland and Belfast, should necessarily be under the  control and management of Government'.36  
In these circumstances, a sum of £554,924 was spent in 1853 for construction  and repairs of roads and bridges under the supervision of the Central Road Board. This  sum represented 18 per cent of the total expenditure for 1853, or nearly ten times the  total sum of £56,680 for the same purpose from the first settlement of the colony to the  end of 1852. During the latter period (1852) only about I per cent of total expenditure  was spent on roads and bridges.37 When this comparison is made allowance needs to be  given to the enormous inflation after the gold discoveries. In 1854 an even larger sum,  £731,518, representing over 17 per cent of that year's total expenditure, was spent on  road works including road formed, drained or metalled and cleared, cuttings and  embankments and culverts or bridges built. In the first six months of 1854 £364,456  was spent and a length of 192 miles was im proved. The real sum spent was much larger  than the vote of £500,000 in 1854.38  
The government's financial input was principally limited to three roads leading to  the main goldfields in the western areas that mattered greatly in terms of concentrations  of popUlation, demand for commercial services and gold production throughout the  1850s. The first of these roads ran from Melbourne to Mount Alexander, through  Aitken's Gap and Malmsbury to Castlemaine, including the road from there to Bendigo,  with other branch roads. The second road from Melbourne to Sydney through Kalkallo,  Kilmore, Benalla and Belvoir to the south side of the River Murray near Albury,  including the Beechworth road . The third ran from Melbourne to Geelong to Ballarat,

through Lethbridge, Meredith and Buninyong. According to the Return of Works and  Expenditure in 1853 presented by the Central Road Board, about 80 per cent of the total  expenditure was made on these three roads. Particular attention was paid to the road that  passed through and connected Bendigo, Castlemaine, and Ballarat, the most important  goldfields in the colony in the early 1850s. Of the total expenditure in 1853 about 60 per  cent was spent on this road. Another 15 per cent went on the Sydney road leading to  Ovens. Of the remainder, 8 per cent and 13 per cent respectively were devoted to the  cities of Geelong and Melbourne. For the remaining area, including the Belfast,  Portland, Warrnambool. and Gippsland districts, the total expenditure was only  £1428. 39  
The huge financial input in 1853 and 1854 improved these three roads  
considerably. The length of these principal roads to goldfields was as follows: the road  from Melbourne to Castlemaine was about 80 miles, adding another 20 miles to  Bendigo; the road from Melbourne to Ballarat was about 75 miles; the road from  Melbourne to Ovens was nearly 200 miles.4o In 1853 the total length of roads  constructed, drained, metalled or partly metalled and cleared was about 161 miles, of  which about 112 miles directly led from Melbourne and Geelong to the goldfields. The  112 miles consisted of 66 miles between Melbourne and Mount Alexander, 23 miles  between Melbourne and Ovens, and 23 miles between Geelong and Ballarat. In the first  half of 1854 the total length of roads similarly worked on was about 192 miles, of  which 122 miles was on these roads to the goldfields. The 122 miles included 60 miles  between Melbourne and Mount Alexander, 24 miles between Melbourne and Ovens,  and 38 miles from Geelong to Ballarat.41 According to the length of roads worked on in  1853 and the first half of 1854, it can be estimated that by the end of June 1854 the three  principal roads had been largely improved, but to different degrees. With regard to the  road from Melbourne to Castl emaine, Bendigo and even Ballarat nearly all parts of this  road had been worked on in different ways and its condition was largely improved. The

road from Geelong to Ballarat had also been improved remarkably, but to a lesser  degree. In comparison with the first two, the road from Melbourne to Ovens had been  improved to the least degree. The improved length was at most equal to one fourth of  the total length of roads worked on.  
Accordingly, inland communications were largely improved in 1853 and 1854.  An article in the Argus, commenting on the improvements by October 1853, said that 'it  is fair to notice the extensive improvements which are being made on this important  highway [Mount Alexander road]. Within the last few months great changes for the  better have taken place. Creeks, formerl y almost impassable, have been bridged, and  drays now roll over good macadami zed roads ... formerl y they were nightmares for  carriers.'42

In the period from 1855 to the end of the decade the Victorian government  
continued its efforts to improve the condition of land transport so as to increase  efficiency of the vehicles and reduce prices in the interior. Two features of the financial  input enabled the further improvement. Firstly, large amounts were invested each year  in this period. In 1855, according to a return of works and expenditure by the Central  Road Board, a sum of £230,880 was spent on the roads. 43 In the period from January  1856 to December 1860 a sum of £1 ,439,689 14s 2d was invested,44 and if £244,654  (for 1856) is subtracted from this sum the average input of each year from 1857 to 1860  would be around £300,000. 45 The level of the financial input over this period was  lower than in 1853 and 1854 in current prices. If, however, the much reduced prices  and wage rates are taken into account from late 1854, the result achieved from these  investments should not be much below that in 1853 and 1854. A total of 228 miles of  road was worked on in 1855;46 another 68 1 miles of road was improved to varying  degrees in 1856- 1860.47  
Secondly, emphasis was placed on the better condition of the improved roads and  
on extension of branch. It hal) heen seen th at the financial resources for the improvement  of land communications was put into the main roads leading from Melbourne and  Geelong to the principal goldfields, to the western area in particular in 1853 and 1854.  Even in 1855 this stress was still apparent. For example, of the 228 miles of improved  work undertaken in that year there was about 88 miles of the Mount Alexander road, 32  miles of Sydney road, and 37 miles of the Geelong to Ballarat road.48 This pattern,  however, was chan ged in \856- 1860. It seemed th at in this period th e government  intended to divide its fin ancial resources more evenl y among the different areas and  achieve an comprehe nsive improvement of the wh ole ne twork of inland

In 1855 all the works for  improving roads were performed in the fu·st six months. the statistics on general revenue and expenditure  for the whole of 1855 delivered to LegLiative Council reveals that the IOtal expenditure on road and  bridges under the superint endent of the Road Board was £230,673, showing that there were no works  performed on roads in the later half of 1855.

communications. Figure 5-8 shows the new pattern of financial distribution. Population  growth and the spreading of the settlement after 1855 were apparently considered when  the financial resources were divided. In the previous years improvements consisted  mainly of roads cleared, formed or drained. Nearly all work was performed on existing  rough roads or hush tracks. After several years' investment in improvements on roads,  in particular because of the newly discovered goldfields, such as Maryborough and  Ararat in the western part of the colony, from 1856 the emphasis was placed on  improving the roads which had been initially worked on two or three years before, and  on the formation or extension of new roads. For example, the total length of road work  done in 1856 was about 75.5 miles. However, apart from 23 miles of clearing work on  the road from Melhourne to Dandenong, the length of roads built was 51 miles, of  which 46 miles were in the gold areas.49 The changed pattern of expenditure meant that  areas that were away from the main roads or where new gold discoveries occurred  might be connected by newly estahlished branches or by better roads.  
The principal gold-fields and their vicinities, where most of the population in the  
interior were concentrated were still the areas to which most of the financial input went.  Figure 5-8 shows that investment in the Melhourne and Geelong districts was relatively  high. However, a significant part of this was put into the roads from Melbourne or  Gee10ng to the interior. For example, of the £251,832 spent on the Geelong district in  this period, £131,994 went on the road from Geelong to Ballarat.so  
The efforts of the government to improve land communications were hampered to  
a certain extent by two circumstances. From 1853 the Victorian government continually  invested large sums in the improvement of roads and bridges leading to the interior.  Public works were the leading item of each year's expenditure throughout the remainder  of the decade. Of the total expenditure, an important proportion was spent on  
improvements to roads and hridges, no less than 17 per cent in 1853 and 1854, and  from 1855 to 1860 hetween 8 and 10 per cent of each year's expenditure.s I

Consequently, the state of land communications was greatly improved and this led to  declining cartage rates and prices in the interior. This will be examined in the next  section. However, the quality of the improvements to roads was not always  commensurate with the financial input. So the results of the efforts of the public sector  was not as good as it might have otherwise been. Two circumstances hampered the  efforts of the government.  
One was the largely avoidable mismanagement of the relevant department. The  
construction and repair of roads and bridges in the colony were carried out by the  Central Road Board from the early 1850s. Some works were consigned to sub-road  boards which, in tum, put work out to private tender and then supervised the  performance of the contracts. However, the work was often managed in a careless and  inefficient manner and a large amount of money was wasted. This situation led to many  complaints and these were reflected in a report by a Select Committee appointed to  inquire into the mode of carrying the road works. This report said:  
that a number of expensive bridges and culverts have been built in so  
defective a manner that many of them have already fallen, and have been  
rebuilt, while many are now in a dangerous state, and will require to be  
reconstructed at an early date in order to ensure the safety of the travelling  
public; and this is the more to be regretted, inasmuch as the plans and  
specifications under which they had been let provide for first-class material  
and workmanship, and the high plices paid for them ought to have ensured  
them to be works of great stability ... That while the plans and  
specifications under which some of our main roads have been made provide  
for pitching and metalling of the most expensive and approved character,  
many contracts have been executed in so defective a manner that it would  
be cheaper to re-execute them than keep them in repair. 52  
The other was that the cost of constructing and maintaining roads of a decent  
standard was too high for the government to be able to cover most of the colony. There  were three modes of improvement of land communications: railways, macadamized  roads and plank roads. Each was tried to different extents in the colony throughout the  decade, but because railways and plank roads had many limitations, macadamized roads  found the most widespread use. Railways were too expensive and could not be quickly  constructed. It was estimated by an article in the Argus in 1857 that 'the greatest extent  
52 'Report from the Select Committee on Roads and I3ridges', V&P, 1861-2. vol. 2. no. 055. 


239  
of railway we can expect to get for £5,000,000 will be about 150 miles and five years  will probably elapse before that extent is open'.53 They were also costly to keep in  repair. Moreover, to make such railways pay, they must be fed by many tributary  streams of traffic, and ten miles of improved internal communication needed to be  effected for every mile of railroad laid down. The high cost of constructing railways  also explained why most of the private railway projects failed in Australian colonies in  the first half of the 1850s. In the case of plank roads, this remarkable shortcoming was  described by a report:  
they are cheaper and more quickly constructed than macadamized roads, but  they are slippery and dangerous for cattle, and they do not admit of a horse  exerting his full power. However well adapted the plank is for the wheels, it  never can answer for the horses feet. On a slippery surface a horse, as a  matter of course, never can drag the weight he could if he had firm footing.  Plank roads answer well in America, but there they are formed of soft pine,  on which a horse does not slip as he does on our hardwood. 54  
Therefore, their application was limited to some areas in the vicinities of towns.  Consequently, macadamized roads found the most general use in the 1850s. But high  costs were also involved in making a complete road, including the work of formation,  draining and total metalling before the road reached a decent standard. With regard to the  range of the cost, a return hy the Central Road Board in 1860 reveals that in 1856 the  total cost for making one mile of road on the way to Sydney in Kilmore District was  about £5422, and on the way from Melbourne to Ballarat was about £4391. In 1860 one  mile of road from Deep Creek to Broadmeadows in Gisborne District cost about  £3692.55 Accordingly, it is estimated that a total cost of £3000-5000 was needed to  build one mile of complete road in the latter half of the decade. Here, it should be noted  that in the period to late I R54 almost all the roads in the colony had to be built nearly  from nothing and more often than not it was difficult to see results for initial input of  money. Further, the sharp decline in prices and wage rates did not occur until late  1854. Another fact that also should not he neglected is that a significant part of the  expenditure on improvements to land communications went to blidges. For example, 23  
53 Argus, 16 April 1857, p. 4.  
54 Argus, 16 April 1857, p. 7.

240  
per cent of the total sum of £1439,689 for the period 1856-1860 went on erecting or  maintaining 225 bridges.56 The amount was probably higher in the early years due to  the number of unbridged creeks in boggy areas. If these facts are taken into account, it  is believed that the cost would he doubled or even more for the road of the same quality  and the same length in the period 1852-1854. If the defective works are also taken into  consideration, it is estimated that in 1853 and 1854 the sums expended were probably  enough for no more than 40 miles of complete macadamized road, and the length would  not exceed 40 miles for each year of the latter half of the decade. It is believed,  therefore, that only a part of the total length of improved roads was built completely,  and the vast areas in the interior were connected by branch roads that had not been  improved properly by the end of that decade.  
From figures 5-1 to 5-5 it can be concluded that there were certain factors that  tended to reduce the cost of transport and thus indirectly reduced prices in the interior.  The discussion in Sections 3 and 4 has assumed that these factors were the declining  labour costs and the improvement of land communications by the government.  However, the extent to which this assumption is correct depends on a further  examination of three relationships. This will be done in the next section.  
The effect of cartage rates on prices  
This further exam ination is considered like this: if the responses of these two  factors succeeded in integrating the Bendigo market with the Melbourne market, three  relationships should be found: a decline in the ratio of Bendigo prices to Melbourne  prices, a stabilization of the ratios of Bendigo prices to Melbourne prices, and a decline  in the proportion of the Bendigo prices accounted for by cartage costs.  
Figures 5-1 to 5-5 have shown the general trend of gradual decline of Bendigo  prices. They have also shown the relative stabilization of the ratios of Bendigo prices to  Melbourne prices. So the remaining task is to examine the third relationship-the manner  
56 'Roads and Bridges', V&P , IR60- 1. vol, 2, no. C4 . 
241  
in which the decline of the Bendigo prices was explained by the proportional decline in  the cost of transport. Figures 5-9 to 5-16 show the relationshi p between cartage rates  (£lton) by bullock teams from Melbourne to Bendigo and the difference in prices in  Bendigo and Melbourne. In the comparison of the two curves, a paralled movement in  cartage rates and prices would suggest a decisive role for cartage in raising prices in  Bendigo. If the difference in prices were higher than cartage, this would indicate that  cartage was still a cause contrihuting to raising the price, but that at the same time other  factors would have been at work. If the difference in prices was lower than cartage, this  would suggest that the goods came from places other than Melbourne, or the goods  were still from Melboume but was sold at a loss, or the goods were not moved when  the cartage was higher than the difference in prices.

Figures 5-9 to 5- 16 prescnt a phenomenon com prising all of these possible  
implications. Nevertheless, the rol e of cartage in raising prices must be regarded as the  dominating feature. The prices of flour, sugar, salt and coffee were apparently raised by  the cost of transport. The raised prices of cheese, coffee, brandy and butter might also  be explained as being raised hy cartage to varying degrees, but with other factors at  work. These factors will he commented on in the next section. However, another two 


242  
features shown in these figures tend to complicate the situation. One is that cartage was  higher than the difference in plices of sugar, flour, salt, and butter for shorter or longer  periods during the wet seasons in 1853 and 1854. Cartage was quite close to or even  below the difference in prices around 1855 in all the commodities, but the difference in  price was noticeably higher than cartage around 1857 in the cases of butter, brandy,  candles, sugar, flour and cheeses, as shown in these figures.

The result of  the conve rsion from gall on into ton, however, is simpl y a rough indicator  showing the relationship hetween price of these kind of goods in the interior and  transport COSl.

Price differences during the wet seasons of 1853 and 1854 are particularly  
interesting. If the cost of transport, as has been argued, was the main cause pushing up  prices in the interior, how can the phenomenon of rates heing higher than the difference  in prices be explained? Were goods in Bendigo supplied from other sources? The  majority of goods consumed in the interior were imports supplied from Victorian  seaports, and the western area, where all principal gold-fields were located except  Ovens, were supplied by Melbourne and Geelong to a much lesser extent. Meat was the  only commodity provided hy local suppliers in the first few years after the gold  discoveries, hut in the latter years of the decade they also provided other agricultural  products. The only alternative commercial channel from other sources of supply was the  Murray River. However, this river was not open to traffic from South Australia to the  Victorian goldfields until later 1853, and in the first few years after that only a small  proportion of the goods transported to the Victorian interior came by this route partly  due to navigation on the river heing limited to no more than six months in each year.57  Even in 1857- 1858, when the quantity of goods supplied via the Murray River was  much greater than previous years, William Younghusband, the Chief Secretary of South  
57 Morris, 'The River Transport on Ule Greater Murray Network', pp. 78-80. 

246  
Australia, stated that more than 5,000 tons of cargo had gone to Victoria and New South  Wales. Even if all the 5000 tons of cargoes went to Victoria, which represented only  around 1 per cent of all cargoes entering Victorian ports in that year. 5R  
Then one would ask whether the merchants who supplied goods to the interior  
did so at a loss during the wet seasons. The extremely high cartage in the wet seasons in  the period 1852-1854 did not necessarily mean merchants had to take a lose. The  merchants who supplied light goods had no wonies about losses even when they paid  the high cartage. Only those who supplied heavy goods such as sugar, flour and salt ran  such a risk. Even in this case the merchants dealing in heavy goods more often than not  would try to avoid the high cartage hy suspending or reducing the volume of these  goods during the wet seasons. When the surface of the roads became firm and cartage  was reduced, as it did outside the wet seasons, they could supply as much as was  needed in the interior. Accordingly storekeepers in the interior would co-operate with  merchants in the seaports and would store goods at that time. Coghlan described this  situation: 'at these high rates, of course, only goods urgently needed could be canied,  and the storekeepers endeavoured, so that as they were able, to fill up their stocks  during the seasons of easy travelling, so as to avoid violent oscillations in prices'.59 On  many occasions merchants supplied a wide range of goods, if they mixed loads with a  variety of goods including the heavy items, the possibility of loss would be reduced  substantially. So, the high cartage during the wet seasons mostly was applied to items in  urgent need. On the other hand, hecause consignments of goods to the interior were  smaller, and because of the great difficulties facing carrying teams, many drivers of  bullock teams or horse drays turned to other pursuits during the wet seasons. For  instance, it was reported in May 1854 that 'the difficulty in obtaining drays for the  various diggings still continued, the roads being in different parts almost impassible'.6o  
In these circumstances the fact that canage rates were higher than the difference in prices

247  
between Bendigo and Melhourne would not effect the argument that high prices in the  interior were largely due to the cost of transport.  
Under the effect of the depression in late 1854 the margin between cartage and  
the difference in prices became smaller, and the prices of flour, cheese, salt, butter and  sugar were even lower than the cartage for a short time in 1 R55. This phenomenon  might be explained in two ways: Melhourne merchants who brought goods into interior  may have made a loss, or the storekeepers in the interior may have sold at cut prices  under pressure from the over-supply of imports. It is believed that both factors  contributed to this situation. Chapter 7 will describe the low prices at which Melbourne  merchants sold their goods in the depression. In the situation it was quite possible for  Melbourne merchants to have sent their goods to the interior given that selling prices  were higher than cartage. In fact, Figures 5-9 to 5-16 suggest that the profits of those  merchants who sent goods to the interior were not too bad in the context of the sharp fall  in Melbourne prices and the state of surplus that had been reached. There were,  therefore, many reports like the following one: 'merchandise and stores of all kinds  continue to be forwarded in ahundance to the various diggings'.61  
With regard to the difference in prices being notahly higher than the cartage  
around 1857, I suggest th at this situation was caused by the second boom in imports.  One of the phenomena th at occurred in hooms in the 1850s was an increase in prices  and demand. Demand in the intelior also was even greater due to the continuing growth  of population. So supply did not satisfy the demand in the interior for a short period.  This situation, which favouring profits for merchants, might explain the existence of a  small margin above the cartage. Despite the effects of commercial fluctuations on a few  occasions, the difference be tween cartage rates and the difference in prices moved  within a nalTOW margin, and the close relationship between the two curves are apparent.  
So far this chapter has pointed out the extent to which prices in the interior were  
higher than those on the coast. It has also discussed the different effec ts the private and  public sectors had on pri c s as well as th e inlluence of transport costs. Now the

248  
question is: what was the relationship between the high prices in the interior and the  
demand for and supply of imports?  
The implications of prices in the interior for the demand for and supply of imports  
The discussion starts with the demand side. In the period from the gold  
discoveries to the later months of 1854, high prices in the interior aggravated the surplus  
supply of imports, particularly during the boom of imports by limiting consumption in  
the interior. High prices limited demand to such essential goods as flour, tea, sugar,  
butter and other provisions (these foodstuffs were almost the only items that appeared  
regularly in the information in the Argus relating to the markets in the interior in this  
period) For the same reason, heavy goods such as building materials were also in less  
demand than in the seaports. By 1854 the generally impassable condition of roads  
during the wet seasons had not been fundamentally improved and the amount of  
business in heavy goods transacted was limited or even nil in these seasons. Heavy  
goods were transported to the interior only during dry seasons when the roads became  
firm. Even during the dry seasons, high prices, due to the high cartage, largely limited  
the demand. For example, the wholesale prices on 1 April 1854 showed that for 100  
feet of New Zealand pine the price was £5 16s 7 d in Bendigo, over 300 per cent higher  
than the rate of 25-30s in Melboume.62 In these circumstances, the demand and supply  
of goods other than basic items were reduced in the interior. The quantity of  
consumption per person in the interior was not as great as that in the seaports. This  
meant that consumption by more than half the population of the colony was limited to  
varying degrees. The direct result was that a significant quantity of imports could not be  
transported and sold in the interior, and this aggravated the surplus of goods in the  
seaports in the period of the first boom of imports.  
The largely reduced prices from late 1854 favoured an increase in consumption in  
the interior during the commercial recovery in 1855. Figures 5-1 to 5-5 and Appendixes  
5-1 and 5-2 show that, in comparison with the price level before October 1854, most  
62 Argus, 1 April 1854, p. 4. 


F  
249  
prices were sharply reduced and continued to a large extent at a lower level till the end of  the decade. The reduction in prices was caused hy a fall in the cost of transport that was  in tum due to the reduction in lahour costs and the improvement of roads bridges.  Chapter 7 will have reveal ed that the over-supply of imports in 1853-1854 led to a  commercial recession and considerahly contributed to a commercial depression in 1854.  So an increase in consumption hy diggers and other settlers, who formed the majority of  the population of the colony, helped to reduce the level of over supply in this period and  would have promoted recovery in commerce in 1855.  
There was a noticeable increase in prices in the interior from mid-1856 to mid 1857, as shown in Figures 5-1 to 5-5. When prices increased slightly, the real income  of general labourers on the goldfields in the interior decreased more than that of the  working population in the seaports, as wi ll he discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. Although  there were fewer imports in this peri od than previously both in current and constant  values. as discussed in Chapter 2, th ere was still an over-supply of imports. In these  circumstances the increased plices in the interior affected the consumption of more than  two-thirds of the popul ation of the colony, and aggravated the level of over-supply in  the colony as a whole.  
Late in the decade, the prices or goods in the interior remained a restriction on  consumption of imports. The comparison of the prices of some everyday items in the  first four months in 1860 reveals that the prices of flour, sugar, tea and butter in  Bendigo were about 30-50 per cent, 10-30 per cent and 15 per cent higher than those of  the same items in Melhourne. These rati os were already lower than those in 1857. In the  case of spirits and timher, th e pri ces were 130-160 per cent and over 200 per cent  higher than in and higher than they had been in 1857. So it is believed  that till the end of the 1850s great differences in prices between the distribution centres.  particularly Melbourne and the intelior continued to exist; the high prices in the interior  would remain a restriction to different degrees on consumption. particularly of the heavy  types of imported goods, hy more than 70 per cent of the population of the colony. 

250  
With regard to what were the implications of the prices in the interior for the  
supply of imports to the colony, the profitability of supplying to the interior was a factor  
affecting the level of imports. Figures 5-9 to 5-16 have shown that prices in Bendigo,  
once an allowance for cartage has heen deducted, are on most occasions higher than  
those in Melbourne. This suggesL<; the existence of extra profits after the goods had been  
transported from Melhourne to the inteIior. These figures also indicate the differences in  the margin of profits for varying types of goods. By and large, there was little extra  
profit from the goods that were in great demanded and were heavy as well. Such goods  
as sugar, flour and salt were in this category. As has been said, the prices of these  
goods, as shown in these figures, were even lower than those of Melbourne after  
cartage in the wet seasons in 1853 and 1854, This suggests the difficulty with which  
extra profits from these goods were achieved. This situation improved after 1855. There  
were extra profits from the goods that were consumed in lesser quantities, such as  
cheese, butter and coffee. The margins of extra profits are so obvious that they would  
not be affected by the wet seasons. There would also be extra profits from the goods  
that were not in the category of necessities of life, such as wine and spirits. The extra  
profits from these goods were much higher than other types of goods.  
It is perhaps likely that most of the extra profits went to wholesale distributors in  
Melbourne.63 Before the imports were distrihuted to the interior, the various merchants  
who ordered or brought the imports to Melbourne had made profits at the wholesale  
level in Melbourne. If they further participated in sending goods to the interior and they  
sold these goods at higher pIices than in Melbourne, as in the cases above, they would  
63 There is no data directly showing the size and scope of the participation by merchants from different  
locations in these commercial transactions. The that Melbourne wholesalers made most of  
the profit is based on tJl e pallern of the distribution of businessmen in the colony as a whole. An  
investigation of the pattern of distribution of commercial businesses through Victorian directories  
suggests that merchants in Melbourne were largely responsible for the importaIion and sale of goods to  
the interior. These merchants, as wholcsalers, not only sold goods to the buyers in the seaports, but also  
met the larger demand from the inlerior. Usually, when they received information from their agents or  
orders from the storekeepers in the intcrior, these merchants would organize the goods and hire the  
carrying teams. They usuall y paid the co. t of transport. In dealing with high cartage in the winter of  
1854, Blainey indicated Ulat Melbourne merchants were the organizers of the goods for the interior. He  
said that 'during the winter of 1 R54 sO few drays could get mrough me mud to me Victorian goldfields  
that Melbourne merchants had to pay !lIe colossal sum of £100 a ton to send meir goods 100 miles into  
me interior (Blainey, The Tyranny of Distance, pp. 142-3). On the other hand. wholesale distribution in  
Melbourne was well developed. This can be round in the development of auctioneering as has been  
discussed in Chapter 4. 

251  
reap the extra profits after th ey had paid th e cost of transport. If the imports were  ordered and bought by merchants in the interior at the Melbourne wholesale prices, they  would gain their profits on their transactions when they could sold their goods at higher  prices. The ability to make profit was the major factor stimulating the supply of imports  and created additional difficulties in the adjustment of the supply of imports to demand.  
Conclusion  
The discussion in this chapter has led to a number of conclusions. The  assumption that prices in the intelior were higher than those in the coastal areas has been  confirmed by comparing prices in Melhourne and Bendigo which was taken as being  typical of the interior. It was found that the price level in the interior was particularly  high in the period 1852-54 hut gradually declined throughout the remainder of the  decade. Fluctuations in imports and wet seasons both affected the prices and their  downward trend. It was argued that the cost of transport, as refl ected by cartage and the  state of land communications, was the principal cause of hi gh prices in the interior.  Labour costs, particul arl y in the transport (or carrying) industry. were the most  important element in the high cost of transport. This chapter has also shown that the  great effort made by th e government to improve the condition of land communications  was an important factor in the reduc ti on of transport costs. The implications of high  prices in the interior for th e respo nse of supply to demand in the interior and in the  colony as a whole have also heen examined. In the period from the gold discoveries to  the last months of 1854, high prices in the interior greatly affected the consumption of  imports in the interior, and the location of much of th e demand in the interior caused  great difficulties in the adjustment of supply and aggrava ted the import surplus. Lower  prices from late 1854 favoured an increase in consumption in the interior during the  
commercial recovery in 1855, while the rise in prices in the interior from mid-1856 to  mid-I85? affected the slow-down in the accumulation of imports that occurred during  the second surge in imports. Late in the decade, the prices of goods (mainly imports) in  the interior continued to restrict the consumption of imports, and the need to supply the
