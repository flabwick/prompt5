The Second Fluctuation in Imports  
Introduction  
The second fluctuation in imports in the 1850s appeared in a new environment.  In the first half of the decade, the gold discoveries had a strong impact on many aspects  of the economy that subsequently underwent enormous changes. The commercial  sector, particularly imports, also experienced a tremendous surge and a decline as a  result of the gold discoveries. When compared with the first, two features of the second  fluctuation stand out: the smaller amplitude of the surge and decline in imports and the  prolonged period of commercial recession that partly co-existed with it. l Factors  endogenous to the supply of imports were now less powerful sources of mismatches  between supply and demand. As to exogenous influences, it seems that the impact of  gold production, the slow response of labour to the fall in real incomes per head in gold  mining, and government expenditure decisions all had a role to play. In addition, the  development of some local import-replacement also complicated the situation in the  market for imports.  
This chapter examines the process of the fluctuation, the smaller extent to which  the second surge in imports exceeded the demand, the causes of the fluctuation in  imports, the causes for the reduced amplitude, and the causes of the prolonged  commercial recession  
The development of the second fluctuation of imports  
The course of the second fluctuation in imports was similar to the first in that it  underwent a surge and a decline, but the amplitude of these movements was smaller. It  
1 The less violent movement in the economy in the second half of the 1850s was not limited to  The estimates of GDP by Butlin and Sinclair and nearly all otber relevant annual economic  Indicators such a immigration, prices, wages, confirm that the violence witb which tbe economy  changed was much less remarkable than in the first half of tbe decade.

was also associated with a changing commercial situation and changes in the economy  as a whole. The discussion of the second rise and fall in imports starts with the recovery  from the fIrst commercial depression  
The period of recovery in commerce (early in 1855 to the end of that year)  
The recovery from the fIrst depression in commerce depended largely on the  improvement of two conditions that had caused the depression. One was the level of  gold production. The sudden decline in gold production in September-October 1854 had  reduced the real income of miners on the goldfIelds and had pushed the commercial  situation from recession to depression by reducing consumption. The other condition  was the over-supply of imports which had led to the building up of excess stocks. The  recovery from the depression in the short run was dependent on a rise in gold output, a  decline in the supply of imports, and a reduction of stocks through an increase in  consumption.  
The increase in gold production at the end of 1854 marked the beginning of the  recovery. The monthly production of gold in September-October 1854 was probably the  lowest of the decade, but this low production did not last long. The sudden increase in  gold production at the end of 1854 and the high production for most of 1855 was a  powerful factor that contributed to taking the commerce out of depression. Gold exports  increased greatly in December 1854 when 288,673 ounces were exported (Appendix  6-1). This was about 250% of greater than the amount exported in October 1854. The  volumes of gold exported in January and February 1855 were both much more than  double the volume exported in October 1854. From early 1855, by which time the  amount alluvial gold remaining was diminishing after years of digging, many auriferous  quartz-reefs were opened up. Rushes occurred to St Arnaud, Castlemaine, Maldon,  Bendigo, Whipstick, Amherst-Talbot, Emu, Beauford, Ballarat Steiglitz, Blackwood,  Avoca, Dunolly-Inkerman, Buningyong, Daylesford, Beachworth, and other fields in  1855 (Appendix 1-1). Consequently gold production increased. It increased in May 
June 1855 and again in July-August, as shown in Appendix 6-1.

The revival of gold production in this period and the associated rise in miners'  incomes attracted a large number of people to the goldfields. In the period of March June 1855, the population on the Victorian goldfields increased by more than 50 per  cent. The number of adult males increased from 67,319 to 102,644.2 At the same time a  large number of immigrants from other colonies arrived in Victoria, intent on mining for  gold (Figure 7-17). The increasing demand from the mining population in the interior  for goods significantly reduced the accumulated supply of goods on the goldfields. As  said in the Argus:  
in our review of trade and commerce for our summary of the 21st August,  we had occasion to notice the continued stagnation of business arising from  various causes - the heavy stocks at the gold-fields, the high prices of  breadstuffs, and the want of all proportion between producers and  consumers in the colony. Since that date, however, the stocks on the gold 
fields have been materially diminished by the steady process of  consum ption. 3

The remarkable decline in imports also contributed to the recovery from a  depression which had arisen considerably from an extraordinary over-supply of goods.

Figure 8-1 shows that imports fell sharply and that the decline was continuous, except  for a small rise in the first quarter of 1855, from the fourth quarter of 1854 to the third  quarter of 1855, when they reached their lowest point since the second quarter of 1853.  The improvement in the relationship between the supply of imports and demand was felt  no later than May 1855. The general price level in 1855 was noticeably higher than in  the last months of 1854. According to the monthly report on 'The Colony of Victoria' in  the Argus, 'the gradual improvement we reported in our last in trade and commerce  generally has been tolerably maintained, and a feeling of greater security and firmer tone  has been manifest during the past month'. The same report continued with remarks on  the effects of the declining supply of goods on the improvement of the market situation:  
the arrivals of vessels have been few, and stocks of many articles have been  moved off at good price, many of them very remunerative indeed. Should  the amount of our imports still decrease, which the advices by the last mail  lead us to expect, the burdened holders of many descriptions of goods  which have been altogether unmarketable hitherto will be considerably  relieved.4  
This improvement continued. Speculative activities had almost entirely ceased in  the import market.5 The number of insolvencies was substantially reduced, as discussed  in the first section of the previous chapter. At the end of 1855 and early in 1856, local  feeling about the prospects for commerce was already rather optimistic. The situation  was described in this way in the Argus:  
the trading and commercial interests of the colony of Victoria will bear a  more favourable comparison with the corresponding period of last year than  any other interest. Confidence which was almost defunct at the former  period is now in a great measure restored. Failures in the mercantile circle  are few, and rumours reflecting on the stability of established firms are no  longer listened to. Speculation is confined to its legitimate limits, and the  needy adventurer is for the present out of place in the market 6  
One month later, the situation was further improved, and the same source thought  that the depression had totally ceased and that another period of universal prosperity had  come:

It gives us pleasure to state that nearly all traces of the late commercial crisis  have disappeared ... in its financial, agricultural, pastoral, mineral,  commercial, and we may add, political aspects, the colony was never in a  more satisfactory or hopeful condition. Insolvencies have all but ceased,  there is a great demand for able-bodied labourers of every description.7  
The above discussion of the revival of gold production and the re-establishment  of a balance between the supply of imports and demand, together with reports of the  improved situation of the Victorian market, suggests that the perioa of commercial  recovery existed from about early 1855 to the end of that year.  
The development of the second boom in imports  
The revival of gold production and the increase in the demand for imports  through an increase in the number of miners in 1855 took commerce out of the trough it  was in mainly in the third quarter of 1854 and stimulated a rapid increase in imports. A  further increase in gold production and in demand in 1856 led to a boom of imports late  1856 to late 1857.  
During 1856 another tide of imports began to build up.8 Large volumes of  imports from Britain started to arrived in the colony in March-April 1856. The arrival of  large quantities of goods suggests that no later than November 1856, and by November  at the latest there was an over-supply of imports. One of the contemporary reports  described this situation:  
the heavy stocks of most articles of imports, added to hourly expected  arrivals, have prevented any approach to advance in prices of goods, and  although increasing orders will attend the gradually reducing rates of cartage,  the arrivals expected by over-due ships, of which there are some dozen or  fourteen, will quite meet the country demands, and no prospect of increased  value seems probable, until consumption shall have increased in a greater  proportion than imports. 9  
This suggests that there was an excess of accumulated stocks and an increase in  newly arriving supplies no later than the end of 1856. During 1857 supplies continued  
7 Argus, 30 January 1856, p. 4.  
8 The literature regards the economic situation in 1856 as a fairly good one. For example, Coghlan  thought that 'taking Victoria as a whole, it may be said that the year 1856 was a fairly prosperous one'.  Labour and Industry in Australia, p. 733. Serle also commented that 'in 1856 there was a remarkably  quick recovery from the slump and retrenchment of 1854-5 despite relatively low public works  expenditure, for gold production was high, for once there was no glut of imports, and building revived'.  The Golden Age, p. 240.

to accumulate. In March 1857, as a result of the continued arrival of shipments and the  consequent accumulation of stocks, it was reported that 'trade will not be profitable': it  was clearly that many storekeepers engaged in the goldfields trade would be weeded  out. IO In August, although prices had generally been maintained, there was nearly a  total absence of sales by importers. In November it was reported that 'the market for  imported goods of most descriptions has ... exhibited an almost unprecedented degree  of inactivity'. 11  
The descriptions of the increase in imports in the market reports were consistent  with quantitative evidence on the increase in imports. Table 2-1 has shown that, in  comparison with 1855, net imports (in current value) in 1856 and 1857 increased by 25  per cent and 40 per cent respectively. However, the boom of imports in the second half  of the 1850s was much less remarkable than that in the first half. It built up and abated  gradually. The quarterly figures for imports into Melbourne in Appendix 6-4 suggest  that the second boom in imports lasted from late 1856 to late 1857. Imports declined  from the first quarter of 1858, and the annual values in the last three years of the decade  never returned to the level in 1857. The net imports were 84 per cent, 92 per cent and 87  per cent of the 1857 level for the last three years of the decade.  
As in the first fluctuation in imports, the second was related to the changing  commercial situation, which was in tum affected by the changing situation in the  economy as a whole. The first fluctuation, however, was connected with a 'commercial  boom', a 'commercial recession' and a 'commercial depression', while the second was  related to a 'commercial recovery', as has been discussed above, another 'commercial  boom' and another 'commercial recession'. These terms are borrowed from trade cycle  theory, as discussed in Introduction and Chapter 7.  
The period of the commercial boom (early 1856 to late 1856)  
Four features of the economy point to there being a commercial boom in this  period: the increased population, a stable level of prices, a rise in incomes, and the

373  
maintenance of a balance between supply and demand in the import market. It has been  suggested in the previous chapter that, in the first half of the 1850s, the maintenance of  a balance between demand and supply in the import market was a key feature of  commercial boom. There was both an increasing demand for imports and a concomitant  growth in supply. The existence of such a balance is still the most important signal of a  commercial boom in the latter half of the decade. On the other hand, however, some  elements that contributed to the earlier commercial 'boom', such as high commercial  profitability, increasing demand seemed to be weaker during the second commercial  'boom'.  
The output of gold was stable in 1855 but in 1856 there was a further increase  that led to another peak in gold production. At the same time there was a remarkable  increase in population, particularly an increase in adult males on the goldfields, as dealt  with earlier in this chapter. This led to an increase in the demand for imports. Moreover,  there was a slight rise in the wage rates of most occupations, for example blacksmiths,  general labourers on roads, 'married couples', stockkeepers and housemaids, as shown  in Appendix 6-2. This rise in the incomes of an increasing proportion of the working  population further increased the demand for imports. At the same time, prices were  stable, as shown in Appendix 7-1. In these circumstances a balance between the supply  of and the demand for imports suggests that trade was active, that commercial  profitability was stable, that the market was prosperous. The existence of this balance  could be assumed from the frequent reports of the market situation being good as  mentioned briefly above, and from the fact that, over this short period, there were no  contemporary reports of over-stocked markets, unprofitable transactions or active  speculations.  
The period of the commercial recession (early 1857 to 1860)  
Immediately after the second 'boom' of imports there was a prolonged  commercial recession that lasted beyond the end of the decade. The features of the  second commercial 'recession' were basically the same as those of the first, as  discussed in the previous chapter. In contrast to the previous 'recession', however, the 
374  
second 'recession was very prolonged. It is difficult to name a date marking the ending  of the second 'recession' within the decade. From early 1857 there was clearly a  commercial 'recession' marked by a long period of accumulation of imports, by low  prices, and by a low level of transaction. This was characteristic of the market for the  rest of the decade. There were many contemporary reports of recession in this period. 12  
. This state of recession in commerce after 1857 has also been documented in the  literature. As Coghlan has pointed out: 'From 1858 to the end of the period, Victoria  suffered from a species of commercial inanition and wages steadily declined' .13 Serle  also realized the length of the recession; he said that 'the economic crisis of the later  gold-rush period from 1857 to the early sixties hit Melbourne and Geelong hard'.14  This assessment, however, cannot be generalized to the economy as a whole. Butlin and  Sinclair's estimates of GDP suggest that when gold production declined the continuing  economic growth was sustained by the development of some local industries,  construction and personal services in particular. 1S The commercial sector, however,  could not avoid the depressive effect of a decline in the colony's leading sector. Though  the decline in gold production was offset by the increased output of the other sectors in  1859, commercial sector was slow to recover from the recession. The causes of the  slow recovery will be discussed in the last section of this chapter.  
The discussion in this section has demonstrated that there clearly was a second  fluctuation in imports that was associated with a changing commercial situation. This  discussion has also exposed three unsolved questions: the causes of the appearance of  the second fluctuation, the causes of this second surge of imports being of less  momentum than the first, and the relationship between the second surge in imports and  
12 Reports in the Argus showed that there was no substantial improvement of this state of affairs from  1857 to 1860. A number of dates when such reports can be seen are listed below: 2 February 1857, p. 4;  2 March 1857, p. 4; 6 April 1857, p. 4; 5 October 1857, p. 4; 1 March 1858, p. 4; 7 June 1858, p. 3;  5 July 1858, p. 4; 6 September 1858, p. 4; 4 October 1858, p. 4; 8 November 1858, p. 7; 4 February  1859; 7 March 1859, p. 6; 12 September 1859, p. 6; 5 December 1859, p. 6; 2 January 1860, p. 7 and  6 February 1860, supplement.

the prolonged commercial recession. These questions will be dealt with in the fmal three  sections.  
The extent to which the supply of imports exceeded demand  
The extent of the second wave of imports can be seen in the series of imports in  current value shown in Table 2-1 which shows that the second wave was much smaller  than the flrst one. The smaller extent of the second wave of imports can also be seen in  the data on imports as a proportion of GDP as estimated by Butlin and Sinclair. 16  However, when the implication of this for the relationship between the supply of  imports and demand are considered, it will be necessary to measure this wave of  im ports against demand. This has not been done before.!7 This section, which is a  continuation of Section 2 of the previous chapter, makes an assessment of the extent to  which the second surge of imports matched demand in the second half of the decade.  This involves a consideration of annual imports in current prices, net imports per head  in constant prices, and quarterly imports in current prices as well as the purchasing  power of the working population.  
In terms of annual imports in current prices, imports in 1856 and 1857 were not  far from those in 1853 and 1854. Net imports in 1854 was 118 per cent of those in  1853, in 1856, 96 per cent, and in 1857, 107 per cent, as shown in Table 2-1.  However, the increasing size of the population made the ratio of the value of imports to  the population much smaller in 1856 and 1857. Table 2-4 showed that this ratio declined  in 1856 and 1857 by no less than 40 per cent in comparison with 1853 and 1854.  Figure 8-2 shows the relationship between imports and population over an extended  period. Table 2-4 showed the same result, in terms of annual net imports per head in  
16 BuUin and Sinclair, 'Australian Gross Domestic Product 1788-1860', p. 132.  17 The existence of this second wave of imports has been pointed out., but no effort has been made to  measure it. For example, according to Serle 'Victoria ... had cyclical problems enough of its own of  which the most important, perhaps, were the fluctuations in import-<:onsignments which continually  upset the market and bad wide repercussions ... In 1856 there was a remarkably quick recovery from the  slump and retrenchment of 1854-5 ... In 1857, however ... once again English consignors flooded the  market with goods.' Serle, The Golden Age, p. 240.

constant value. These comparisons suggest that the second surge in imports was much  smaller than the flrst

If a comparison is made between two shorter periods that covered a part of the  two booms in imports, the extent to which the second was smaller than the flrst can also  be seen. Table 8-1 compares the two booms in imports with the size of the population.  The flrst quarters of 1854 and 1857 have been selected as representative periods, and  the size of the population in the censuses of March 1854 and 1857 is used as  representative of population size. The table shows that, although the current value of  imports in 1854 was about 30 per cent higher than in 1857, the average value per head  of the net imports into Melbourne in the boom of 1857 was only equal to 40 per cent of  that in 1854. A similar picture was also shown in Figure 7-13. It is clear that the second  boom was less than half the magnitude of the flrst  
On the other hand, in considering the relationship between the surge in imports  and the purchasing power of the Victorian working population, two remarkable changes  are found in the incomes of three categories of workers (the significance of these  workers in representing the working population has been discussed in the previous 
377  
chapter). First, there was a remarkable decline in gold mining which greatly affected  wage rates. Figures 7-7 to 7-12 have shown that the wage rates for nearly every type of  occupation fell dramatically between July and November 1854. Thereafter they did not  return to the previous high level (though there was a general increase in 1855-56 that  proved to be a factor contributing to the remarkable increase in population). For  example, wage rates for 'married couples', stockkeepers, ploughmen, and shepherds  remained at a low level at the end of 1854; and the rates for skilled workers  progressively declined, as in the cases of carpenters, masons, bullock-drivers, cooks  and compositors. Second, the relationship between the incomes of the working  population and prices also changed during the second fluctuation in imports. Table 7-2  show that skilled workers' wage rates were slightly lower than prices relative to the  period before the gold discoveries. The wage rates of general labourers such as female  servants, 'married couples', stockkeepers and bullock drivers, however, were higher in  relation to prices than before the gold rush. The income of labourers on the goldfields  had declined remarkably.

To reach a conclusion on the extent to which the second surge in imports matched  demand, it is necessary to go back to Table 7-2. This table suggests three things. First,  using 1850 as the base year (=100) representing the period before the gold discoveries,  net imports per person declined from 210 and 190 in 1853 and 1854 to 114 in 1856 and  88 in 1857. This suggests that by 1857 the average amount of imports per head had 
378  
returned to a level close to that of the period before the gold discoveries. Then, there  was enormous deflation in both the coastal area and in the interior. The deflation also  greatly increased the purchasing power of the working population. Finally, the  assumption that the pattern of consumption remained unchanged since 1850, taking  1856 and 1857 as a whole, and taking no account of the development of import 
replacement industries, which will be dealt with later in the chapter, imports were 2 to  14 per cent less than the demand of skilled workers and general labourers, but exceeded  the demand of labourers on the goldfields by about 80 per cent. If it is assumed that the  skilled workers and general labourers represent the population in the coastal area,  imports in 1856 and 1857 were even less than the demand of about one-third of the  population of the colony.18 However, for the two-thirds of the population in the  interior, principally on goldfields, the average imports represented an amount much  higher than demand. As during the first surge in imports, the people in the interior  
remained a weaker source of consumption than those in the coastal area  The causes of the second boom in imports  
The first cause of the second surge in imports was the increase in demand and the  consequent maintenance of the level of prices brought about by gold mining. The  statistics behind Figure 8-3 show that the share of gold of the total value of exports was  as high as 77 per cent in 1856 and 73 per cent in 1857. Butlin and Sinclair's estimates  of Victorian GDP also show mining making up 39 per cent of the total in 1856 and 34  per cent in 1857, larger than any other sector. 19 The relatively stable production of gold  for most of 1855 and another peak of production in 1856 greatly favoured an increase in  demand, both directly and indirectly through the induced increase in the population of  the colony as a whole, and particularly in the number of people on the goldfields (Figure  8-4).  
18 The proportion of the Victorian population living in the coastal areas was only 33 per cent in 1857.  Victoria, Census, 1857.  
19 BuUin and Sinclair, 'Australian Gro s Domestic Product 1788-1860', p. 132. 
379  
The increase in demand brought increased prices in late 1855 (though this was  also partly due to the serious drought).20 Prices remained high throughout 1856.  Appendix 6-3 shows that for a short period the prices of most foodstuffs were at or  even above the general level before the depression at the end of 1854. The prices of  some items in great demand, including various kinds of wine and spirits, sugar and tea,  remained steady or increased. The prices of some foodstuffs also remained at the 1854  level, for example, of ham, cheese and coffee. In the meantime, the price of flour,  wheat, butter, and salt did not decline until late 1856 when the market became glutted.  The gold discoveries had brought about a tremendous inflation in Victoria and to a lesser  extent in the other Australian colonies. Hence there appeared a big gap in prices between  Victoria and the exporting countries, Britain in particular. This gap reached its greatest  extent around mid-1853, but declined thereafter. There were, however, fluctuations,  and Victorian prices were at least 50 per cent higher than those in Britain in 1856 and  1857, as shown in Figure 7-3.

The second cause of a renewed surge in imports was speculation. The existence  of the remarkable difference in prices between Victoria and the exporting countries gave  rise to this speculation in imports. While this price difference existed, any sign of  substantial increase in demand, due to the restored prospects of gold or of prosperity  generally, would trigger off a sudden increase in supply, which in turn would tend to  exceed the real demand to the extent that it involved speculation. Speculation was clearly  a factor contributing to the second surge of imports. The investigation in section 3 of  Chapter 3 has pointed out that, in comparison with the first boom in imports, the  speculative activities of overseas traders was very much reduced during the second  boom in imports. It has also been suggested that local importers were mainly  responsible for the imports situation during the second fluctuation in imports.  Nonetheless, according to contemporary reports, some foreign exporters did rush into  
the export business without an accurate estimate of the real level of demand in the  colony and without fully considering other sources of supply. This state of affairs was  described by 1. M'Culloch, the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne  for 1856, in his retiring address, as reported in the Argus: 
381  
the glutted state of our markets had caused serious losses to the exporters  hither; on them the direct loss had principally fallen, for, although the  colonists have themselves largely imported, they were conversant with the  articles suited to our wants, and the season when the different descriptions  of goods ought to arrive here, while the outside stray consignors, not fully  posted up as to our requirements, induced by the reports of high prices,  have rushed into the business, and made shipments without carefully  studying the exports by other parties influenced by the same expectations as  themsel ves. 21  
A third cause of the second surge in imports was government expenditure  decisions. The gold discoveries and production in the Victorian interior posed an  enormous transport problem for the government. Before the mid-1850s (actually from  1853) government outlay on public works had taken up a considerable part of  government expenditure and this played a role in the first boom in imports and the  downturn, as has been discussed in the previous chapter. In this period the  improvement to roads and bridges also took up a considerable proportion of government  expenditure, as has been examined in Chapter 5. In the second half of the 1850s, while  government expenditure on roads and bridges did not decline substantially, more focus  was put on railway construction. Because of the failure of private railway companies,  the government took over railway construction. 22 Most of the money needed was  borrowed from overseas. Loans were raised in England in the last few years of the  decade, with the sum reaching £5,676,960 by the close of 1861.23 In the 1850s and  early 1860s Victoria was the first colony to invest in railways and land communications  on a large scale. For example, by 1862 the 214 miles of railway open in Victoria  represented 58 per cent of the total in Australia.24 By 1860 Victorian loan raisings  overseas were over 80 per cent of the Australian total. 25 This government expenditure  raised demand in the economy as a whole. The two ways in which the supply of  imports was affected by government expenditure decisions has been described in the  
21 Argus. 6 April 1857. p. 4.  
22 The cases of failure in Victoria has been summarized by Coghlan. Some of the shorter lines by  private enterprise were successful such as tho e from Melbourne to Hobson's Bay and from Melbourne  to St Kilda. But private enterprise could not build the longer lines mainly due to financial problems.  Labour and Industry in Australia. pp. 837-40. The failures have been examined by Butlin, Investment in  Australian Economic Development', pp. 302-3.

previous chapter. Government decisions in the latter half of the decade also encouraged  the supply of imports to a certain extent  
Finally, the transfer of information was still slow. This, which had increased the  difficulties in the adjustment of the supply of imports to demand in the first boom in  imports, was also a factor in the second surge in imports. According to the 'Shipping  Intelligence' in the Argus in January 1857, twenty-seven ships arrived in Melbourne  from Britain after an average voyage of ninety-two days, and two ships from America  after an average voyage of ninety-nine days. This represented a decrease of 20 per cent  in the length of time of voyages in comparison with the period of the first boom in  imports. Nonetheless, the slow transfer of information was not improved substantially  in this period. 26 This can partly explain why a large amount of imports continued to  enter the colony when the market was glutted with supplies in late 1856, as discussed in  the first section.  
Reasons why the second boom was smaller than the first  
The fact that the second boom in imports had a smaller amplitude than the first  has been established. Four reasons for this can be identified: the smaller impact of gold  production, the smaller gap in prices between exporting countries and Victoria, a  cautious attitude on the part of importers and an increase of import replacement. The  first two causes had been strong factors in bringing about the first boom in imports,  while the last two had been insignificant.  
First, gold production had a smaller impact on promoting the second boom in  imports than on the first. The strong impact of gold production on the first boom of  imports was dealt with in the previous chapter in relation to the rich discoveries of  alluvial gold that suddenly increased the total output of the economy and hence the  demand for imports, to the high average returns from gold mining and the consequent  
26 These figures refer only to average ships. Clippers made faster voyage. For example, Norfolk made  its five passages from London to Australia in an average of 68 days. The differences in voyage times  between the clippers and most other ships bas been pointed out in Blainey, The Tyranny of Distance.  pp. 191-2. 

383  
rise in general wage rates that attracted a large number of immigrants and so further  raised demand, and to the widespread over-optimistic confidence in inexhaustibility of  the gold deposits. 27 However, these now operated with less force, even though the  recovery in gold production in 1855 and the further increase in 1856 were important  stimuli for the second boom in imports. The registered annual gold output in 1856 was  25 per cent higher than in 1854 (as shown in Figure 8-4) and the total GDP increased by  43 per cent over the same period. Though this was an enormous increase, it could not  be compared with the 250 per cent increase in real GDP from 1851 to 1853. On the  other hand, in comparison with 1853 and 1854 the numbers of adult males on the  goldfields had increased greatly and this considerably reduced the average income of  gold miners. Figure 8-4 shows that population and especially the numbers of adult  males grew faster than the output of gold. In consequence, the average returns to gold  miners in 1856 were only half those in 1853, as shown in Figure 8-5. More and more  diggers became wage earners employed by the gold companies, and the possibility of  individual diggers making a fortune was now lower. Accordingly, the general wage  rates in the period 1856-60 were equal to 50-70 per cent of the levels of 1853-4 as  discussed in the second section. Moreover, it was recognized that gold was not  inexhaustible and that the alluvial gold was now much depleted. 28  
The restricted constraint in earnings in Victoria and in other Australian colonies  made the inducement to migrate much weaker. Consequently, the net gain in immigrants  was much smaller. In 1852, one year before the first commercial boom started, the total  net gain from immigration by sea had been 63,626. However, in 1856, one year before  the second commercial boom, the corresponding figure was only 20,407. These facts  suggest that gold production, considered as the original impulse for immigration, now  performed a much less important role than it had done a few years earlier as a factor  promoting population growth.  
27 There were many reports of people's confidence in inexhaustibility gold. For example, a report said  that the 'settled industry [gold industry] now universally prevails, there being great confidence in the  future prospects of this country' . Argus, 20 February 1854, p. 4.  
28 From the end of 1854 it was recognized that the gold was not inexhaustible and this was reported in  the Argus, 23 November 1854, p. 4.

Second, the gap between the prices in exporting countries and those in Victoria  had largely closed. The previous chapter has pointed out that most overseas imports  came to Victoria from Britain and that the gap in prices between Britain and Victoria was  an important source of commercial profits. Figure 7-3 has shown that the price of  merchandise in the Victorian market was 100-200 per cent higher than the prices in  Britain in the period from the last months of 1852 to the end of 1853. The higher the  prices in the Victorian market, the stronger the inducement to bring goods to Victoria.  This prospect of high profits from the price differences was considerably reduced by the  gradual deflation that occurred from the latter half of 1853. The gap between prices  became smaller: Victorian prices was about 50 per cent higher than those in Britain in  1856-57 (Figure 7-3). If freight and insurance are taken into account, the prospects of  high profits had been significantly reduced.  
Third, the commercial depression in 1854 had greatly changed the carefree  attitudes of those who had earlier been involved in bringing in imports. The virtue of  greater caution that was actually exercised after a reassessment of the demand for  imports in the colony was widely regarded as the most important lesson learnt from this  bitter experience. This new and more cautious attitude prevailing in commercial circles 
385  
contributed considerably to the reduction in supply. The experience of the depression  was so bitter that it made businessmen review their previous behaviour and their future  prospects. The Argus put it thus in 1855:  
the dearly bought experience of the last two years has created a caution  which will be likely, so far as the colonists are concerned, to prevent a  relapse into the over-trading which on this side greatly contributed to  produce the late lamentable crisis.29  
Thereafter the public was repeatedly told of the necessity for caution: 'every one  ... will well understand how necessary it is to observe the strictest caution'. 30 Hence,  for most of the period of the second boom in imports, a cool mind became the dominant  attitude of both local merchants and, to a lesser extent, those in foreign countries,  towards commercial opportunities in the Australian colonies. This attitude, which was  maintained throughout the remainder of the decade, was principally manifested in  several interrelated ways that significantly curbed the extent of the over-supply of  imports in the period 1856-57.  
Constant warnings of over-supply formed the main theme in this period of nearly  all the commercial reports sent overseas from the colony, and to Britain in particular. In  the belief that over-supply had been the root cause of the previous depression, Victorian  commercial circles and the media kept suggesting, from early 1855, that overseas  traders should pay attention to Australian opinion about trading prospects:  
we would earnestly impress upon all who wish to carryon a profitable trade  with Australia to regard more the ad vices from the colonies than the home  facilities of credit. In this way only can a safe and legitimate trade be  maintained.3l  
Overseas suppliers were advised to study the colony's real level of consumption  and its specific requirements. The following quotation is representative of the advice  given in the Argus:  
29 Argus, 24 December 1855, p. 5.  
30 Argus, 14 March 1856, p. 7.  
31 Argus, 10 April 1855, p. 4. 
386  
is no doubt whatever that the Australian market will long present a fine  fleld for the producer and the capitalist of other communities, but it will  always require careful study. Advice from this side must be carefully  followed, and the limited amount of our population should be borne in  mind. To the casual shipper, whose opportunities of studying our wants and  the means taken to supply them are limited and uncertain, our market will  always be a hazardous one. Our tastes and our habits must be studied.32  
In addition, as soon as any sign of accumulation of stocks appeared, specific  warning reports were immediately conveyed to foreign ports. Thus it was reported in  1856:  
very few recently arrived cargoes have had to wait long for a market,  especially of provisions, well-assorted invoices of hardware, crockery, and  soft goods. Greater caution than ever is, however, needed in making  shipments to this market. The extraordinary falling-off in the immigration to  the colony must be constantly borne in mind.33  
The warnings preventing over-supply proved to be so well respected that there  were no significant signs of over-importing till the middle of 1856. The contribution  which this cautious behaviour on the part of suppliers made to the maintenance of a  good state of trade was a constant theme; for example:  
during the early part of the present season, caution has been the main feature  of our trade, and, on the whole, it has been found to work well, or at any  rate better than over-speculation.34  
In addition, the real demand of the colony was now reflected more accurately in  the actions of suppliers than it had been even a few years earlier. After 1855 the pattern  of population distribution changed remarkably, with the proportion in the interior  growing bigger. The censuses reveal that the population of the interior formed 55 per  cent of total population in March 1854 and 67 per cent in March 1857. So, it can be  estimated that in earl y 1856 the population of the interior could not have been less than  60 per cent of the total population of Victoria. This pattern of population distribution  shows that consumption was greater in the interior. This suggests that the behaviour of  the storekeepers, who were the principal commercial businesses in the interior, and  
32 Argus, 24 December 1855, p. 5.

387  
other types of retailers would strongly influence the extent to which a proper estimate of  demand in the Victorian market was made }5  
During the previous boom the prevailing speculative spirit had led to the demand  for goods being overestimated. A contemporary report on how this state of affairs came  about stated:  
the excitement which begins with importers is communicated to dealers, and  from dealers to shopkeepers; and the many thousands of which the latter  class consists, each at the same time increasing his stock, from the  impression that prices will rise still higher, produces the appearance of a  great consumption, when, in point of fact, it is only an increase of retail  stocks to remain on hand in anticipation of future wants. When a mania of  this kind once begins it it difficult to say where it will end}6  
Storekeepers and other retailers formed the last link in the commercial network,  and the extent to which they were affected by the speculative atmosphere in turn affected  their suppliers' attitudes to the market. It also largely affected the degree to which real  immediate demand could be reflected. Previously, the storekeepers had laid in large  stocks on many occasions. In 1856 the circumstances had changed greatly. An  important lesson learned by these small businesses from the unhappy experience of  heavy losses in the previous depression was to purchase quantities of goods strictly for  immediate use, and significantly improved communications made this mode of purchase  easier. This became widespread from early 1855. There were many reports describing  this situation; for example, the Argus reported that 'at present - and the remark applies to  all branches of trade - there is little disposition to purchase except for immediate use' ,37  and 'the chief transactions are for goods to meet present demands' .38 The period from  February to April was the season when large stocks were usually laid in by storekeepers  in order to avoid rising prices in the winter that were due to heavy rains and the high  cartage costs. The usual pattern of purchasing also changed in 1856. As was reported:  
35 An investigation of commercial businesses in the interior has been made on the basis of Victorian  commercial directories. The result shows thaI., for example, in Bendigo there were 149 storekeepers and  grocers and 2 merchants in 1853 102 and 14 in 1857; in Ballarat there were 68 storekeepers and 16  merchants in 1856 and 105 and 25 in Ovens in 1857.  
36 Argus, 14 March 1856, p. 7.

388  
A detennination evidently exists among the inland traders to avoid excessive  stocks for the coming winter. Many, indeed, openly state that for all but the  two or three staple articles of consumption they intend to rely on the  Melbourne market rather than risk the overstocking of the interior which  characterized the past season.39  
This cautious approach to purchasing goods by storekeepers continued. When  Melbourne was over-supplied again in 1857, the storekeepers in the interior remained  cautious: 'with the exception of flour there has been little or no specUlative demand and  purchases have been confined solely to goods for immediate use'.40  
Moreover, credit was controlled more tightly than previously and cash payments  dominated the market. Loose credit had helped to create the earlier wide-spread  speculation. The consequent experience of losses and insolvencies brought about the  change to a system of cash payment that came to dominate the Victorian market by no  later than early 1855. As the Argus reported:  
One consequence of the disaster in 1854 has been a prostration of  confidence, which has led to a system of cash, that has been in operation for  many months past. The houses which supply the interior, having to pay  cash to the importer, cannot give credit to the country storekeepers, and the  latter have not been able to take their usual supplies at this season.41  
This system actually penetrated all levels of commercial transactions, and its  coverage was so thorough that 'in town flour and provisions generally are now sold for  cash only, and many finns stipulate payment before delivery' .42 In the interior, 'the  demand for the diggings continues, and the orders would be very much greater were it  not for the fact that cash is the rule for all kinds of provisions' .43  
The tightness of credit was due in part to the banks. The data for Figure 7-21 (see  also Appendix 6-7) show that the ratio of assets to paid-up capital, which is probably  the best indicator of the condition of credit, was maintained between 2.07 and 2.37 over  the period 1856-58, far below the range of 3.0 to 3.6 prevailing in the previous boom.  A contemporary report commented that 'the great cause of the dullness as present

42 Argus, 1 January 1855, p. 4.

389  
existing is the difficulty of realizing for cash' .44 Consequently, 'the banks are very  much blamed in many quarters, for having done much towards causing the present  stagnation' .45 It is necessary to add that banks indeed contributed to creating the slump  by curbing purchasing power. However, on the other hand, this measure limited the  wild speculation and consequent losses.  
An increase in production for import replacement by local industries also reduced  the demand for imports. The severe depression in 1854-55 provided something more  than a lesson in matching supply to demand. It showed the necessity for the  development of local industries. Taking the Australian colonies as a whole, Sinclair  pointed out that, '[a] flood of imports went some way towards meeting the demand but  the price mechanism played the central role of cutting off the demand for some goods  and services and of directing local production towards the necessities of life' .46 The  process of developing local products for import replacement can be clearly seen in  Victoria after 1855. From 1856 gold production began to decline, and the associated  decline in marginal productivity in gold mining induced a large number of ex-miners and  new migrants to seek other pursuits, even though the number of people taking part in  gold production did not reach a peak until some time later. The most significant import replacement industries were agriculture and manufacturing.  
After the gold discoveries, agriculture did not undergo significant further  development till 1854, by which time the acreage under cultivation had just returned to  the level of 1851. However, more than half of the cultivated area was then under hay for  livestock and only little more than 20 per cent under wheat. The wheat acreage was 60  per cent smaller than in 1851. This state of affairs improved dramatically in 1855. The  area under cultivation increased by 60,000 acres in that year, an increase that was even  larger than the total of cultivated land in 1854. Thereafter the area of land under  cultivation increased rapidly until 1860.47 The size of the agricultural labour force also  increased enormously. The number of workers in agriculture was 75 per cent greater in  
44 Argus. 2 February 1857. p. 4.

390  
1854 than in 1851, compared with the 200 per cent increase in population. The net  increase in the agricultural labour force, however, was 250 per cent between 1854 and  1857, whereas the population grew by 60 per cent in the same period. The second boom  in imports thus overlapped with the period of rapid development in agriculture. The  increase in the production of agricultural products reduced the demand for imports.  Figure 8-6 shows the declining value per head of imported flour and grain in this  period. The contemporary feeling about the future of agriculture was optimistic, and it  was said that 'we are daily becoming less and less dependent upon foreign countries for  our agricultural supplies'.48 According to an estimate in April 1857, 'agriculture is very  extensively prosecuted and at least one third of the breadstuffs required by the  population is raised and manufactured within the colony' .49 Instead of being limited to  grains, the progress in agriculture also extended to vegetables, vines, and so forth. The  output of such commodities as potatoes, onions, carrots, cabbages, and wine increased  remarkably. The comprehensive development of agriculture was reported thus:  
in every direction there have been the most convincing proofs of rapid  agricultural progress ... production is rapidly advancing upon the  consumption, and there seems a sure prospect that in the course of a year or  two the colony will be altogether independent of foreign suppliers in regard  to the chief articles of food for the support of its great and rapidly  increasing population.50  
The fact proved to be that 'by 1858 the colony was growing almost half the wheat  consumed and was self-sufficient in potatoes'.51 By the end of the decade the cultivated  area of Victorian was much greater than that of New South Wales and nearly the same  size as that of South Australia.52  
Manufacturing developed ill a similar fashion. In the census of 1851,  manufacturing occupations were included with commerce and trade in a single category,  though mechanics and artificers formed a separate category. So the size of the labour  force in manufacturing before the gold discoveries cannot be identified accurately in the

census. However, it has been estimated by Linge that 'immediately prior to the gold rushes there were probably no more than about 600 people in Victoria engaged in what  could even broadly be described as factory industry' .53 The same remark might be made  with reference to the labour force in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Table  8-2 shows that there were 68 manufacturing establishments in Victoria in 1850,  consisting principally of 30 mills, 14 factories making beverages and 13 processors of  animal products. The remainder included 6 metal and 5 soap and candle factories. This  was the basic state of Victorian manufacturing before gold. The scale was tiny and  provided only for the necessities of life. Small manufacturing underwent rapid growth  from 1854. This experience was quite different from that of New South Wales.54

The development of agriculture, the pastoral industry, and the improved methods  of gold mining also contributed to the growth of manufacturing. The substantially  increased agricultural production led to an increase in the number of processing  installations, which stimulated business for local engineering and metal manufacturing  firms. In the pastoral industry, the newly introduced wool-presses and wool-washing  machinery also contributed to local manufacturing. In gold mining, the steam engine

was first adopted in 1853. As alluvial gold was diminishing, the need to use effective  machinery in mining became increasingly important.55 The growing complexity of gold mining technology, on the other hand, also encouraged other local manufactures. The  increasing depths of the workings created a demand for flat ropes and for improved  types of leather glands for pumps.

competition and that the number of manufactures only recovered to the level of 1850 by the end of the  decade. 'Supply-side Shocks'. p. 15.  
55 According to Smyth. there were at least seven engines on the Ballarat field alone at the end of 1854.  Thereafter the use of steam power. particularly to pump water and crush quartz. became common on all  the fields though especially on those around Ballarat and Bendigo. By 1859.285 engines were being used  on the alluvial fields and a further 296 in quartz mining operations. Thus from about 1856 metal 
working. boiler-making and engineering works began to appear on the gold-fields and especially at  Ballarat. Bendigo and Castiemaine. Smyth. The Gold Fields and Mineral Districts of Victoria. pp. 455-

In these circumstances, manufacturing activity jumped again in 1854-55 and  1856-57. The number of enterprises increased from 152 in 1854 to 438 in 1857, with  metal manufactures showing the most rapid growth (Table 8-2). The growth of  processing capacity, which has been regarded as part of manufacturing in a broad sense,  can be seen in the lower value per head of imported timber. Figure 8-8 shows that the  value per head of timber imports declined substantially from 1855, when construction  nearly ceased, except for public work on roads. In 1856 and part of 1857 building work  was active and a considerable proportion of the net increase of 86,727 dwellings from  1851 to 1857 was built after 1855.56 Timber was probably the most important building  material. The number of steam saw mills increased from 7 in 1853 to 45 in 1856 and  again to 48 in 1857 and 66 in 1858. The decline in the value of timber imports might  have been partly due to the decrease in imports of processed timber mainly from  Tasmania and Germany.  
Accordingly, the size of the industrial labour force also increased greatly, as  shown in Figure 8-7. It cannot be assumed that the increase in the number of  manufacturers and in the labour force employed in manufacturing indicates the extent to  which local manufactured goods were substituted for imports. At that stage  manufacturing was actually just beginning; processing work was the main part of  manufacturing. Nevertheless, the largely improved capacity of local manufacturing and  processing installations, together with the the development of small workshops,  indicated the potential for production and that there was a bright future ahead to the  industry. These facts enabled commercial circles to warn British merchants:  
it is very important that our friends at a distance should know that this colony  is not merely a gold-producing country. There are here extensive and  numerous breweries. Dairies are established in the neighbourhood of all our  towns and gold-fields, and large supplies of butter and cheese are  produced.57

The discussion in this section has suggested that a number of factors reduced the  amount of imports during the second fluctuation in imports. These reduced the  difficulties of adjusting the supply of imports to demand. Nevertheless, there was a  prolonged commercial recession that overlapped and outlasted the second surge in  imports. A discussion of the causes of this recession is the topic of next section.  
The causes of the second commercial recession  
The prolonged commercial recession reflected in part the beginning of the long term decline in gold production. Partly, also, it was due to the existence of about a two  years' lag between the onset of the decline in gold production and the compensating  growth of other sectors of the economy. This lag probably contributed most to the  length of the recession. Inflexibility in the movement of the labour force in response to  changes in the employment situation and an inadequate appreciation of the strength of  the growing import replacement industries also contributed to the recession.

The considerable decrease in gold production affected the demand for imports  through a fall in real incomes per head on the goldfields. Gold production on the whole  fell by nearly one-quarter in the period 1857-59. This proved to be the beginning of the  lone-term decline in gold production. A direct consequence of this decline was the  reduction in average returns from gold digging. Figure 8-5 shows that the average  returns declined from early 1856 and this trend continued. Accordingly, the wage rates  for most of occupations fell in 1857-58 to varying degrees, as shown in Appendix 6-2.  Under these circumstances it was inevitable that the demand for imports would be  affected and that there should be a recession during this period.  
This was particularly the case because there was a lag between the decline of gold  production and the compensatory growth of other industries. Butlin and Sinclair's  estimates of GDP show that, while the proportion of total real GOP that was accounted  for by all sectors other than gold was maintained in 1857 and 1858, the share of gold  declined by nearly 17 per cent in 1857 and by nearly 19 per cent in 1858, which led to a  decline of nearly 4 per cent and a further decline of 12 per cent in the total real GDP in  these two years. This decline in gold production caused a decrease of nearly 19 per cent  and a further 17 per cent in real GOP per head in these two years. On the other hand, the  development of other local industries more than offset the decline in gold production in 
396  
1858-59 when the annual growth rate of real GDP jumped sharply. The non-gold  sectors maintained the momentum of growth in the economy in 1859-60 even though  gold production fell by 8 per cent in that year. Each of the non-primary, pastoral,  manufacturing, distribution, personal services, rents, and public construction sectors  made a compensatory contribution to the maintenance of the growth of the economy as  gold mining was in the course of long-term decline. 58 Particular attention should be paid  to the rapid development of construction, manufacturing, agriCUlture, and the pastoral  industry. Construction and manufacturing not only absorbed a large number of ex 
miners and made a significant contribution to the growth of the economy towards the  end of the 1850s, but also were the crucial sectors of the economy in the next thirty  years.59  
It can be seen that there was a period of two years between the decline in gold  production and the compensatory growth of other sectors of the economy. This period  is here provisionally called a period of 'growth compensation'. This period, especially  the year 1858 which represented the lowest level of real GDP per head in the decade,  suggested a decline in the purchasing power of the working population. It was, in terms  of conventional trade-cycle theory, a stage of economic recession. The phenomenon of  commercial recession was largely caused by the recession in economic growth and was  a part of the economic recession as a whole.  
A further factor in the recession was a tendency for the labour force to be less  mobile in the face of the decline in real income from gold mining. The dominant  influence on the growth of the Victorian population before the 1860s was immigration.  It has been learned from the discussion in Chapter 7 that when the first boom in supply  occurred the high tide of immigration had actually passed. This constituted the root  contradiction between demand and supply and was a source of the severe commercial  depression. Figure 8-10 suggests that there were three surges in immigration in the  1850s, the last being in 1857. The net gain in immigrants in that year was over 40,000,
