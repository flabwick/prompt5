3. THE CHANGING COMPOSITION OF ACTIVITY 
The high rate of growth of gross domestic product was not the result of particularly rapid development of the export industries; still less was it due primarily to a specialised dependence on the pastoral industry. The radical changes which occurred in the composition of activity as between the beginning of the 'sixties and the end of the 'eighties display clearly enough the underlying incentives and the dominant tasks of Australian economic growth. These were the overriding pressure to provide basic social and productive capital equipment, especially in urban communities, the need to overcome the obstacle of distance in sparsely settled territory by the establishment and operation of organised systems of communication, the desire of the great majority to settle in urban, especially metropolitan, centres and the lucrative, but technic- ally specialised, opportunities in exploiting highly productive natural 
resources. 
Differences in relative rates of growth as between the main industrial subdivisions of gross product did not necessarily produce great changes in the composition of the economy as a whole. A comparison of com- pound rates of growth provides one means of identifying leading sectors but it should be borne in mind that some sectors were so slight that their speed of growth made little difference to over-all rates of growth or to their sectoral shares in gross product. On the other hand, relatively modest rates of growth of major components may be much more significant. The main industrial subdivisions are ranked in terms of their compound rates of growth in constant prices over the whole period of expansion, 1861-89 (see table 4).

The four most rapidly growing components were railways, manu- facturing, construction and pastoral activity. The first of these grew at a tremendous pace, almost three times as rapidly as gross product.

17 other hand, one must also take into account the fact that railway rating policy was designed to limit the non-labour earnings in railway trans- port in order to provide external economies to other industrial sub- divisions. Nevertheless, more significant because of its greater size, manufacturing expanded almost twice as fast as gross domestic product, and was the most specific indicator of the basic social and economic transformation towards a predominantly urban society. 
In more general terms, commodity production dominated the fast- growing sectors. Apart from railways and distribution, the rise of other important services was slower than gross product as these services. became, over the whole period, less significant parts of the economy. House rents almost kept pace with the economy as a whole, reflecting once again the role of urbanisation and the emergence of a settled wealthy society. But public services and personal and professional services lost ground considerably. The one marked exception to this contrast between commodity and service output was in mineral produc- tion which was actually decadent for most of the period, recovering to just a little above its 1861 level by the end of the 'eighties. 
No single ranking can be conclusive. Even in terms of comparisons of rates of growth over the whole period 1861-89, one must take into account any exceptional values of particular components affecting the calculated rates of growth. This is particularly the case with agriculture, with very low output figures in the first years of the 'sixties. But much more important, the relative rates of growth changed greatly within the long period of expansion. Figs. 1 and 2 adopt the ranking shown above, except for agriculture and water transport. They display the detailed pattern of change in relative rates of growth of all subdivisions over the whole forty years to 1900. 
This comparison of the whole series of components is useful for several purposes. For the moment, the striking implication is the change in relative rates of growth at about the same date, 1876-77, at which a critical decline in productivity as a whole occurred. In this case, the dating cannot be so precise since so many components are affected. But the years at which significant changes in rates of growth of a large number of important series occurred are, none the less, concentrated between 1873 and 1879 and, in fact, seven of them can be dated at 1876-77. The contrast is indicated in table 5. Four basic features of the first subperiod should be noted: 
(a) Growth until 1877 relied, very much more than the longer-run rates of growth to 1889 suggest, on the attempts to utilise Australian natural resources directly. The failure to find a major mineral substitute for gold brought down the output of the mining industry continuously until 1879/80. But all other primary industries-pastoral, agricultural,

dairying, forestry and miscellaneous rural activities grew relatively quickly. In its limited coastal location, even dairying enjoyed a modest phase of growth faster than that of the economy as a whole. Although one should beware of the performance of agriculture because of its poor showing in 1862–63, nevertheless this technically limited and climatic- ally circumscribed industry also expanded quite fast.

CONDITIONS OF AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH 
even though subject to a considerable margin of error, had an exceptional significance. In these years, but not over the period as a whole, was the hey-day of the pastoral industry. For this earlier stage, at least until 1876, pastoral activity was unquestionably one of the main sources of Australian growth during the period when sheep were allowed to multiply rapidly over most of the readily available natural pastures in the relatively well-watered areas of the colonies. In this opportunity lay one of the sources of the rapidly increasing productivity of the time. 
(b) Even at this stage, however, the pastoral industry did not lack competitors. The rate of growth of railway services is not particularly significant since output began from such a tiny figure in 1861. But manufacturing, growing very slightly faster than pastoral output and also a little over twice the rate of increase in gross domestic product as a whole, was certainly not unimportant in 1861-63, still less in 1876–78. Relatively small-scale and, to begin with, highly labour-intensive, industrial expansion followed directly from the occupational and industrial readjustments of the gold-mining population and from the demand for industrial products of a society already concentrating in urban communities. The high rate of growth of manufacturing and its importance in affecting the expansion of the economy as a whole were the most specific indicators of a quite high rate of urbanisation already in progress. At this stage, a rise in capital/labour ratios in manufacturing over the first two decades made possible considerable improvements in productivity. 
S 
(c) Throughout the whole of the 'sixties, the level of construction was relatively high but did not rise very quickly. After 1872, capital formation became considerably more important in the economy and con- struction activity rose accordingly in a way which cuts across the time- divisions most suitable for general purposes. During most of the 'sixties, at least after 1863, building activity was concentrated on residential facilities and other assets of urban communities; the increasing import- ance of capital formation in the 'seventies was due, in particular, to the heavy capital outlays undertaken in pastoral stations and in railways. The ambivalence of construction activity, in terms of this general dating, is not unimportant. For the first decade, the modest rate of growth meant that labour was not being transferred rapidly to unskilled and primitive manual construction tasks in which the possibilities of in- creased productivity were limited. After 1872, as railways and pastoral works appeared as leading projects, construction activity remained essentially as simple works, suggesting that already the growth of con- struction employment after 1872 may have restrained the rise in pro- ductivity as a whole.

(d) The final important feature of this first phase of long-run expan- sion was in the fact that the outputs of the main services, other than distribution, finance and railways, were all relatively slowly growing. Even rents became somewhat less important components of gross product; but most significantly, public, personal and professional services all fell far behind. The relative decline in these services implied a readjustment of activity away from the particular service activities in which the conditions for increased productivity were least promising. 
Relative rates of growth were strikingly different during the latter part of the 'seventies and throughout the 'eighties. To begin with, the growth of all primary industries other than mining slackened greatly; indeed all, including mining, became steadily less significant parts of the economy. Mining output began to grow quite quickly from the end of the 'seventies due to the development of coal, tin and silver-lead production. Nevertheless, even mining failed to keep pace with gross product as a whole. But the outstanding change was in the pastoral industry whose rate of increase collapsed after 1876 and during 1877-89 was only a little more than one-third of the rate of growth achieved during 1861-76. A fundamental change had occurred. After the mid- seventies, pastoral expansion depended primarily on the geographical spread of the industry into the arid interior. Despite heavy capital outlays on pastoral equipment, expansion of total output slackened greatly. After 1876, the pastoral industry ceased to lead economic growth and no longer provided a major source of rising productivity. 
Displacing the primary industries entirely, and particularly displacing pastoral activity, industry groups primarily associated with urban society came to dominate the fast-growing sectors of the economy. Manufacturing, it is true, had ceased to be the leader of this group of quickly growing urban activities and, indeed, its rate of growth had fallen to less than half that before 1876–77. This fact, together with a definite reversal towards more labour-intensive manufacturing in the 'eighties, led to a further slackening of productivity rates in the economy. Nevertheless, manufacturing now grew very much faster than pastoral activity and continued to outpace gross domestic product as a whole. 
To this predominantly urban component, construction could now be added as largely urban. The construction industry had, in this second part of the long-run expansion of the economy, taken clear lead among the major industry groups. Despite the scale of pastoral capital forma- tion in the second half of the 'eighties, building was primarily directed towards urban residential, factory and commercial structures and transport and other facilities required by a society now changing at an extremely rapid pace into dominantly urban communities. The allocation of resources into this construction sector, with its limited 
22 
CONDITIONS OF AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH 
prospects of improved productivity, implied a further restraint on general productivity performance. 
Closely associated with the process of urbanisation, personal and professional services began to rise relatively very quickly, jumping from the most slowly expanding sector before 1876-77 to the third most rapidly growing group after that date. This change was due to the proliferation of professional activities in wealthy urban communities and to the development of urban service trades. It did not stem from a substantial recovery of domestic service as such. At the same time, rents rose somewhat faster than gross domestic product, indicative of the scope of additions to residential assets, especially in the growth of Sydney and Melbourne during the 'eighties. The fact that these services became more important sectors of the economy was, also, not conducive to sustained high productivity rates.

These growth rates have more meaning in the light of shares of major industrial subdivisions in constant (not current) prices. Table 6 compares shares in two quinquennia, 1861-65 and 1886-90, repre- senting the early and closing stages of longer-run expansion.

single year, 1900. During the three decades of expansion, this table suggests: 
(a) The primary industries, as a whole, became steadily less important sectors of the economy. Not much change occurred in the shares of agriculture and dairying, but the relative importance of mining and the pastoral industry changed greatly. Until 1875-77, the lower share of mining was offset, not quite completely, by the rapid development of the pastoral industry from 8.5 to 14.1% of gross domestic product between 1861-65 and 1875-77. The pastoral industry could not sustain this rise to prominence, and the fall in its share to 12.8% by 1886-90. was an important part of the general decline in the relative share of the primary industries as a whole. 
(b) The striking change over the whole period was the rise to pro- minence of secondary industry from 16-1 to 28.3 % of gross domestic product. This was achieved, in fact, mainly by 1875-77 when the secondary industry already accounted for 25.1 % of gross product. The expansion of manufacturing was the main factor in the growing importance of secondary industry in this first stage, with construction growing less noticeably. After 1875-77, however, the further in- crease in the share of secondary industry was due mainly to con- 
struction. 
(c) The larger share of secondary industry by 1875-77 was not achieved mainly at the expense of the primary industries. It was services and rents, particularly, which lost ground before 1875-77, the former reduced from 42.6 to 36.9 % of gross product. By contrast, after 1875-77, tertiary services and rents held their shares intact (rents actually im- proved their position a little), while the share of the primary industries suffered in this second phase, falling from 29.7 to 26.3% of gross domestic product. 
(d) The dwindling share of tertiary services between 1861-65 and 1875-77, from 42.6 to 36·9% (at which point it remained throughout the 'eighties) was due most of all to the fall in the relative importance of public, personal and professional services, the latter declining from 15.7 to 110%, the former from 8.1 to 5.6%. The relative importance of other services changed very little, apart from the change in the tiny component of railways. 
These changes in shares until the mid-seventies were the simple arithmetic of the initially rapid expansion of the pastoral industry and the redeployment of the goldfields labour force into predominantly urban manufacturing and construction activity and out of the declining opportunities in mining and domestic and personal service. After 1875-77, the whole of the primary industry group became a relatively slowly growing sector as the great investment boom of the 'eighties 
(

CONDITIONS OF AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH 
dominated the course of expansion and as the rapid development of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and smaller Queensland and New South Wales towns stimulated the construction industry and, on a more limited scale, manufacturing and services.. 
The end of expansion in 1889, depression and the partial recovery by 1900 led to a further reshaping of the economy which is of interest in this study primarily from the point of view of the liquidation of the preceding long-run expansion. The most extraordinary feature of the shares of industrial subdivisions in 1900 is the remarkable similarity between 1861-65 and 1900. In general terms, secondary industry was relatively less important in 1900 as compared with 1886-90 and all other major sectors had gained relatively, to restore the relative importance of these sectors approximately to the position from which they had begun in 1861-65. 
་ 
In somewhat more detailed terms, however, basic changes had occurred, leading to a new process of economic development. The whole structure of the primary industries had altered quite radically. Mining had been greatly stimulated by new mineral development in Western Australian goldfields, and elsewhere in Australia the fixed gold prices in the depression had encouraged the revival of goldmining. The pastoral industry was still enduring a curtailment of its flock numbers as excess livestock capacity was worked off and droughts afflicted the industry. But agriculture and dairying were able to expand hand- somely in response to the crisis of the pastoral industry, the commercial development of marine refrigeration and the rising prices of farm produce. 
Despite the decline in the relative importance of secondary industry as a whole, manufacturing actually became more significant between 1886-90 and 1900 and at the end of the century accounted for almost one-eighth of gross domestic product. By contrast, the construction industry had become much less important and in 1900 accounted for a smaller share of gross product than it had in 1861-65. Not for another generation was construction to play a leading role in the Australian economy. 
Most drastically of all, the relative importance of finance had fallen as the financial reconstruction of the 'nineties continued into the twentieth century and as Australian monetary institutions were adjusted to a greatly reduced flow of British savings into the Australian economy. For other occasions, calculations of sectoral shares in current rather than constant prices may be desired. Table 3 of my Australian Domestic Product shows some of the contrasts which arise. This book also gives some explanation of deflation techniques and difficulties.
