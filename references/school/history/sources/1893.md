Free banking gone awry: the Australian 
banking crisis of 18931

The Australian banking system during the latter half of the nineteenth century was relatively unregulated, and is considered to be a good example of a free banking system.2 For example, it had few legal barriers to entry, no branching restrictions and, as we will explain below, no credible restrictions on assets, liabilities or bank capital, nor legally established price controls. Finally, there was no central bank and no government-provided deposit guarantees.3 Therefore, according to Dowd, ‘the comparative purity of the Australian case ought therefore to give us a reasonably fair indication of how well the theory of free banking has worked in practice’.4 
As both sides to the free banking controversy recognise, the crux of their debate 
centres on whether such a system can be stable.5 Indeed, free bankers assert that 
despite frequent claims to the contrary, fractional-reserve banking systems are not inherently fragile or unstable. The fragility and instability of real-world banking systems is not a free market phenomenon, but a consequence of legal restrictions.6 
To support their case, free bankers typically appeal to historical examples of lightly regulated banking systems.7 Consequently, the relatively laissez-faire nineteenth-century Australian banking system poses something of a difficultly for

free bankers because it experienced a substantial crisis in 1893. We argue that this highlights important inherent weaknesses of free banking in that legal constraints on bank risk-taking might have prevented the crisis. 
The paper is structured as follows. Section I discusses the background and hist 
oriography of the Australian banking crisis. Section II examines the regulatory structure of the Australian banking system, and suggests that the lightly regulated system allowed banks to engage in overly risky behaviour. Section III examines evidence on the actual risk-taking behaviour of banks. Section IV rationalises why the Associated Banks and their mutual assistance pact proved ineffective in pre venting the crisis. Section V analyses the policy prescriptions of the colonial govern ments during the crisis. We argue that several of the ensuing policy responses, albeit late in the day, may have mitigated the crisis’s severity and duration. Finally, section VI draws some conclusions. 
I 
During the period leading up to the 1893 crisis, there was a speculative boom, leading to rapid increases in real estate prices and stocks of land, land finance and mining companies. At its height in 1888, the volume of shares traded on the Melbourne Stock Exchange was three times that of any previous year.8 Several contemporaries identified the speculation’s root cause as large capital inflows from Britain. For example, Cork argued that 
the supply of money sent from England was in great excess of any healthy demand that existed, and led to the inevitable land and company booming that inflated the values of almost all properties in the colonies to an extreme degree.9 
The land and the stock market booms both abruptly ended in October 1888, but many property companies survived partially due to the deposits they continued to receive directly from Britain and indirectly through advances received from Australia’s commercial banks. However, by 1891, the ‘zombie’ land mortgage com panies were no longer able to survive as the inflow of British deposits dried up. Correspondingly, the commercial banks were forced to ration credit to land mort gage companies due to the increased cost of raising deposits in Britain. As a result, from 1891 to March 1892, in Melbourne and Sydney alone, 41 deposit-taking building or land finance companies failed.10 
Over the boom period, all the Australian commercial banks had lent heavily to 
land finance companies, mortgage companies, and other companies and individuals who had speculated heavily on the property and stock markets. The widespread bankruptcies of these companies combined with deposit outflows placed a huge

strain on the commercial banks at the beginning of the 1890s. One of the first signs of trouble in the commercial banking sector came when two of the smaller com mercial banks – Mercantile Bank of Australia and Bank of South Australia – exhib ited difficulties in March 1892.11 However, the full banking crisis did not manifest itself until the Federal Bank failed on 30 January 1893. This raised the public’s suspicion as to other commercial banks’ solvency and, starting in April with the suspension of Commercial Bank of Australia, a major panic ensued. By 17 May, 11 commercial banks had suspended, and those that survived faced runs of varying degrees of severity.12 
Although one can dismiss the view of the contemporary observer who argued in 
a rather moralistic tone that the crisis was due to a laxity of principle in Australian financial and commercial matters, arising from serious moral weaknesses within the national character,13 several broad explanations for the banking crisis have been offered in an extensive historiography. One view, due mainly to Coghlan, attributes the crisis to the banks being overwhelmed by a combination of exogenous events, such as: the bursting of the speculative boom, Barings’ collapse in London, the sharp fall in wool prices and the onset of depression.14 Butlin argues, however, that these events were merely turning points that reflected a readjustment process whereby investment was reallocated from the sectors that had led the 30-year expansion towards new sectors.15 However, his argument suggests a relative asset price effect, but it fails to take account of the general collapse of all real estate prices. 
Coghlan and other contemporary observers have suggested that one of the most 
important exogenous events contributing to the crisis began with the inflow and became exacerbated by the ensuing outflow of British short-term capital.16 Australia’s high rate of economic growth from the 1860s made the colonies an attractive investment prospect for British investors.17 According to Coghlan, ‘the mild and beneficial stream of capital flowing into the country up to 1880 was changed to a flood during the five years, 1881–85, and to a deluge in 1886–90’.18 
11 Mercantile Bank of Australia suspended in Mar. and Bank of South Australia was taken over by Union Bank due to its problems. 
12 The ‘Big Three’ (namely, Union Bank, Bank of Australasia, Bank of New South Wales) even experienced huge deposit outflows and runs at certain branches – see R. F. Holder, Bank of New

Between 1886 and 1890, there was an exceptionally heavy flow of overseas capital into the private sector, especially commercial banks, land finance companies and pastoral companies.19 In addition, during the 1880s, the growth in commercial banks’ medium-term deposits (one or two years) from overseas (mainly England and Scotland) was extremely rapid. In 1880, 12.8 per cent of total bank deposits were from overseas, yet by 1891 this figure had risen to 27.1 per cent.20 Furthermore, a large proportion of funds raised by other private and government institutions were intermediated through the banking system.21 
It was widely accepted that, after the collapse of asset prices in October 1888, the 
delay in ensuing company failures and subsequent recession was heavily dependent upon continued capital inflows from Britain. However, by 1890, these were begin ning to decline, apparently due to a sharp downturn in British economic activity. The ebb in capital flow accelerated in late 1890, with the fall of Barings, attributed to the failure of their investments in Argentina.22 After Barings’ collapse, British investors and the British press became very wary of possible structural weaknesses in all developing economies. Moreover, British investors did not have to look too far to spot structural weaknesses in the Australian economy. It had experienced deter iorating terms-of-trade for about a decade, and a current account deficit financed principally by short-term British capital. Furthermore, the main colonies were also running considerable budget deficits, which had mainly arisen from an ‘ill-managed extension of public works’.23 In addition, bankruptcies were beginning to appear amongst the land companies and their backers. 
In defence of the free banking view, Dowd argues that the crisis can be partially 
attributed to the unique nature of the exogenous events mentioned above.24 Yet the ultimate test of a banking system’s stability is how well it can endure or cope with such exogenous events. Exogenous shocks may simply reveal any underlying structural weaknesses in a banking system.25 
A further explanation for the crisis, offered by Butlin and Boehm, argues that 
there were structural weaknesses inherent in the banking system.26 They point out that a substantial portion of bank assets were locked up in real estate mortgages. In addition, many banks had low liquidity standards and had rapidly expanded British deposits, viewing these from a liability management perspective as little different

from colonial deposits. Boehm also argues that the banking crisis was further aggra vated by the rapid expansion of branch banking, which he attributes to increased competition for new business during the 1880s and early 1890s.27 Merrett expands this argument by suggesting that increased competition had a detrimental impact upon the prudential standards of banks, which he viewed as a race to the bottom, fuelled by a need to compete with their rivals.28 Merrett goes on to identify the prudential standards that had deteriorated. In particular, he highlights weak internal controls, maturity mismatches, reduced asset quality, overly concentrated risks, weak liquidity standards and inadequate capital. In this paper, we argue that the decline in these prudential standards and the identified structural weaknesses of the banking system were a consequence of an unregulated banking system. 
Coghlan and Butlin have also suggested that a further structural weakness was the 
failure of Associated Banks of Victoria to lend mutual support to their members at the panic’s onset.29 However, this is not supported by evidence from Merrett’s study, which suggests that the private mutual assistance pact formed by the Associated Banks could not have prevented the 1893 crisis.30 We return to this issue in a later section. 
Ellis offers a further perspective on the crisis by suggesting that government 
interference partially caused or, at the very least, exacerbated it.31 For example, Dowd argues that the reconstructions authorised by the colonial governments encouraged banks to run for cover of a legal suspension allowing them to recon struct on favourable terms. He also argues that the bungled attempt of the Victorian Treasurer to try and coerce the Associated Banks into assisting the weaker banks seriously undermined public confidence. Furthermore, it is also argued that the bank holiday imposed by the Victorian government at the start of May 1893 also undermined public confidence.32 The above-mentioned authors do not claim that these government actions were the primary cause of the crisis as they were all implemented after the banking system was in distress. Nevertheless, they do assert that these government actions were misguided and, as such, contributed to the crisis. We also return to this issue in a later section. 
In the next section, we present our perspective on the banking crisis. We argue 
that the crisis occurred because the banks’ capacity to behave opportunistically was not effectively restrained by the legislative authorities, with the consequence that when the real shock impacted the banking system, its underlying weaknesses were exposed.

The ability of any firm to enjoy quasi-rents at the expense of creditors crucially depends upon the plasticity of its assets – the ease with which a firm’s resources can be redirected into riskier assets. This implies that firms, such as banks, should have lower levels of debt.33 Nevertheless, banks by their very nature are highly leveraged institutions. However, a bank’s main asset is its loan portfolio that is a very plastic asset because of the information asymmetry that exists between depositors and the bank.34 One would therefore expect over the longer term, in the absence of credible commitments against overly risk-taking opportunism, that depositors will demand a prohibitively large risk premium.35 Yet one cannot rule out opportunistic behaviour in the short-run. 
One possibility is that charter or franchise value can act to restrain banks from 
engaging in overly risk-taking behaviour.36 For example, it could be argued that the present value of expected future surplus income generated from the entry restricting role of the charter would be sufficient to offset the bank’s expected gains from investing in overly risky assets. Regardless of the dubious merits of the charter value argument, while Australian banks were chartered by the colonial governments for periods not exceeding 21 years,37 Merrett argues that the increased competition which banks faced from land banks, mortgage companies and building societies during the 1880s lowered their charter value. He suggests that this ultimately led to deterioration in bank prudential behaviour. In this context, the charter value becomes negligible, and banks face a last period problem, whereby gains from investing in overly risky assets becomes profitable. 
Prior to the Colonial Bank Regulations of 1840, Australian banks were required 
to have unlimited liability and were restricted to having six partners. Therefore, the appropriable wealth of banking partners would have acted to constrain them from investing in extremely risky assets. Perhaps because of the need to attract British

34 The information asymmetry exists because borrowers from a bank place a high value upon dis creetness and also because of the inherent nature of banking: C. Calomiris, ‘Is deposit insurance 
necessary? A historical perspective’, Journal of Economic History, 50 (1990). 
35 This also holds for other liability holders, such as note holders.

similar to the concept of charter value, except he assumes that banking has a perfectly competitive

capital, Australia, like many other young colonies, such as Canada, and the United States, introduced limited liability relatively early into its banking system.38 However, a consequence was that depositors and note holders no longer had the credible commitment of partners’ wealth. It can be argued, however, that the cost of adopting limited liability was the increased propensity of bank owners to under take overly risky investments. Possibly Australian banks were prevented from making such investments by supervision from the British Treasury. 
Furthermore, the Colonial Bank Regulations (revised 1846) also acted to restrain 
bank behaviour. The main regulations were that advances were not permitted on land; note issue was to be limited to the amount of paid-up capital; the liability of a banking company was to be twice the amount of subscribed capital; and statistical returns of average assets and liabilities were to be furnished half-yearly or yearly.39 
From 1846, all Australian colonies, apart from Western Australia, were granted 
autonomy in banking and, over time, the British Treasury tended to intervene less so that, from 1862, it no longer supervised colonial banking systems. By then, responsibility for bank supervision had been devolved to the respective colonial governments.40 According to Butlin,41 
the several colonies became masters in their own houses, gradually diverging from the British Treasury principles which had been mandatory, towards a situation in which banks were subject to a minimum of legal restraint. 
For a time after 1862, the colonies implemented the Colonial Bank Regulations but, in reality, they did not substantially restrict bank behaviour. This situation was compounded by the weakening of some of the legal restrictions by colonial govern ments. For example, bank note issue was limited to paid-up capital, designed to prevent banks from over-issuing notes in order to generate funds to invest in risky ventures. However, as can be seen from Table 1, the Australian banking system was

40 ibid., p. 84, states that the British Treasury sought to eliminate all the existing charters from 1862 since the requirements imposed on chartered banks would convey to note holders and depositors 
that they were insured and supervised by the British Treasury.

very much based upon deposits; therefore this note issue restriction would have had little impact on bank risk-taking. 
A second regulation required shareholder liability to be unlimited for note issue 
and at least twice the amount of paid-up capital for all other public liabilities.42 One of the benefits of limited liability is that it facilitates liquidity in firm ownership.43 However, with an extended liability provision, such shares would have a propensity to be transferred quickly to those having insufficient wealth to meet any obligations in the event of bankruptcy.44 Notably, H. G. Turner, chairman of Commercial Bank, when announcing the bank’s reconstruction, highlighted the ‘pernicious influence which the responsibility of the uncalled capital exercises in periods of financial panic’.45 Certainly, the evidence suggests that before the suspension, share holders of the Commercial were ‘rushing their shares on the market and sacrificing them at any price obtainable’.46 This is somewhat ironic in that ‘before the crisis the uncalled capital was generally considered a sign to depositors of the strength and safety of the bank’.47 
A third restriction placed on banks was that they were not permitted to make 
advances on real estate. The rationale was that it limited a bank’s ability to invest in an asset that, historically, had proved to be very risky.48 Nevertheless, by the 1850s, legal ingenuity had managed to circumvent the limitations placed on making such advances49 and, in Victoria, the limitations were completely removed in 1888 because they were believed to be ineffectual.50 
In this section, it has been argued that the regulatory system existing in the 
Australian colonies prior to 1893 was insufficient to prevent banks from becoming overly risk-prone. This lack of restraint upon banks was exposed when the banking system proved unable to survive the impact of the economic shock that hit it in the early 1890s. As Butlin rightly states, ‘in legal terms the stage was being set for the reckless banking of the eighties and the disasters of the nineties’.51 
III 
As noted above, Australian banks operated within a regulatory environment that allowed their managements to overextend their institutions if they so desired by 
42 In 1863, Queensland and Victoria passed laws that included the principle of unlimited liability for banks’ note issues. Similar legislation was passed in New South Wales in 1874.

increasing deposits, reducing the level of liquid reserves held against deposits and by investing large proportions of their loan portfolio in exceptionally risky assets. Below we examine Australian banks’ structural weaknesses, which have been highlighted previously by Butlin, Merrett and especially Boehm,52 through recon stituting individual bank balance sheet data to identify their sources in the free banking era. In particular, we contrast the differences in certain key characteristics between surviving banks and those that collapsed. 
From Table 1, it can be seen that from 1862 there was a substantial increase in 
deposits as a percentage of total assets. Also, from 1862, more and more deposits bore interest, and this helped attract deposits.53 Bankers also competed for deposits through establishing branches. Figure 1 shows the substantial increase in their number during the 30 years before the crisis. Furthermore, some banks actually hired touting agents in order to increase their deposit issue.54 Table 2 highlights several characteristics of Australian banks prior to the crisis. From it we see that the banks that failed or suspended had on average a greater number of branches than those which survived. 
Another way Australian banks sought to increase their deposit issue was to attract 
deposits from the United Kingdom. The growth of British deposits in Australian banks is shown in Table 3. Several commentators have viewed the huge amount of United Kingdom deposits in the Australian banking system as one of its great weaknesses.55 Significantly, there is a noticeable difference between the two sets of banks in Table 2 regarding deposits obtained from the United Kingdom.

average amount of British deposits held by banks that failed or suspended was considerably higher than that for those which survived.56 
While it is possible to offset any increased risk stemming from an increase in 
deposit issue through a corresponding increase in shareholder capital, Figure 2 demonstrates for the overall banking system that the ratio of shareholders’ capital to deposits fell quite rapidly after the British Treasury ceased supervising Australian banks.57 Notably, as can be seen from Table 2, the average equity:deposits ratio for

the surviving banks was significantly higher than that of the banks which failed or suspended. 
Another indicator of increased exposure to risk in the banking system prior to 
the crisis is shown in Figure 3, which displays a decrease in the average bank’s liquidity ratio, with the obvious consequence that the cost of satisfying any sharp increase in deposit outflows increased dramatically. Furthermore, the evidence from Table 2 demonstrates that the banks that suspended or failed had substantially lower levels of liquid reserves than those that survived. 
As well as being exposed to increased risk in the manner described, there is 
evidence suggesting that Australian bank managements were also imprudent in their lending activities. For example, it is a widely held view that the banks had lent too much against land, property and shares.58 Peel estimates that in 1890–92, 20 per cent of bank advances comprised loans on land and property and 67 per cent were against pastoral securities.59 The ensuing rapid fall in the values of these types of securities during the late 1880s would have led to a severe escalation in the amount of loan defaults. Not only had banks lent on over-inflated property values but they had also made advances to individual speculators and firms that were investing in real estate and shares.60 For example, Commercial Bank, one of the largest banks to fail, had lent substantial amounts to the principal Melbourne building societies, several of the large land development companies, e.g. Henry Arnold & Co., Colonial Investment and Agency Co., and individual land speculators, such as Thomas Bent, Edward Latham, J. A. Kitchen and Abraham Kozminsky.61 
Nathaniel Cork visited Australia immediately after the crisis of 1893, and states 
that many banks had lent heavily to real estate companies which had recklessly

speculated in land and securities. Quoting a colonial banker, Cork captured the speculative fever that had gripped the banks before 1893: 
In Melbourne more particularly the spirit of speculation ran mad, and financiers and adven turers of every kind had a regular carnival of dissipation with other people’s money: obtained with too little difficulty from the Melbourne banks many of which, unfortunately for themselves and the country, were driven into advancing on unimproved land, yielding no income, and dead securities of all kinds by the keen competition that existed between them.62 
An apparent anomaly is that the three largest banks – Bank of Australasia, Bank of New South Wales and Union Bank – did not fail.63 One possible reason for this that we address in section V is that, in the midst of the crisis, their notes were made legal tender.64 A second explanation is that these banks had their head offices outside Victoria, had Australia-wide banking networks and, therefore, had more diversified loan portfolios. According to Merrett, these banks did not have an undue concen tration of loans in Victoria, the colony most severely affected by the huge fall in property and security prices.65 In contrast to the ‘Big Three’, Table 2 indicates that, of the banks that failed or suspended, on average 47.1 per cent of the loan portfolio comprised loans extended in Victoria. Although the Australasian had 42 per cent of its loan portfolio in Victoria, Union had only 24.3 per cent and Bank of New South Wales a mere 17.5 per cent.66 
IV 
A recent article by Merrett presents evidence challenging the traditional view that the banking collapse of April and May 1893 could have been avoided had the Associated Banks bailed out the Commercial Bank of Australia.67 The Associated Banks of Victoria was a coalition of private banks, initially set up to coordinate and divide the finances of the colonial governments.68 The colonial governments only

68 The fact that the Associated Banks held government deposits may have led depositors to believe that the government guaranteed the solvency of the Associated Banks. For example, Federal Bank 
advertised itself as joint bankers to the government of Victoria. However, the colonial governments 
had first lien on the assets of a defaulting bank, which meant that the governments were not overly 
concerned about the solvency of particular banks.

deposited with banks that had been ‘associated’ for the purpose.69 Some economists have argued that banking systems, similar to the Australian, which have cooperative arrangements between private banks are less likely to experience a banking crisis because their constituents have an incentive to self-regulate and provide financial assistance in times of need.70 
Before the crisis year of 1893, the managements of the Associated Banks 
announced that they were ‘willing to render financial assistance to each other on such terms and to such an extent as may seem justifiable to each of them, if and when the occasion arises’.71 According to Merrett, the Associated Banks’ manage ments also contemplated assisting non-member banks that met certain conditions.72 Mercantile Bank’s failure in 1892 prompted the Treasurer of Victoria to coerce the Associated Banks to make a publicly declared agreement that they would offer mutual assistance to any of their members. Yet, according to Coghlan, ‘this agree ment, as it happened, meant very little, but it pleased the people to feel that the banks were standing shoulder to shoulder’.73 However, the declaration proved ineffective with the failure in January 1893 of Federal Bank, a member of the Associated Banks but which was allowed to fail without receiving any mutual assistance. The lack of support extended to the Federal by the Associated Banks was condemned at the time by many as instrumental in ultimately undermining confidence in the mutual assistance pact.74 
Following the Federal’s failure, the Associated Banks tried to restore public 
confidence in them by declaring that their mutual assistance pact was secure and alleging that the Federal had not requested assistance.75 Nevertheless, it was apparent to the Treasurer of Victoria that public confidence in the banking system had irreversibly weakened with the failure of the Federal. Consequently, he pressurised the Associated Banks into publicly declaring on 14 March 1893 that 
the associated banks have agreed to act unitedly in tendering financial assistance to each other should such be required, and that the Government of Victoria have resolved to afford their cordial co-operation.76 
Yet it was an open secret that the colony’s Premier had not endorsed the Treasurer’s statement.77 Furthermore, Bank of Australasia, which had not been represented at

the negotiations resulting in this statement, required a further statement to be issued clarifying that ‘banks would assist one another to such an extent as to each might seem fit’.78 Both the above factors undermined the credibility of the mutual assist ance pact with the banking public. A few weeks later, any remaining confidence was dissipated by the refusal of the Associated Banks to bail out Commercial Bank of Australia. 
Although much of the contemporary press79 believed that the Associated Banks 
were partially responsible for the ensuing panic, the failure of the mutual assistance pact is not surprising, given Merrett’s findings that the Associated Banks simply did not have enough funds to engage in a wholesale bailout.80 On this basis, he goes on to argue that such a rescue would most likely have led to the collapse of all the member banks. More fundamentally, Goodhart81 convincingly argues that a private competitor would be unable to undertake effectively central-banking functions because of conflicts of interest. Indeed, as Pope argues in regard to the Australian context, banks have huge incentives not to bail out other banks because they stand to gain market share.82 Barings’ guarantee in Britain was successful not because of a mutual assistance pact, but because the Bank of England took the lead and then coerced the main commercial banks to extend financial assistance.83 The Australian banking system simply lacked the institutional apparatus to bail out banks.84

Dowd has argued that government intervention partially caused or, at the very least, exacerbated the 1893 banking crisis.85 In this section, we explore this claim by appraising government interventions that took place during the crisis. The interventions include: the financial reconstructions, the Victorian bank holiday and various measures taken by the government of New South Wales. In contrast to Dowd, we conclude that some of these interventions may have actually mitigated the severity of the crisis. 
The majority of banks that suspended were permitted to engage in financial 
reconstruction by converting some deposits into preference shares, converting some short-term deposits into long-term fixed deposits and raising new capital from shareholders. Dowd argues that the permission given by the colonial governments allowing the banks to reconstruct made it difficult for depositors to liquidate banks.86

Furthermore, it was argued by The Economist that in order for a free market econ omy to function efficiently, liquidation should not be hindered by government interference and, based on this premise, it was maintained that the suspended banks should have been liquidated.87 It is also argued that the reconstruction mania may have forced some of the more established banks to suspend.88 Undoubtedly, the nature of the reconstructions meant that there were costs borne by depositors and shareholders, implying that there would have been no long-term malincentives associated with the reconstructions. However, liquidation may not have been poss ible because bank assets and collateral were unsaleable, and may even have had near zero values due to fire-sale losses.89 Furthermore, the banking system survived, which is the ultimate test of the efficacy of the reconstruction policy. Indeed, it was recognised by many depositors that the reconstructions were the best outcome that they could achieve.90 
A second government response to the crisis was the declaration made by the 
Victorian government of a five-day bank holiday on Monday, 1 May 1893. The Premier had declared the bank holiday after hearing that National Bank was about to suspend. He had hoped that the holiday would calm depositors’ excitement but, instead, depositor excitement ‘rose to fever heat, and it was hastily assumed that all the banks would have had to suspend had it not been for the government’s inter vention’.91 The adverse effect of the holiday led the ‘Big Three’ to remain open with several other banks following suit. In this way, one can argue that the sounder banks were able to identify themselves to the banking public, while those that stayed closed were seen as unsound. The adverse effect of the bank holiday policy can only have further undermined depositor confidence because ‘the public became concerned chiefly at the incapacity of its rulers during so grave a crisis’.92 
The Victorian government had been urged as early as January 1893 to make bank 
notes legal tender and to give a partial deposit guarantee. However, it ignored these suggestions. In contrast, the New South Wales government in May 1893 passed three measures applicable only to banks with their head office in New South Wales. Their success led to Sir George Dibbs, the Colonial Secretary, being praised by the public and banks for ‘the promptness and energy with which the government had introduced legislative measures for the restoration of public confidence during the recent financial crisis’.93 Indeed, the actions of the New South Wales government

may have actually prevented the ‘Big Three’ from failing and the crisis deteriorating even further. 
The first measure assented to on 3 May 1893 was the Bank Issue Act which made 
bank notes a first charge on assets, gave the Governor of New South Wales power to declare bank notes legal tender and granted the government the right to inspect banks. Initially, this Act was not forced upon the banks but Coghlan was sent to encourage the five major banks operating in the colony jointly to accept the Act. However, only one bank wanted its notes made legal tender.94 Yet, on 15 May, as soon as the government learnt of the impending suspension of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, it declared the notes of the following banks to be legal tender whether their managements wanted it or not – Bank of Australiasia, Bank of New South Wales, City Bank of Sydney and Union Bank. This meant that these banks could print notes to cover their deposit outflows. They were acceptable to the public because they had legal tender status, were a first charge on assets and the designated banks had been vetted before legal tender status was conferred. It is interesting to note that none actually failed. Indeed, Coghlan states that, within a couple of days, deposit withdrawals had ceased and the crisis was brought to an end.95 
The second measure that the New South Wales government passed in late May 
1893 was the Current Account Depositors Act. This empowered the government to advance to current account depositors 50 per cent of the sums owing to them by the suspended banks.96 The advances took the form of Treasury notes with legal tender status. This enabled commercial life to continue in some form, and reduced the strain upon the ‘Big Three’. According to Shann,97 ‘this was the traditional policy of choking a panic with cash’. It was argued at the time that the Current Account Depositors Act and declaring bank notes legal tender ‘theoretically objec tionable as they may be, saved further disasters of such possible magnitude as would have involved the insolvency of the colonies within a measurable time’.98 A third measure taken by the New South Wales government to help calm the crisis was the declaration made by the Colonial Secretary that no other banks with their head office in New South Wales would be permitted to fail. The government was willing to act as a lender of last resort if necessary. The declaration was made by the Colonial Secretary following the collapse of Australian Joint Stock Bank on 21 April 1893.99

financial crisis.’

Indeed, Sir George Dibbs, the Colonial Secretary, argued that such a measure should have been passed a quarter of a century earlier. The credibility of this declaration would have been somewhat undermined by the failure of the colonial government to prevent the suspension of Commercial Banking Company of Sydney in mid-May 1893. However, credibility would have been strengthened by imposing the Bank Issue Act upon the banks, and by the passing of the Current Account Depositors Act. 
On the strength of the measures taken by the New South Wales government and 
their effect, depositors of banks headquartered in New South Wales would have become more assured as to the safety of their deposits. Significantly, the banking crisis in New South Wales was not as severe as that in Victoria. Therefore, an interesting issue is whether the Victorian government could have ameliorated the severity of the crisis had it adopted policies similar to those of the government of New South Wales.100 Correspondingly, one can also speculate whether the crisis would have occurred had such policies been adopted by both governments immediately after the failure of the Federal in January 1893.101 
VI 
The pre-1893 Australian banking system, which we have noted as being relatively unregulated, provides an interesting test of the view that free banking systems are stable. We have presented evidence that suggests that Australian banks opportun istically diverted dramatically increased deposits into overly risky assets without corresponding increases in equity capital. The subsequent banking crisis, precipi tated by the crisis in the real economy, appears from the evidence to be a natural consequence of the system of free banking. 
We have also argued that the intervention undertaken by the New South Wales 
government, once the crisis had begun, mitigated its impact. In particular, we noted the declared intention of this government to act as a lender of last resort. Indeed, one can hypothesise whether or not such a declaration ex ante would have prevented the crisis occurring in the first instance. Notably, this absence of a lender of last resort was commented upon by several contemporary English bankers: 
The Australian banks do not possess, as those in this country do, a great central institution from which sources of supply in the form of legal-tender may be obtained ... the advantage of a central bank, equipped as the Bank of England is, is of great service in time of pressure.102 
Interestingly, like Australia, several other nineteenth-century limited-liability bank ing systems did not have an official lender of last resort. Typically in these systems, 
100 Shann, Economic History of Australia, pp. 333–4, argues that Victoria’s political leaders were inept during the crisis, whereas the Government of NSW made ‘quality decisions’.

note issue was restricted to a certain proportion of paid-up capital, banks were required to hold a minimum amount of capital and, sometimes, banks were restric ted as to the type of assets in which they could invest.103 In the case of Australia, restrictions on investment in land were not enforced, and note issue restrictions had little impact upon bank behaviour because deposits were by far the main liability of Australian banks. If Australian banks had their deposit issue limited to some pro portion of paid-up capital, then the banks may have had incentives not to over issue deposits and invest the proceeds in risky assets. Indeed, several banking systems in the nineteenth century actually restricted deposit issue, and these systems remained free of Australia-type banking crises.104 In contrast, several other limited liability systems in the nineteenth century were similar to the Australian in that they are commonly recognised as operating within an unregulated environment and as having no lender of last resort – Belgium, Italy and Mexico.105 They also shared the similar fate of experiencing a major banking crisis. Paradoxically, there have been several other free banking systems that have not experienced significant banking crises, the most notable being Scotland106 but, on closer inspection, the banks in these episodes typically were restricted to unlimited liability status. 
After the 1893 crisis, proposals were made for the creation of state banks and 
uniform banking laws throughout all the colonies, but no action ensued possibly because legislators desired to wait until political federation at the turn of the cen tury.107 However, it was not until 1910 that the Commonwealth government permitted the Treasury to issue convertible notes whilst, simultaneously, imposing a tax on the note issues of all other banks, effectively ending private bank note issue.108 The government also established the Commonwealth Bank in 1911 and,

by the Second World War, this bank had come to perform central banking functions.109 
Despite all these changes, there was no legislation enacted to regulate bank 
behaviour until the Second World War, implying that banks still operated in a relatively unregulated environment. Despite this, during the decades following 1893, banks became increasingly conservative in that they invested heavily in short term liquid investments.110 Merrett conjectures that this increase in prudential strength was due to increased competition from the public sector banks, such as the state savings banks, agricultural banks and Commonwealth Bank of Australia.111 
One can also argue that, after the crisis, there was an expectation that the 
governing authorities would continue to act as a lender of last resort. Therefore, it is seemingly paradoxical that banks behaved in a conservative manner, given that they operated in a relatively unregulated environment having a lender of last resort. Notably, after the crisis, the banks had weak bargaining positions relative to the governing authorities and, consequently, were given directives and with increasing frequency after the Commonwealth was established in 1901.112 Therefore, there may have been little perceived need for formal banking legislation as the governing authorities used the threat of removing last-resort lending combined with moral suasion to discourage banks from engaging in overly risky behaviour. Increasingly, therefore, the concentrated and cartelised banking system, that arose out of the ashes of 1893, operated ‘in the government’s shadow’.113
