Talk about relationships between factors. Relationships to other things comparing. What relationships last to this day.

Hard and persuasive. Don't be on the fence.

Resources don’t just fill bank accounts. They shape societies. Gold did that for Australia. It gave the economy its first great push—and its first great fall. But more than that, it set the tempo for what came next.

So we can’t say gold was just good or bad. What we can say is that it was foundational. It didn’t just make people rich. It made Australia what it is. It reshaped population patterns, created new institutions, built infrastructure, and left behind both prosperity and problems.

Investors poured money into Victoria, and the colonial government took out a massive £7 million loan, which was actually used for development—not just spent on luxuries. That’s unusual. That’s institutional maturity.

McLean makes it sound open—“all you needed was a shovel, a pan, some food, and a tent.”
The gold rush may have democratized access to wealth within white settler society, but it also deepened colonial dispossession and gender inequality.

By the 1870s, gold was still going strong. It remained a third of exports into the 1890s. That’s remarkable longevity.
