Here is a revised, critically balanced essay plan with **proportional word distribution** based on the **relative importance and complexity** of each theme in explaining gold’s role in the Australian economy between 1850 and 1900.

---

**Thesis Statement**  
Gold was not simply a valuable export but the architect of Australia’s first great economic transformation. It catalysed explosive growth, drove institutional and infrastructural development, embedded systemic dependencies, deepened inequalities, and left an enduring structural and environmental legacy. Its dual character—boom and fragility—defined the trajectory of Australia’s economic identity.

---

**I. Introduction (200 words)**  
- State the argument: Gold shaped the **structure** of Australia’s economy—not just its scale.  
- Emphasize its dual legacy: economic dynamism and systemic vulnerability.  
- Preview main themes: expansion, institutional change, fragility, collapse, inequality, environment.  
- Assert a hard position: gold was not merely beneficial—it was foundational and destabilising.

**II. Economic Expansion: Gold as Growth Engine (500 words)**  
**Why expanded:** This was the most immediate and dramatic impact—demographic surge, labour mobility, capital accumulation.  
**Main Argument:** Gold created extensive and intensive growth—both increasing population and productivity.  
**Subpoints:**  
- Tripled population in a decade; Melbourne’s population quadrupled.  
- Labour shifted away from pastoralism; rural wage inflation.  
- Rise in real GDP per capita (~32%); export revenue surge.  
- Rise of services and proto-manufacturing to support the mining economy.  
- Role of immigration (including Chinese) in sustaining labour and markets.  
- Low barriers to entry compared to California fostered broad participation.

**III. Infrastructure and Institutional Change (450 words)**  
**Why expanded:** Gold radically altered governance, political rights, and economic planning.  
**Main Argument:** Gold forced governments to modernise institutions and build large-scale infrastructure to manage newfound wealth and population shocks.  
**Subpoints:**  
- Borrowing boom: British capital financed rail, ports, utilities (e.g., Victoria’s £7m loan).  
- Egalitarian mining policy: small claims, export duties post-Eureka.  
- Political reforms: secret ballot, suffrage extensions shaped by miners’ activism.  
- Subsidised immigration to meet labour demand—especially women.  
- Infrastructure design biased toward gold routes, reinforcing urban (Melbourne) dominance.

---

**IV. Fragility and Dependency (400 words)**  
**Why important:** Gold built an economy reliant on narrow, volatile sectors and external financing.  
**Main Argument:** The colonial economy grew fast but on dangerously unstable foundations.  
**Subpoints:**  
- Reliance on two commodities: gold and wool.  
- Foreign debt ballooned to over 100% of GDP by 1880s.  
- Import gluts: per-immigrant imports rose from £45 to £253.  
- Shallow manufacturing sector; limited diversification.  
- Infrastructure served extractive economy, not holistic development.

---

**V. Collapse and Structural Legacy (500 words)**  
**Why expanded:** The 1890s depression was the direct fallout of gold-driven fragility and reshaped future economic policy and structure.  
**Main Argument:** When gold’s boom plateaued, the system built on it collapsed, exposing long-term structural flaws.  
**Subpoints:**  
- Fall in gold output; reverse capital flows; credit squeeze.  
- Bursting of land and housing bubbles; collapse of Melbourne’s economy.  
- Bank failures, mass unemployment, immigration slowdown.  
- British creditors limited recovery options—no currency devaluation.  
- Structural imprint: centralised urban economy, external finance reliance, ongoing resource dependence (mining model persisted).  
- Australia’s 20th-century economy echoed the same model (e.g., iron ore boom).

---

**VI. Unequal Distribution of Benefits (300 words)**  
**Why moderate:** Important for understanding who gained and who lost—shaped socio-economic structure.  
**Main Argument:** Gold created concentrated prosperity while institutionalising exclusion for others.  
**Subpoints:**  
- Indigenous land seizure, loss of sovereignty, destruction of subsistence systems.  
- Systemic violence and restriction against Chinese migrants; Buckland River riot, mining taxes.  
- Women: new economic roles in services and support industries but exclusion from land and mining ownership.

---

**VII. Environmental Externalities (300 words)**  
**Why moderate:** Often neglected in economic analysis but critical for understanding sustainability of growth.  
**Main Argument:** Gold wealth came at the expense of environmental capital, damaging long-term economic potential.  
**Subpoints:**  
- Soil degradation, deforestation, river pollution via sluicing and puddling.  
- Ballarat’s main street rose by over 3 metres due to mining waste.  
- Undermined agricultural viability; scars on landscape persist.

---

**VIII. Conclusion (150 words)**  
- Reassert thesis: Gold was central—not incidental—to economic transformation.  
- Emphasize critical point: It embedded as many problems as it solved.  
- Reflect on continuity: gold set the extractive, externally funded model that remains in Australia’s economic DNA.
