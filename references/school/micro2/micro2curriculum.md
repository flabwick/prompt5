**Equations to know:**
1. **Budget Constraint:**  
   \( P_A \cdot A + P_B \cdot B \leq I \)

2. **Utility Maximisation Problem (general form):**  
   Maximise \( U(A, B) \)  
   Subject to \( P_A \cdot A + P_B \cdot B = I \)

3. **Optimality Condition – Standard Case:**  
   \( MRS = \frac{MU_A}{MU_B} = \frac{P_A}{P_B} \)

4. **Perfect Complements Utility Function:**  
   \( U(A, B) = \min(\alpha A, \beta B) \)  
   Condition: \( \alpha A = \beta B \)

5. **Perfect Substitutes Utility Function:**  
   \( U(A, B) = \alpha A + \beta B \)  
   Decision rule:  
   If \( \frac{\alpha}{P_A} > \frac{\beta}{P_B} \Rightarrow \) buy only A  
   If \( \frac{\alpha}{P_A} < \frac{\beta}{P_B} \Rightarrow \) buy only B  
   If equal: any bundle on budget constraint is optimal

**Diagrams to master (and how):**

1. **Budget Constraint (BC):**
   - Label vertical and horizontal intercepts: \( \frac{I}{P_B}, \frac{I}{P_A} \)
   - Slope: \( -\frac{P_A}{P_B} \)
   - Show shifts (income changes → parallel shifts; price changes → pivot)
   - Required skills: draw, shift, explain movements

2. **Indifference Curves:**
   - Convex (standard preferences): downward sloping, bowed inwards
   - Perfect complements: L-shaped, kinks at \( \frac{A}{B} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \)
   - Perfect substitutes: straight lines with constant slope \( -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \)
   - Non-convex: bowed out, preference against variety
   - Required skills: identify type, draw a map, explain MRS

3. **Optimal Point (Standard):**
   - Tangency between budget constraint and indifference curve
   - MRS = price ratio
   - Interior solution
   - Label A*, B*, U*

4. **Optimal Point (Perfect Complements):**
   - Kink of indifference curve touches budget constraint
   - Condition: \( \alpha A = \beta B \), and BC binds

5. **Optimal Point (Perfect Substitutes):**
   - Corner solution unless marginal utility per dollar is identical
   - If equal, any point on BC is optimal

6. **Classification Diagram:**
   - Graph showing unaffordable bundles (outside BC)
   - Affordable but dominated (inside BC)
   - Potential optimal (on BC)

7. **Comparative Statics Diagrams:**
   - Show effect of:
     - Increase in income (parallel shift outwards)
     - Decrease in income (parallel shift inwards)
     - Increase in \( P_A \) (pivot inwards on A-axis)
     - Decrease in \( P_A \) (pivot outwards on A-axis)
   - Highlight movement of optimal point

8. **Multiple Optima / Non-uniqueness:**
   - Perfect substitutes: all bundles on BC optimal if utility per dollar equal
   - Show example with linear IC overlapping BC

**Other Concepts Repeated/Emphasised (High Priority):**
- Tangency condition as necessary but not sufficient alone (must also spend all income)
- Visual comparison of indifference curves to rule out suboptimal points
- Use of “more is better than less” for ruling out interior dominated bundles
- Use of comparative statics intuitively with reference to budget constraints
- Preference for diversity (convex), against diversity (concave), or neither
- Do not rely solely on marginal utility; always relate to prices
- Always check both optimality and feasibility

**Conclusion (implicit from structure):**
Focus heavily on visual logic, comparative analysis, and interpreting preferences through diagrams. Graphical mastery is central. Algebra is helpful, but not the primary tool. Keep utility maximisation intuitive—optimal means affordable *and* best, with tangency and full income use when conditions are standard.

**Summary:**
This material covers microeconomic consumer theory at an intermediate level. The focus is on graphical intuition, welfare effects of price/income changes, and precise terminology. Emphasis is placed on being able to draw and interpret standard diagrams, apply comparative statics, and distinguish between types of goods and tax impacts. Heavy mathematical manipulation (e.g., full algebraic solutions for CV/EV) is de-emphasised in favour of conceptual understanding and diagram-based analysis.

**Exam-style questions:**

- **Short answer (dominant format):**
  - Derive budget constraint and explain its components.
  - Derive and interpret the optimality condition MU₁ = δ(1 + r)MU₂.
  - Analyze what happens to consumption choices when r increases/decreases.
  - Explain how changes in δ affect intertemporal preferences.
  - Justify assumptions like separability and identical utility functions over time.
  - Apply the model to numerical cases (e.g., C₁ = ?, C₂ = ? given I, r, δ).
- **Multiple choice (minor portion, ~25–50%):**
  - Identify correct interpretations of δ and r.
  - Spot incorrect assumptions about intertemporal models.
  - Recognize budget constraint shifts given changes in r.
- **Calculation-based:**
  - Solve for optimal C₁ and C₂ using log utility and given parameters.
  - Compute how changes in interest rates shift consumption levels.
- **Graphical questions:**
  - Draw and label budget constraints with different r.
  - Show impact of intertemporal preferences on optimal bundle.
  - Graph substitution and income effects from interest rate changes.

**Equations to know:**

1. **Utility function:**  
   *U(C₁, C₂) = u(C₁) + δu(C₂)*

2. **Budget constraint (present value form):**  
   *C₁ + C₂/(1 + r) = I*

3. **Optimality condition (Euler equation):**  
   *MU₁ = δ(1 + r)MU₂*  
   Or, if using log utility (u(C) = ln(C)):  
   *1/C₁ = δ(1 + r)(1/C₂)*  
   Rearranged: *C₂ = δ(1 + r)C₁*

4. **Substituting into budget constraint:**  
   If *C₂ = δ(1 + r)C₁*, then:  
   *C₁ + δ(1 + r)C₁ / (1 + r) = I* → *C₁ = I / (1 + δ)*

5. **Comparative static result (log utility):**  
   With I = 100, δ = 0.95, r = 0.10  
   → *C₁ = 100 / (1 + 0.95) = 51.2*,  
   *C₂ = 0.95 × 1.1 × 51.2 = 53.6*

   - X-axis: C₁ (today's consumption)
   - Y-axis: C₂ (future consumption)
   - Intercepts:
     - X: when C₂ = 0 → C₁ = I
     - Y: when C₁ = 0 → C₂ = (1 + r)I

   - Label clearly: Budget line shifts with r.

2. **Indifference curves:**
   - Downward sloping, convex to origin.
   - Represent same total utility across combinations of C₁ and C₂.
   - Higher curves = higher utility.
   - Tangency point with budget line = optimal bundle.

**Diagrams to Master (and How):**

1. **Isoquant and Iso-cost Diagram**
   - Draw isoquants for different output levels (e.g., Q=1 to Q=5)
   - Iso-cost lines with correct slopes (-w/r)
   - Identify tangency: cost-minimising input mix for each Q
   - Label expansion path connecting tangency points
   - Must be able to interpret changes in wages/rentals on input mix

2. **Long-run Total Cost Curve**
   - Q on x-axis, Cost on y-axis
   - Derived from isoquant-iso-cost tangency points
   - U-shape/convexity depending on returns to scale

3. **Short-run vs Long-run Cost Curves**
   - Overlay SR and LR cost curves
   - Show SR cost curve is higher except at optimal capital choice
   - Distinguish SR and LR marginal cost curves: SR is steeper
   - Intersect at optimal Q where K = Kor

4. **Marginal Cost and Average Cost Curves**
   - U-shaped AC
   - Upward-sloping MC intersecting AC at its minimum
   - Same for SR and LR, show differences in position and steepness
   - Must label all curves, intercepts, and points of intersection

5. **Comparative Statics Diagrams**
   - Before/after demand shock in input space (L-K)
   - Short-run: fixed capital, movement along isoquant
   - Long-run: shift to new isoquant, new tangency, new input mix
   - Matching shift in cost curves: SRAC to new SRAC, back to LRAC

6. **Marginal Cost Comparison Graph**
   - Q on x-axis, MC on y-axis
   - LRMC vs SRMC comparison at multiple Q levels
   - Show that SRMC is steeper, crosses LRMC at optimal capital point
   - Requires annotation of slopes and curvature

**Extra Observations:**
- Tangency between cost and isoquant implies equal MRTS and input price ratio.
- Difference between SR and LR cost driven solely by input flexibility.
- All marginal values derived as derivatives (slopes) of total functions.
- Average cost relates to position; marginal cost relates to change.
- Importance of Q* where AC = MC = LRAC_min; defines LR equilibrium in perfect competition.
- Emphasis placed on production model divergence from consumption: constraint is isoquant (output target), not budget.
- Short-run cost inefficiency arises due to non-adjustable capital; visible in higher isocost for same output.
- Cost curves are policy-relevant due to implications for firm behaviour and efficiency claims in market models.

**Mastery Expectations:**
- Know how to **draw from scratch**: isoquants, iso-costs, cost curves.
- Be able to **label accurately**: all points of tangency, slopes, quantities.
- Be able to **interpret given graphs**: shifts in cost due to wage/capital price change, output level, shocks.
- Must **explain curve shifts/movements**: due to changes in input prices, firm constraints, or output levels.
