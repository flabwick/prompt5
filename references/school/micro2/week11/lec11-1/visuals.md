A 2x2 grid showing the four types of goods:

- **Private goods** (rivalrous, excludable)
    
- **Public goods** (non-rivalrous, non-excludable)
    
- **Common resources** (rivalrous, non-excludable)
    
- **Club goods** (non-rivalrous, excludable)


**Demand Aggregation for Private Goods**

**Demand Aggregation for Public Goods**
