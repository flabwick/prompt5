**Academic Progress Report: Public Goods & Classification Concepts**

**Curriculum Scope:**
The session focused on the theory of public goods, emphasizing key economic characteristics—**rivalrousness** and **excludability**—and their combinations, leading to four types of goods:

* **Private goods** (rivalrous, excludable)
* **Public goods** (non-rivalrous, non-excludable)
* **Common resources** (rivalrous, non-excludable)
* **Club goods** (non-rivalrous, excludable)

Further, it included:

* Understanding the **spectrum nature** of rivalrousness/excludability
* **Vertical summation** of marginal utilities for public goods demand
* The **free rider problem** and rationale for underprovision
* **Lindahl equilibrium** as an optimal allocation solution
* A public good **provision game** demonstrating incentive misalignment

**Timeline & Measured Understanding:**

| **Topic**                                  | **Date** | **Bloom Level Reached**                      | **Assessment Summary**                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rivalrousness/Excludability                | May 2025 | Understanding (Level 2) → Applying (Level 3) | Showed intuitive grasp; hesitant in final classifications; misclassified based on enforcement rather than economic traits |
| Classification of Goods                    | May 2025 | Applying (Level 3) → Analyzing (Level 4)     | Attempted standard classification; errors present but improving with real-world reasoning                                 |
| Private vs Public Goods                    | May 2025 | Remembering → Understanding                  | Regressed by relying on surface traits (e.g. government provision); corrected with guidance                               |
| Vertical Summation                         | May 2025 | Remembering (w/ errors) → Understanding      | Misapplied concept (equalizing MUs instead of summing); later recognized and clarified under guidance                     |
| Marginal Benefit = Marginal Cost           | May 2025 | Applying (Level 3)                           | Correctly executed welfare maximization using marginal analysis                                                           |
| Spectrum-Based Reasoning                   | May 2025 | Analyzing (Level 4)                          | Understood continuous nature of excludability/rivalry; correctly justified non-binary classifications                     |
| Public Provision Game                      | May 2025 | Analyzing → Evaluating (Level 4–5)           | Demonstrated awareness of strategic misreporting, social efficiency, and mechanism design logic                           |
| Free Rider Problem                         | May 2025 | Understanding → Applying                     | Understood incentive failure and linked it to real-world provision gaps                                                   |
| Lindahl Equilibrium                        | May 2025 | Understanding → Beginning to Apply           | Recognized conceptual structure, though fluency in execution and personalization of pricing remained partial              |
| Mechanism Design & Incentive Compatibility | May 2025 | Analyzing → Evaluating (Level 5)             | Advanced questions and synthesis; probed design failures and behavioral strategy dynamics                                 |

**Overall Learning Trajectory:**
The student demonstrates **steady progression from Understanding to Analyzing**, with brief regressions on technical recall. Conceptual synthesis and evaluative thinking are emerging—particularly in later segments dealing with mechanism design and strategic interaction. Further fluency in applying classification frameworks and interpreting public good demand aggregation is advised.
