Angelo and Beatrice agree that vaccine use gives a positive externality on the rest of
society. Theyâ€™re arguing about appropriate methods to encourage vaccine uptake.
Angelo argues that the government should set a price ceiling, so that lots of people
will want to buy the good, while Beatrice argues they should set a price floor to
convince firms to create lots of vaccines.
Who would you support in this argument: Angelo or Beatrice (or both) (or neither).
2. Suppose an industry is operating as a monopoly, but there is also a negative ex-
ternality associated with the production/use of this good.
a) Does the externality exacerbate or reduce the size of the market failure caused
by the monopoly behaviour?
b) Is there still scope for government intervention to correct this market failure?
What kinds of government intervention would you recommend?
3. a) Consider a Common Resource problem. How might you model this as a game
(from the game theory section of the course)?
b) Consider a Negative Externality problem. How might you model this as a
game?
c) What insights might we gain from this alternative modelling method?
4. Smith and Wesson are the only two residents in a small neighbourhood. They are
considering hiring a security guard. The monthly value of the security guard is
$300 to Smith, and $100 to Wesson. Regardless of how the guard is paid, they will
protect the entire neighbourhood.
a) Explain what is the maximum price the guard could charge per month and
still be hired by one of the neighbours.
b) Suppose the competitive market wage for a security guard is $320 per month.
The local government proposes a plan where Smith and Wesson each pay half
the monthly fee. Would this plan be voted in? Would the economic surplus
be higher if the neighbourhood had a security guard?
