Does competition increase pass-through? Robert A Ritz∗ 
In recent years, the literature has seen a surge of interest in pass-through as an economic tool. At the same time, widespread concerns have emerged about the rising market power of firms. How does competition affect pass-through? A standard intuition is that more competition makes prices more cost-reflective and hence raises the rate of cost pass-through. This article shows this conclusion is sensitive to the routine assumption that firms’ marginal costs are constant. With modestly convex costs, market power can raise pass-through (even when it lies below 1). These results have implications for antitrust policy, environmental regulation, and welfare analysis. 
1. Introduction 
  In recent years, the literature has seen a surge of interest in using cost pass-through as a tool for economic analysis across fields including industrial organization (Weyl and Fabinger, 2013), environmental economics (Fabra and Reguant, 2014), development economics (Atkin and Donaldson, 2015), and international trade (Mrázová and Neary, 2017). At the same time, widespread concerns have emerged about the rising market power of firms, as the result of globalization, soft antitrust enforcement, ownership concentration, and other factors (Shapiro, 2019; Syverson, 2019). 
This article addresses a basic question that links these two themes: how does market power affect pass-through? A common intuition is that firms with market power have an incentive to absorb part of a cost increase whereas, under perfect competition, price equals marginal cost (P = MC) so the rate of pass-through of a market-wide (exogenous) increase in marginal cost (∂P/∂MC) is 1. This suggests that more intense competition leads to stronger pass-through. Perhaps most prominently, this intuition holds in a textbook linear Cournot model, with a pass through rate of.5 under monopoly which rises up to 1 as the number of firms grows large. 
Yet this intuition and existing theory literature on pass-through under imperfect compe tition (e.g., Bulow and Pfleiderer, 1983; Kimmel, 1992; Anderson and Renault, 2003; Weyl and Fabinger, 2013; Mrázová and Neary, 2017) routinely maintain the assumption that firms have constant marginal costs. On one hand, this is a substantive economic assumption which

A CASE IN WHICH MONOPOLY COST PASS-THROUGH EXCEEDS COMPETITIVE PASS-THROUGH 
may be appropriate for some markets but less so for others. On the other hand, it obscures the comparison with the benchmark of perfect competition—precisely because it restricts competi tive pass-through to a “knife-edge” rate of 1.1 
This article unifies earlier results from the pass-through literature and highlights their sen sitivity to the assumption of constant marginal cost. The baseline model has two key features. First, to facilitate the comparison with perfect competition, firms sell a homogeneous product and the setup uses a conduct-parameter approach to nest monopoly, Cournot-Nash oligopoly and perfect competition as special cases (Cabral, 1995; Dixit, 1986; Weyl and Fabinger, 2013).2 Second, firms’ cost functions are convex, perhaps due to the presence of fixed factors of produc tion (such as capital) in the short run; for example, firms in resource-intensive industries often face steeply increasing marginal costs as they approach their capacity constraints. Cost convex ity may also arise from limits to scaling managerial talent and principal-agent problems within the firm (Hart, 1995) or from other frictions in financial and labour markets. In short, “because inputs are scarce, marginal cost is an increasing function of output” (Rotemberg and Woodford, 1999).3 
The main point is that, if firms have even modestly increasing marginal costs, the standard intuition can be overturned—and market power actually increases pass-through. Importantly, this finding applies to the “normal” case where pass-through is incomplete, that is, lies below 1. 
The quickest way to see the result is to look at Figure 1. Market demand (P) is linear and the industry marginal revenue (MR) curve is twice as steep. The marginal cost of pro duction (MC) is a constant c up to the industry’s K units of capacity. A monopoly optimally produces Qm < K units at marginal cost c, leading to the textbook result of a pass-through 
1 Weyl and Fabinger (2013) allow for convex costs in some parts of their analysis though much of their treatment of oligopoly reverts to constant marginal cost. Adachi and Fabinger (2018) generalize many incidence results to settings with non-constant marginal costs. Spiegel (2021) derives results on the distribution of social surplus under Cournot competition, also with non-constant marginal costs, and shows the critical role played by the Herfindahl index. None of these papers focus specifically on the interplay between pass-through and market power studied in the present article. 2 While this approach facilitates comparative statics on the conduct parameter, the results do not hinge on the use of non-Nash conduct parameters. Conduct parameters are useful in practice (Weyl and Fabinger, 2013) but subject to critique on theoretical grounds (Dixit, 1986); in some models, the use of conjectural variations can be viewed as a reduced-form representation of a dynamic game (Cabral, 1995). 3 A different model setup would involve external cost constraints in a firm’s (competitive) supply chain but retain the assumption of constant marginal cost for the firm itself; this would instead create an endogeneity in that the extent to which upstream suppliers pass on an exogenous cost increase itself depends on the extent of market power at the downstream. The present article also does not consider the role of input price discrimination by oligopolists.

rate of ∂Pm/∂MC = 12 (= slope of P(Q) 
slope of MR(Q)). A competitive industry, by contrast, produces at capacity, 
Qc = K, so its market price does not change and so its rate of pass-through ∂Pc/∂MC = 0 (= price elasticity of supply 
price elasticity of supply+|price elasticity of demand|). Therefore competition here reduces cost pass-through. Intu itively, a less flexible production technology, with more convex costs, always leads to lower pass through because it makes quantities—and hence price—less responsive to the cost change. Yet this cost-convexity effect can be more pronounced in a more competitive market as it has higher industry output. While very simple, this point appears to be novel to the literature on price theory. 
This article uses two approaches to present more general versions of this basic insight. First, the “within market” approach extends the argument in Figure 1 to general demand and cost curves as well as richer market structures. It derives conditions on primitives to characterize when more greater market power increases equilibrium pass-through.4 
For a softening in competitive conduct—as in Figure 1—sufficient conditions are that (i) the market demand curve is concave, linear or not too convex, (ii) demand is weakly more convex at higher prices, and (iii) cost convexity is pronounced enough. 
For a change in market structure—that is, a smaller number of firms—the conditions to overturn the standard intuition are typically tighter. One reason is that a reduction in the number of firms leads to higher per-firm output—and thus also to greater exposure to the cost constraints that tend to weaken pass-through. Nonetheless, there is a set of cases in which higher-order properties of demand and cost functions overturn the standard intuition. 
Second, the “between markets” approach compares in the cross-section two markets that may have different underlying demand and cost functions. For a like-for-like comparison, sup pose that any such differences are controlled for—specifically, in the price elasticity of demand, the curvature of demand, and the curvature of the cost function. This yields a very simple condition—similar to the classic Marshall-Lerner condition from international-trade theory— for the more competitive market to have lower pass-through: 
marginal cost + elasticity of 

elasticity of 
|slope of inverse demand|≥ 1. 

This condition again always holds if cost convexity is sufficiently pronounced; one example is where market demands are linear or convex (but still log-concave) and firms’ costs are at least as convex as a quadratic cost function. 
In sum, the standard intuition about the relationship between pass-through and market power can be overturned under plausible conditions on demand, costs and conduct. Section 2 sets up the baseline model, and Section 3 presents a unifying equilibrium result on cost pass-through that applies under both perfect and imperfect competition. Sections 4 and 5 derive, for the two approaches respectively, conditions under which more competition leads to weaker cost pass-through. 
Section 6 shows that the main insights from the baseline model also hold under price competition with differentiated products.5 For the “between markets” approach, the above Marshall-Lerner type condition applies with a straightforward extension of the demand-curvature 
4 This article follows the literature on industrial organization and environmental economics in focusing on the pass-through rate ∂P/∂MC rather than the elasticity ∂ ln P/∂ ln MC that is more widely used in macroeconomics and international trade. The condition for market power to raise a pass-through elasticity is tighter due to the higher price cost mark-up P/MC. However, it is immediate from Figure 1 that the main point can also apply to a pass-through elasticity—which is positive for monopoly but zero under perfect competition. 5 This article does not address the classic question of whether firms prefer price or quantity competition (Singh and Vives, 1984; Vives, 1985; Leahy & Neary 2021)—and the role of cost structures in shaping this choice (Kreps and Scheinkman, 1983; Maggi, 1996). Rather it explores how market power affects pass-through and shows that similar conclusions about the role of cost constraints apply under both modes of competition. One reading of the literature is that environments with significant cost constraints make Cournot competition more likely to emerge as the equilibrium mode of competition; this article suggests that such environments also make it more likely that standard intuitions on market power and pass-through are overturned. This article also does not address dynamic considerations related to the speed or frequency of price adjustments.

coefficient to a setting with product differentiation. For the “within market” approach, essen tially identical conditions apply in a model with a linear Shubik-Levitan demand system—where greater market power stems from stronger product differentiation or fewer competing firms. 
Section 7 discusses the empirical implications of the theory in light of recent econometric work on cost pass-through. Section 8 concludes and outlines policy applications. 
2. The model 
  Consider a simple model of imperfect competition between n symmetric firms that nests perfect competition and monopoly as special cases. Direct demand is D(p) and the correspond ing inverse demand curve is p(X ), where p is the market price, X is industry output and p (·) < 0. Let εD ≡ −p(X )/X p (X ) > 0 be the price elasticity of demand and let ξ D ≡ −X p  (X )/p (X ) be a measure of demand curvature. Demand is concave if ξ D ≤ 0 and convex otherwise; it is log-concave (i.e., ln D(p) is concave in p) if ξ D ≤ 1 and log-convex otherwise. Demand curva ture can also be expressed as ξ D = 1+ (1 − ψ D )/εD, where ψ D ≡ [dεD(p)/d p]/[εD(p)/p] is the superelasticity of demand, that is, the elasticity of the elasticity (Kimball, 1995). So demand is log-concave ξ D ≤ 1 if and only if it is unit-superelastic ψ D ≥ 1.6 
Firm i has a cost function C (xi) ≡ [C(xi) + τ xi] where xi is its output (so X ≡  i xi), τ is a market-wide cost shifter such as a tax or common cost factor, and which satisfies C (·) > 0,C  (·) ≥ 0 (where C   (xi) = C  (xi)). The cost shifter raises marginal cost according to ∂C  (xi)/∂τ = 1. Let ηSi ≡ xiC   (xi)/C  (xi) ≥ 0 be the elasticity of i’s marginal cost which, given symmetry, will be identical across firms with ηSi = ηS. This can be seen as a measure of the inflexibility of the production technology.7 
(The model defines the elasticity of firm i’s marginal cost C  (xi) including the cost shifter τ . Many papers on pass-through focus on the case in which the initial value of the cost shifter is zero, τ = 0, and, for example, a small new unit tax is introduced. Then marginal cost is (locally) identical including and excluding the cost shifter C  (xi) = C (xi), and so the cost elasticity ηSi = xiC  (xi)/C (xi) can equivalently be written without the cost shifter. This article does not restrict attention to τ → 0, though its findings also apply to this case.) 
Firm i’s profits are  i = p(X )xi − C(xi) − τ xi. Each firm chooses its output xi in a general ized version of quantity competition. The industry’s conduct parameter θ ∈ [0, 1] measures the 
intensity of competition. Formally, firms’ equilibrium outputs, (x∗i )i=1...n and X ∗ ≡  i x∗i , satisfy: x∗i = arg max xi≥0 p(θ (xi − x∗i ) + X ∗)xi − C(xi) − τ xi . 
Firm i, in deviating its output by (xi − x∗i ), conjectures that industry output will change by θ (xi − x∗i ) as a result. In this “conduct equilibrium”, lower values of θ correspond to more intense competition. The Cournot-Nash equilibrium, where each firm takes its rivals’ output as given, occurs where θ = 1, and perfect competition with price-taking firms where θ = 0. 
Two further conditions will ensure a well-behaved interior equilibrium, regardless of the intensity of competition. First, a sufficient condition for an interior equilibrium is that p(0) > C (0) = C (0) + τ . Second, the industry’s marginal revenue curve is downward-sloping, ξ D < 2.8 The first-order condition for firm i is: 
p(X ) + θxi p (X ) − C  (xi) = 0 at xi = x∗i . (1) 
6 Mrázová and Neary (2017) use the term “subconvex” for demands with positive superelasticity ψD ≥ 0; this condition is sometimes also referred to as Marshall’s “second law of demand.” 7 The assumption of firm symmetry is made for simplicity and is not crucial to the main results. For example, the baseline analysis would extend to marginal-cost asymmetry of the form C i(xi) = ci + μ(xi) (given a fixed number of firms n). Similarly, the analysis would extend to a simple model of vertical product differentiation in which firm i’s price pi(X ) = σi + p(X ) reflects its product quality σi—even if this would complicate the comparison with the benchmark of perfect competition. 8 The model setup with increasing marginal cost would also be compatible with decreasing average cost due to the presence of a fixed cost as long as the equilibrium remains interior.

This says that a generalized version of firm i’s marginal revenue equals its marginal cost.9 In symmetric equilibrium, x∗i = x∗, and so the first-order condition becomes: 
p(nx∗) + θx∗ p (nx∗) − C  (x∗) = 0. (2) 
Let θ S ≡ (θ/n) ∈ [0, 1n ] be an index of market power which is higher with softer conduct or fewer firms. The setup facilitates comparative statics on market power via a change in the value of θ S, due to a change in competitive conduct θ and/or in market structure n. Write p(τ,θ S ) for the equilibrium price (and drop asterisks again for notational simplicity). 
The equilibrium elasticity-adjusted Lerner index L ≡ εD(p − C  )/p = θ S ∈ [0, 1] so greater market power directly corresponds to a higher L. At equilibrium, the price elasticity of demand cannot be too low, with εD > θ S (and so εD > 1 for monopoly). 
3. Equilibrium cost pass-through 
  This section derives a unifying expression for pass-through that holds under both perfect and imperfect competition. The rate of cost pass-through is defined as the change in the equilib rium market price arising from a small market-wide shift in marginal cost, ρ ≡ ∂ p(τ,θ S )/∂τ . 
Lemma 1. The equilibrium rate of cost pass-through equals: 
ρ(εD, ξ D, ηS; θ S ) = 1 
[1 + (εD − θ S )ηS + θ S (1 − ξ D )]> 0. 
Lemma 1 gives a simple expression for pass-through in terms of familiar elasticity and curvature metrics that encompasses various results from prior literature. First, under perfect competition (θ S = 0), the first-order condition (1) defines firm i’s supply curve; letting εSi ≡ px i(p)/xi(p) > 0 be firm i’s price elasticity of supply, at symmetric equilibrium, εSi = εS and ηS = 1/εS . This leads to the textbook result that competitive pass-through ρ = εS/(εS + εD ) is driven by the ratio of demand and supply elasticities—and is never greater than 1. 
Second, under monopoly (Bulow and Pfleiderer, 1983) or monopolistic competition (Mrázová and Neary, 2017) with constant marginal cost (n = 1, θ = 1, ηS = 0), pass-through ρ = 1/(2 − ξ D ) is determined solely by demand curvature ξ D—with no distinct role for the price elasticity of demand εD.10 
Third, under Cournot-Nash competition (Atkin and Donaldson, 2015; Kimmel, 1992) with constant marginal cost (θ = 1, ηS = 0), pass-through ρ = 1/[1 + θ S (1 − ξ D )] is additionally de termined by market structure—as then given by θ S ≡ (1/n). 
Lemma 1 shows that, more generally, pass-through is determined by four factors: the price elasticity of demand εD, demand curvature ξ D, the elasticity of marginal cost ηS, and the inten sity of competition θ S. The role of the demand elasticity εD is predicated on the presence of the cost elasticity, ηS > 0, which is often assumed away in prior literature based on imperfect competition.11 
All else equal, pass-through is always lower for a less flexible production technology, that is, ∂ρ/∂ηS < 0. In this sense, a basic insight from perfect competition extends to settings with market power. In the limiting case, pass-through tends to zero, ρ → 0, as technology becomes entirely inflexible, ηS → ∞, for example, because firms face binding capacity constraints (as in Figure 1). In such a situation, the change in marginal cost induces no change in output—and hence also no price change. 
9 The second-order condition for firm i is: (1 + θ )p (X ) + θ p  (X )xi − C  (xi) < 0 ⇔ (1 + θ ) − (xi/X )θξ + C  (xi)/[−p (X )] > 0, which is always satisfied given the assumptions θ ∈ [0, 1], ξ D < 2, C  (xi) ≥ 0. 10 For constant-elasticity demand, ξ D = 1 + 1/εD, so the two parameters directly imply one another. 11 To the best of my knowledge, the particular way of writing equilibrium cost pass-through in Lemma 1 is a new result. Weyl and Fabinger (2013) obtain the same underlying characterization of pass-through, instead written in terms of the elasticity of marginal consumer surplus.

As is well-known, it is possible for pass-through under imperfect competition to exceed 1. Lemma 1 makes precise that this occurs whenever θ S (ξ D − 1) ≥ ηS (εD − θ S ). Several things are needed: (i) there is market power θ S > 0; (ii) demand is log-convex ξ D > 1 (equivalently, unit-superinelastic ψ D < 1); and (iii) the elasticity of marginal cost ηS cannot be too large (for example, if ηS ≥ max{0, (εD − 1)−1} ≡ ηS then ρ ≤ 1 for any θ S ∈ [0, 1] and ξ D < 2). 
A sufficient condition for the “normal” case with pass-through below 1 to obtain, for any competitive conduct and cost conditions, is that the demand curve is log-concave, with ξ D ≤ 1. This is a common assumption across different fields of economic theory (Bagnoli and Bergstrom, 2005) and is met by any demand curve that is concave, linear or not too convex. 
4. Pass-through “between markets” 
  What is the equilibrium impact of more competition on cost pass-through? Answering this question requires some care because varying the intensity of competition via θ S can, in general, also affect the (equilibrium) values of the demand and cost parameters (εD, ξ D, ηS ) as none of these are necessarily constants. 
Two approaches are presented. First, the “between markets” approach in this section com pares pass-through in two different markets on a like-for-like basis in the cross section, where one market is more competitive than the other but identical in terms of (εD, ξ D, ηS ). Second, the “within market” approach in the next section compares pass-through in the same market fol lowing an exogenous increase in its intensity of competition, as in Figure 1, taking into account any knock-on effects on (εD, ξ D, ηS ). Under both approaches, it will turn out that cost convexity renders the standard intuition—more competition raises pass-through—quite fragile. 
Consider two markets, 1 and 2, with different values of the intensity of competition, θ S1 and θ S2 , where θ S1 < θ S2 . Firm conduct is more competitive in market 1 because there are more firms (higher n) or because rivalry is more intense for the same number of firms (lower θ). 
The markets may differ in terms of their demand and cost functions. Lemma 1 makes clear that the relevant demand and cost conditions for pass-through are given by (εD, ξ D, ηS ). The idea here is that an econometric analysis will control for any differences between the markets in terms of their values of (εD, ξ D, ηS ). 
Direct comparison of the pass-through rates using Lemma 1 yields the following result: 
Proposition 1. Consider two markets 1 and 2 with the same demand conditions (as given by the demand elasticity εD and demand curvature ξ D) and cost conditions (as given by cost elasticity ηS) where market 1 is more competitive than market 2 with θ S1 < θ S2 . Equilibrium cost pass through is lower in the more competitive market, ρ(θ S1 ) ≤ ρ(θ S2 ), if and only if demand and cost conditions satisfy: 
ηS + ξ D ≥ 1, 
which always holds for a sufficiently large elasticity of marginal cost ηS. 
Proposition 1 yields the opposite of the standard intuition: whenever costs are sufficiently convex, pass-through is lower in the market with more intense competition. If demand is linear, with ξ D = 0, the condition boils down to whether the elasticity of marginal cost is at least unity, ηS ≥ 1. Roughly put, cost convexity dampens pass-through and a more competitive market is more exposed it. Importantly, this finding obtains even in the “normal” case where pass-through always lies below 1. 
Observe also that the result does not hinge on the conduct-approach taken in the model; it would apply also considering only the discrete cases of perfect competition, Cournot-Nash and monopoly, that is, restricting attention to θ S = {0, 1n , 1}—showing, for example, that, all else equal, cost pass-through under Cournot-Nash may be lower than under monopoly where the latter lies below 1.

It is useful to consider a couple of examples in which pass-through is less than 1 and the con dition of Proposition 1 is met. Suppose that demand is convex but log-concave, ξ D ∈ [0, 1], and that costs are at least as convex as a quadratic cost function,C(xi) ∝ x2i ; in such cases, Proposition 1 always holds for pass-through ρ|τ→0 of a small new tax, as then ηS ≥ 1. The required degree of cost convexity can be given a microfoundation based on a standard Cobb-Douglas technology. Let xi = Akαi lβi be firm i’s production technology for output, where ki is factor of production, say capital, that is fixed (e.g., in the short run) while li is a flexible factor, say labour, and A, α, β > 0 are parameters. Taking factor prices as given, firm i’s optimal cost function Ci(xi; ki) is at least as convex as a quadratic whenever β ≤ 12 . A larger endowment of the fixed factor ki reduces marginal cost but leaves the cost elasticity ηS = (1 − β)/β unchanged. These kinds of quadratic cost functions (with α = β = 12 ) are frequently used in the literature on merger analysis (McAfee and Williams, 1992). Of course, they also underlie textbook expositions of perfect competition with linear demand and a linearly upward-sloping supply curve. 
To see another example, consider the marginal-cost function with a “soft” capacity con straint given by C (xi) = c + max{0, λ(xi − K)} where λ > 0 is a parameter and K is firm i’s installed capacity. While it is possible for production to exceed capacity, xi > K, this becomes increasingly costly as a strain on resources. If so, for a small new tax τ → 0, cost convexity is ηS = λ(xi/K)/[c + λ(xi/K − 1)] and so ηS ≥ 1 holds whenever the cost-convexity effect domi nates with λ ≥ c. More generally, the condition from Proposition 1 always holds for a sufficiently large (but finite) ηS, regardless of demand conditions and competitive intensity. 
By contrast, existing literature on pass-through under imperfect competition typically as sumes that marginal costs are constant, ηS = 0. Then the standard intuition obtains whenever de mand is log-concave, ξ D ≤ 1. Conversely, if the condition from Proposition 1 holds with ξ D ≥ 1, both markets feature pass-through in excess of 1—but it is closer to 1 in the more competitive market, ρ(θ S2 ) ≥ ρ(θ S1 ) ≥ 1. A familiar example occurs with Cournot competition and a highly convex demand curve with constant elasticity (ξ D = 1 + 1/εD) for which the equilibrium price cost margin (p − C  )/p = θ S/εD is constant—so that cost pass-through ρ = εD/(εD − θ S ) always exceeds 1. This paper instead focuses on the “normal” case of pass-through that lies below 1. The main point is that, with non-constant marginal cost, ηS > 0, more competition can yield lower pass-through even when it always lies below 1. A related observation is that the condition from Proposition 1 that the cost elasticity satisfies ηS ≥ 1 − ξ D is also equivalent to the level of cost pass-through in market j being bounded above according to ρ(θ Sj ) ≤ [1 + (1 − ξ D )εD]−1 (for j = 1, 2). 
To get a sense of numbers on the demand side, the range ξ D ∈ [0, 1] is satisfied by three of the four demand specifications in the influential study of oligopolistic competition by Genesove and Mullin (1998): linear (ξ D = 0), quadratic (ξ D = 12 ) and exponential (ξ D = 1) demand.12 In the macroeconomics literature, Gopinath and Itskhoki (2011) calibrate a model of monopolistic competition and, as baseline parameters, use a demand elasticity εD = 5 and with a superelastic ity ψ D = 6; taken together, these imply that demand curvature ξ D = 0, that is, demand is (locally) exactly linear. On the empirical side, Beck & Lein (2019) estimate a discrete choice model based on a homescanner dataset of a large number of consumer goods. They find that the demand elas ticity εD ranges between 3 and 5 while the superelasticity ψ D ranges between 1 to 2. This, in turn, converts into a surprisingly tight range of demand curvatures: ξ D ∈ [ 23 , 1]. 
Taken together, and acknowledging the differences in methodologies, this combination of theoretical and empirical considerations suggests that demand being convex but log-concave, ξ D ∈ [0, 1] will, in many cases, be a plausible baseline assumption on demand curvature. This has three implications for whether market power can increase pass-through: (i) cost convexity is a (weakly) necessary condition, (ii) a modest degree of cost convexity can be sufficient, and

(iii) a (grossly) sufficient condition is that cost convexity satisfies ηS ≥ 1—which is met by cost curves that are at least quadratic. 
What is driving the result from Proposition 1? Recall from Lemma 1 that a less flexible production technology always means lower pass-through, ∂ρ/∂ηS < 0. A key observation is that this effect is mitigated by market power in the following sense: 
Lemma 2. Equilibrium cost pass-through satisfies: 

∂ 
∂θ S 
  ∂ρ ∂ηS 
  
εD,ξD fixed≥ 0 

if and only if the elasticity of marginal cost satisfies ηS ≤ [1 + (1 − ξ D )(2εD − θ S )]/(εD − θ S ), for which ηS ≤ 1 − ξ D is a sufficient condition. 
Lemma 2 shows that, for modest values of ηS, the pass-through function is supermodular in the cost elasticity and market power. A less flexible production technology means lower pass through—and then more strongly so for a more competitive market. This helps explain why, in markets with a fairly inflexible production technology, more competition can be associated with less pass-through.13 
Through the lens of incidence analysis, these results highlight the role of the producer sur plus generated by a competitive market. In the “normal” case with pass-through below 1, cost convexity is necessary for Proposition 1 to apply; this, in turn, means that the producer surplus associated with a competitive market is non-zero. By contrast, recent literature that employs pass through as a tool for incidence analysis often makes assumptions—specifically constant marginal cost and firm symmetry—that imply that a competitive industry always makes zero profits. 
5. Pass-through “within market” 
  Now consider the second approach: in the same market, with given demand and cost func tions, competition (exogenously) intensifies as measured by a lower value of θ S. How does more competition affect pass-through ρ(θ S )? 
This analysis now takes into account knock-on effects on the equilibrium values of (εD, ξ D, ηS ) that arise from the induced changes to the market price and firm-level output. In particular, it follows immediately from Lemma 1 that equilibrium cost pass-through is lower with more competition, that is, dρ(θS ) 

  
dθS ≥ 0, if and only if: 

ηS 
1 − dεD dθ S 
  
≥ (εD − θ S )dηS 
dθ S +ddθ Sθ S(1 − ξ D )
. (3) 

Unlike in the previous between-markets approach, these knock-on effects may now depend on whether the change to θ S is due to a change in conduct θ or in the number of rivals n. A pre liminary result brings these onto a like-for-like basis as drivers of dθ S by comparing, for exam ple, the price change due to softer conduct as d p 
dθS |dθ = d p 
dθ [ 1 

dθS |dn = d p 
dθS /dθ ] with that due to fewer firms 

d p 
dn [ 1 
dθS /dn ]:

dx 
dθ S 
     
dθ 
= −ρx < 0 and d p dθ S

(b) Fewer firms increases equilibrium per-firm output and increases the equilibrium market price according to:

> 0. 

Higher market power unambiguously increases the market price, regardless of whether it is due to softer conduct (higher θ) or a less concentrated market structure (lower n). In the familiar case with constant marginal cost (ηS = 0), the induced price increase is identical. With increasing marginal cost (ηS > 0), however, the market price increases more strongly due to fewer firms. 
The reason stems from an asymmetry in how these two changes in market power affect firm level output. Softer conduct leads to lower industry output and—as the number of firms remains fixed—also to lower firm-level output. Higher concentration also reduces industry output but— due to the reduction in the number of firms—leads to higher firm-level output for the remaining firms.14 With convex costs, the latter leads to relatively higher equilibrium marginal cost—and hence to an additional source of upward pressure on price.15 
Given the differences in output and price responses, the three knock-on effects on the equi librium values of (εD, ξ D, ηS ) will vary between competitive conduct and market structure as sources of market power. Lemma 3 implies that the knock-on effects will have the same sign for (εD, ξ D ) as these both depend on the price impact while the knock-on effect on ηS will have a different sign given the opposite impacts on firm-level output. 
The next result uses Lemma 3 to provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which— contrary to standard intuition—a small increase in competition, dθ S < 0, leads to weaker pass through in the same market. 
Let φSi ≡ xiC   (xi)/C  (xi) be the elasticity of the slope of i’s marginal cost which, given sym metry xi = x, will again be identical across firms with φSi = φS (also recalling that C   (·) = C  (·) and C    (·) = C   (·)). The relationship between the elasticity of marginal cost ηS and the elasticity of its slope is given by ηS = [(φS + 1) − ζ S] where ζ Si ≡ (dηS/dxi)(xi/ηS ) is the superelasticity of marginal cost and again ζ Si = ζ S given symmetry. 
Proposition 2. (a) Equilibrium cost pass-through is lower with softer conduct, dρ(θS )

14 This is a classic oligopoly-theory result, see, for example, Vives (2000), (Chapter 4). 
15 This effect corresponds to the industry supply curve in a competitive market getting shallower as more firms are added to the market, so that cost constraints at the firm-level are relaxed as each individual firm shrinks in size. Some models sidestep this feature by instead assuming a marginal-cost function with a multiplicative form C i(nxi) to obtain an upward-sloping competitive supply curve that does not depend on the number of firms (e.g., Newbery and Greve (2017).

Overall, Proposition 2 delivers a similar conclusion to Proposition 1: Under plausible con ditions, it is also possible for more competition to reduce “within market” pass-through. Part (a) of the result speaks to higher market power that stems from softer conduct among firms. To get a sense for the required degree of cost convexity for the necessary and sufficient condition, consider the case in which demand is linear where [ dρ(θS ) 
dθS |dθ ]ξD=0 ≥ 0 ⇔ ηS (φS − 1) ≥ 
(1 + θ S )/(εD − θ S ). If five firms initially play Cournot-Nash and the initial price elasticity of demand is two (n = 5, θ = 1, εD = 2), then greater competitive intensity reduces pass-through as long as ηS (φS − 1) ≥ 23 .16 More generally, the condition is more likely to be met if demand is more elastic (higher εD) and more convex (higher ξ D) and marginal cost is more convex (higher ηS) and its slope is more convex (higher φS). 
It is useful to see a couple of examples of cost constraints that satisfy these properties. First, suppose again that cost functions are short-run Cobb-Douglas C(xi) = δxμi with parameters δ > 0, μ > 1. If the cost shifter is initially zero, τ = 0, then cost elasticities follow as ηS = μ − 1, φS = μ − 2 and the above condition for the linear-demand quintopoly becomes μ ≥ 3.29. This condition is tighter than Proposition 1—which here would be μ ≥ 2. The reason is that softer conduct leads to a higher price elasticity of demand, dεD 
dθS |dθ > 0 (via a higher price)—which 
pushes pass-through down (precisely whenever ηS > 0, by Lemma 1).17 
Second, consider the marginal-cost function C(xi;K) = [cxi − ωln(1 − xi/K)], where ω > 0 is a parameter and κi ≡ xi/K ∈ [0, 1] is the rate of capacity utilization (where each firm has installed capacity K). This formulation has been a useful modelling device to approximate “hard” capacity constraints in resource-intensive markets like the production of natural gas (e.g., Golombek et al., 1995). Here ηS, φS → ∞ as the capacity constraint is reached, κi → 1, so the condition is always met if firms are sufficiently close to capacity. For example, if c and τ are small relative to ω then ηS ≈ κi/(1 − κi) = 12φS and the condition for the standard intuition to be overturned in the linear-demand quintopoly is that capacity utilization exceeds 47%.18 
Part (a) also gives a simple set of sufficient conditions that apply to the “normal” case where pass-through is less than 1. First, demand is log-concave ξ D ≤ 1 and is more convex at a higher price dξ D/d p ≥ 0; the latter condition applies to any demand curve that belongs to the family p(X ) = α − βX γ , with parameters α > 0,β > 0, γ ≥ 0), for which curvature ξ D = 1 − γ is constant (so dξ D/d p = 0). This demand family corresponds to (i) the ratio of the slopes of inverse demand and marginal revenue being constant under monopoly (Bulow and Pfleiderer, 1983), (ii) the direct demand function D(p) satisfying a generalized concept of convexity known as “rho-linearity” (Anderson and Renault, 2003; Caplin and Nalebuff, 1991), and (iii) consumer valuations being drawn from a generalized Pareto distribution (Bulow and Klemperer, 2012). 
16 Similar to Proposition 1, the condition is equivalent to the level of cost pass-through being sufficiently low— because of cost convexity (Lemma 1)—with ρ ≤ [(φS − 1)/φS ]/(1 + θ S ). 17 In this example with Cobb-Douglas costs and linear demand the third-order effects on costs and demand are both zero, dηS /dθ S = 0 = dξ D/dθ S . 18 For this cost function, the elasticity of marginal cost can be written as ηS = κi 
(1−κi) [ ω 

elasticity of its slope φS = 2κi 
ω+(1−κi)(c+τ ) ] > 0 while the 

(1−κi) > 0. If c and τ are small relative to ω then ηS ≈ κi/(1 − κi) and so the condition ηS (φS − 1) ≥ 23 becomes (approximately) κi(3κi−1) 
(1−κi)2 ≥ 23 which corresponds to κi ≥ .47.

Examples for which dξ D/d p > 0 (and ξ D ≤ 1) include Gaussian and logistic demand curves (Fabinger and Weyl, 2018, Appendix J). 
Second, firms’ costs are sufficiently convex: they satisfy the condition from Proposition 1, ηS + ξ D ≥ 1, and the elasticity of the slope of marginal cost φS > 0 is also large enough. Equivalently, recalling that φS = ηS − 1 + ζ S, the superelasticity of marginal cost is sufficiently high with ζ S ≥ [1 + (1 − ξ D )εD]/(εD − θ S ) > 0. This is consistent with the notion that pro duction inflexibility also becomes significantly more acute at higher output levels; then softer conduct reduces firm-level sales ( dx

dθS |dθ < 0, by Lemma 3) so that cost convexity is relaxed dθS |dθ < 0 where dηS

dx > 0 ⇔ ζ S > 0)—which pushes cost pass-through upward 

(Lemma 1). These conditions ensure that the cost-elasticity effect dηS 

curvature effect dξD 
dθS |dθ and the demand 

dθS |dθ together outweigh the demand-elasticity effect dεD 

of the standard intuition. 
dθS |dθ that works in favour 

Part (b) speaks to higher market power that stems from a more concentrated industry with fewer firms. While the standard intuition is again overturned for a range of parameter values, the underlying conditions seem less natural than those from part (a). 
The main reason is that the demand-elasticity effect dεD/dθ S > 0 that works in favour of the standard intuition (at least with log–concave demand) is now more pronounced. All else equal, the increase in the market price due to fewer firms is stronger than due to softer conduct (when ever ηS > 0, by Lemma 3). So the price elasticity of demand also increases more strongly—which pushes cost pass-through downward (whenever ηS > 0, by Lemma 1). 
This additional force turns out to be sufficiently strong that for a log-concave demand curve now always dεD 
dθS |dn ≥ 1. To overturn the standard intuition, the necessary and sufficient condition in part (b) therefore relies on the two third-order effects—the cost-elasticity effect dηS/dθ S and the demand-curvature effect dξ D/dθ S—being sufficiently favourable. Put differently, if ξ D ≤ 1 and dηS/dθ S = 0 = dξ D/dθ S then the standard intuition always obtains. Moreover, while ηS > 0 is necessary to overturn the standard intuition, high values of ηS often now work in its favour, unlike in part (a). 
The demand-curvature effect dξD 
dθS |dn takes the same sign as with softer conduct in part (a), 
and again works against the standard intuition where demand is more convex at a higher price dξ D/d p ≥ 0. However, it is also more pronounced, all else equal, because of the stronger increase in the market price with fewer firms (whenever ηS > 0, by Lemma 3). 
The cost-elasticity effect dηS 
dθS |dn is again zero with a short-run Cobb-Douglas cost function 
and a small tax (τ → 0) for which the superelasticity of marginal cost ζ S = 0, and can go either way in general. However, it takes on the opposite sign to that under softer conduct because a more concentrated market structure instead leads to higher firm-level sales ( dx 
dθS |dn > 0, by Lemma 
3). So this effect now works against the standard intuition in cases where the superelasticity is negative, ζ S < 0. 
To get a sense for the condition of part (b), suppose that demand is linear, ξ D = 0, and that ηS = 1 (so the condition of Proposition 1 is just met); this brings the further simplification that the superelasticity of marginal cost and the elasticity of the slope of marginal cost now coincide, ζ S = φS. The condition then is [ dρ(θS ) 
dθS |dn]ξD=0,ηS=1 ≥ 0 ⇔ −ζ S ≥ εD(1 + εD )/(εD − θ S ) so that ζ S 
must be sufficiently negative. For the linear-demand Cournot quintopoly with n = 5, θ = 1, εD = 2, this becomes ζ S ≤ −103 . So here the standard intuition is overturned if costs are moderately convex while marginal costs are sufficiently concave. 
Part (b) also gives a set of sufficient conditions for the “normal” case where pass-through is less than 1. It invokes the previous baseline assumption that demand is convex but log-concave ξ D ∈ [0, 1] and also requires that marginal cost is increasing—but not too much, with ηS ∈ (0, 1]. (In the case with ξ D = 0 and ηS = 1, the sufficient condition coincides with the necessary condi tion.) For example, if again n = 5, θ = 1, εD = 2 and ξ D = 0 but now ηS = 12 then the sufficient condition ζ S ≤ −5215 is mildly tighter than before—while the condition of Proposition 1 is not satisfied here.

To see some bottom-up numbers, consider the cubic cost function C (x) = (c + τ )x + a2 x2 + b6 x3, with parameters a, c > 0 and b < 0. Its marginal-cost elasticity ηS|τ=0 > 0 is positive sub ject to [a + bx] > 0 but also satisfies ηS|τ=0 ≤ 1 ⇔ bx2 ≤ 2c while the elasticity of the slope of marginal cost φS < −1 ⇔ bx < −a2 which is met if the parameter b is sufficiently negative (but still bx > −a).19 Now suppose that output x = 1 (by appropriate choice of the demand function) while the cost parameters a = 1 and c = 0. Then ηS|τ=0 = [1+b] 
(1+b/2) ∈ (0, 1) and φS = b 
[1+b] < 0 
while −b ∈ ( 12 , 1) is also required. In particular, as b → −1, ηS|τ=0 → 0 and φS → −∞ so the superelasticity ζ S → −∞ (recalling that ζ S = 1 + φS − ηS)—and so the conditions of part (b) are always met in the limit. The requirements, however, are quite tight: for example, if instead b ≥ −34 , then ηS|τ=0 ≥ 25 , φS ≥ −3 and ζ S ≥ −225 and so the sufficient condition is then not met in the example with εD = 2. 
In sum, Proposition 1’s “between markets” condition ηS + ξ D ≥ 1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the “within market” results of Proposition 2 to hold. Thereby the conditions for Proposition 2 are often tighter due to the demand-elasticity effect that pushes pass-through down ward when ηS > 0. Nonetheless, due to higher-order properties of demand and cost functions, there are instances where the conditions of Proposition 2(a) or 2(b) are met where those of Propo sition 1 are not. Unlike in commonly-analyzed models with constant marginal cost, the detailed source of market power is important for the analysis of changes in pass-through when ηS > 0; the conditions for the standard intuition to be overturned generally seem more natural for softer conduct than for fewer firms. 
For a discrete increase in market power from, say, θ S1 to θ S2 (where θ S2 > θ S1 ), if either of the conditions from Proposition 2(a) or 2(b) holds over the range θ S ∈ [θ S1 , θ S2 ], then this is sufficient (but not necessary) to conclude that ρ(θ S2 ) = ρ(θ S1 ) +  θS1 
θS1ρ (θ S )dθ S > ρ(θ S1 ). To illustrate, con sider a market with a single firm and linear demand curve (n = 1, ξ D = 0) with slope p  = −β. Suppose that the firm is initially a price-taker (θ S1 = 0) and then becomes a monopolist (θ S2 = 1). Let xc ≡ x(0) denote the competitive output and xm ≡ x(1) the monopoly output, where xm < xc. Cost pass-through under monopoly ρm is higher than with perfect competition ρc whenever: 

ρm = 1 
  ≥1 
  = ρc 

  
which holds if and only if  xc 
2 + C  (xm ) β 
  
1 + C  (xc ) β 

xm C   (y)dy = [C  (xc) − C  (xm )] ≥ β.20 So competition reduces pass through if C  (·) > 0, and C   (·) is large enough. The result of Figure 1, with ρm = 12 > 0 = ρc, is nested where C  (xm ) = 0 ⇔ ηS (xm ) = 0 (as marginal cost is constant at c around the monopoly output) and C  (xc) →∞⇔ ηS (xc) → ∞ (as the competitive industry produces at capacity K).21,22 
19 For this cost function, ηS = x[a+bx] 
(c+τ )+x[a+ b2 x] > 0 while φS = bx 
[a+bx] ≷ 0. 
20 The relationship ηS (εD − θ S ) = C  (·)/[−p (·)] (with n = 1) from the proof of Lemma 1 here presentationally simplifies the comparison. 21 Strictly speaking, this involves a non-differentiability of the cost function around the capacity constraint K. However, Figure 1 can be closely approximated using the cost function C(x;K) = [cx − ωln(1 − x/K)], where ω > 0 is small so that ηS ≈ 0 for xm/K < 1 but also ηS → ∞ as xc/K → 1. Economic theory typically assumes that cost functions are differentiable as an approximation to what in practice may be “kinked” cost schedules (Kahn 1989; Marcuzzo 1994). The present results on pass-through and market power can obtain also with such kinked cost functions—as in Figure 1— as long as the cost jumps occur in the relevant region of production. 22 In Figure 1, perfect competition produces higher social welfare than monopoly even though it features lower pass through. This shows that the relationship between pass-through and social welfare is complex and that any inference on the extent of market power needs to take in account the details of firms’ cost conditions.

6. Price competition and differentiated products 
  The analysis so far has relied on a Cournot-style model with homogenous products that nests perfect competition as a special case. This section shows that its main insights about pass through and market power also apply under price competition with differentiated products. 
Consider a model of Bertrand competition with n symmetric firms that each sell a variant of a differentiated product at price pi. Firm i’s demand is Di(p) = D(pi, p−i) where p−i captures the prices set by its rivals. Demand is downward-sloping, ∂Di 
∂ pi < 0, and products are gross substitutes, ∂Di ∂ pj > 0 (for all j  = i). When all firms set the same price, with pi = p (for all i), demands are symmetrically Di = D(p) (for all i) and so aggregate demand is  nj=1 Di = nD(p). 

Three elasticity measures will prove useful, all evaluated at symmetric prices. First, let εd ≡ − ∂D 
∂ pipDi > 0 be the firm-level price elasticity of demand. Second, a market-wide increase in prices 

leads to lower demand, ∂D 
∂ pi +  j =i∂D 

∂ p = ∂D 
∂ pj < 0 so let εD ≡ −∂D 
∂ ppD > 0 which is then equal to 

the market-level price elasticity of demand (with εD < εd ). Third, define a measure of demand ∂ pi)  ∂D 

curvature as εm ≡ −p ∂∂ p ( ∂D 
∂ pi. Demand is convex in prices if εm ≥ 0 and concave otherwise. 

A well-behaved Bertrand-Nash equilibrium requires that (εd + εD − εm ) > 0, so demand again cannot be too convex (Anderson, de Palma & Kreider 2001). 
Firm i’s profits are  i = piDi(p) − C (Di) and its first-order condition is (pi − C  ) ∂D 
∂ pi + D = 
0. At symmetric equilibrium, the elasticity-adjusted Lerner index is L ≡ εD(p − C )/p = εD/εd ∈ 

(0, 1), where εd > 1. The aggregate diversion ratio R ≡ −[ j =i∂Di ∂ pj 
 ∂Di 
∂ pi] ∈ (0, 1) is a proximate 

measure of the intensity of competition (Shapiro 1996; Weyl & Fabinger 2013) such that L = [1 − R]. For a given value of εD, stronger diversion between products (higher R) corresponds directly to a greater firm-level price elasticity (higher εd and lower L). 
Lemma 4. The equilibrium rate of cost pass-through under differentiated Bertrand competition equals: 
ρ(εd, εD, εm, ηS ) = εd 
[(εd + εD − εm ) + ηS (εd − 1)εD]> 0. 
Lemma 4 generalizes a pass-through result in Anderson et al. (2001) to allow for non constant marginal cost. There are two immediate similarities with generalized Cournot compe tition. First, all else equal, greater cost constraints weaken pass-through, ∂ρ/∂ηS < 0. Second, the “normal” case in which pass-through is less than 1 holds, for any cost elasticity ηS ≥ 0, if demand is not too convex in the sense that its (normalized) demand curvature ED ≡ εm/εD ≤ 1. 
This Bertrand pass-through formula directly mirrors that for generalized Cournot. To see this, using ED ≡ εm/εD and L = εD/εd = [1 − R], the formula can also be written as: 
ρ(εD, ED, ηS; L) = 1 
[1 + (1 − ED )L + ηS (εD − L)]> 0 (4) 
thus corresponding directly with Lemma 1 where L = [1 − R] under Bertrand while L = θ S un der Cournot (and demand curvature ED under symmetric product differentiation is replaced by ξ D with homogenous products). 
  Varying competition between markets. What is the impact of market power on pass through? Begin with the “between markets” approach that compares two markets, 1 and 2, on an otherwise like-for-like basis—by Lemma 4, here with the same values of (εD, ED, ηS ). The two markets differ only in that market 1 is more competitive: individual firms have less pricing power, with εd1 > εd2 ; equivalently, given an identical εD, market 1 has a lower elasticity-adjusted Lernex and a higher aggregate diversion ratio, with R1 > R2.

Proposition 3. Under differentiated Bertrand competition, equilibrium cost pass-through is lower in the more competitive market, ρ(R1 ) ≤ ρ(R2 ), if and only if demand and cost conditions satisfy ηS + ED ≥ 1. 
Just like Proposition 1 for Cournot-style markets, the standard intuition is always overturned also under differentiated Bertrand competition if cost convexity sufficiently pronounced. Where demand is linear or convex but cost pass-through remains below 1, with ED ∈ [0, 1], the condition boils down to a modest degree of cost convexity. With linear demands, it is again met for cost functions that are at least quadratic (for small τ ); a logit demand system can be locally concave or convex (at symmetric equilibrium) but always satisfies ED ≤ 1 so that cost convexity with ηS > 0 is necessary to overturn the standard intuition. 
  Varying competition within a market. Now consider an increase in competition within a single market. Cleanly implementing this approach requires a comparative static on an exogenous measure of market power. Natural candidates are the degree of product substitutability and the number of firms (see also Vives 2008). In general, this exercise is more subtle under differentiated Bertrand competition as such changes in market power may alter the product offering available to consumers—and so often directly affect the structure of the demand system Di(p).23 
To illustrate the similarities with the previous Cournot analysis, consider the Shubik Levitan linear demand system Di(p) = 1n [α − β(pi − γ (p − pi))], where p ≡ 1n nj=1 pj is the average price, α, β, γ > 0 are parameters, and higher values of γ represent stronger product substitutability (Choné and Linnemer, 2020; Shubik and Levitan, 1980).24 First, this system 
has the feature that, at symmetric prices, aggregate demand  nj=1 Di = nD(p) = α − β p does not directly depend on the number of different products on offer; in this sense, the system retains comparability with Cournot-style models. Second, using Lemma 4, cost pass-through ρ = 1 
[[2−R(γ ,n)]+ βn C  ]∈ (0, 1) yields the “normal” case.25 
The precise source of market power can matter for “within market” comparative statics. The aggregate diversion ratio R(γ , n = γ (n − 1)/[n + γ (n − 1)] ∈ (0, 1) increases with the num ber of firms n and with the substitution parameter γ—where the latter plays a similar role to competitive conduct in a Cournot-style model. A preliminary result again brings these onto a like-for-like basis by comparing, for example, the price change due to stronger differentiation as dR |dγ = d p

asymmetry between conduct and structure: they rise with weaker product differentiation but decline with a larger number of firms. By contrast, less market power unambiguously reduces the market price: With constant marginal cost (ηS = 0 ⇔ C   = 0), the induced price increase is identical; with increasing marginal cost (ηS > 0 ⇔ C   > 0), the price falls more strongly due to fewer firms as cost convexity is relaxed with the smaller firm size.26,27

Proposition 4 corresponds to Proposition 2 for Cournot-style markets for the case with linear demand. In part (a), the unifying condition is ηS (φS − 1) ≥ (1 + L)/(εD − L) where L = θ S un der Cournot while L = [1 − R] under Bertrand. The previous illustration of a Cournot-Nash quin topoly with n = 5 and εD = 2 (for which L = 15 ) is replicated by setting the initial value of the substitution parameter γ = 5 so the aggregate diversion ratio is R = .8 and conversely, the firm level price elasticity of demand εd = 10 (at symmetric equilibrium) leading to ηS (φS − 1) ≥ 23 . In part (b), the condition likewise corresponds directly to Proposition 2(b) with linear demand; it is again met where costs are convex C   > 0 ⇔ ηS > 0 but the elasticity of the slope of marginal cost φS is sufficiently negative. 
In general, going beyond this particular variant of a linear demand system, additional effects come into play also under price competition. Direct differentiation of the pass-through formula 

in Lemma 4 shows that: ρ (R) ≤ 0 ⇐⇒ 
  ηS + ED − 1 + R∂∂R ED + ηS +∂∂R ηS(εD − 1)  ≥ 0. 

Just like in quantity competition, Proposition 3’s “between markets” condition is neither neces sary nor sufficient for ρ (R) ≤ 0 to hold “within market”. For example, if greater competition— as proxied by greater aggregate diversion R—amplifies demand convexity (higher ED) and cost convexity (higher ηS) then the result may obtain even where ηS < 1 − ED. 
In sum, the main insights from the baseline model with homogeneous products extend to models of price competition with differentiated products. 
7. Empirical implications 
  This section discusses the empirical implications and testability of the theory. An emerging literature at the intersection of industrial organization and public economics has begun to explore the empirical relationship between pass-through and market power (Genakos and Pagliero, forth coming; Miller et al., 2017; Stolper, 2018). These papers consider a single industry with multiple 
26 These comparative-statics results are well-known for Shubik-Levitan demand with constant marginal costs (e.g., Vives, 2008); Lemma 5 shows that they carry over to situations with cost constraints. 27 While the detailed expressions of Lemma 5(b), especially, may superficially look different from those in Lemma 3(b), they are in fact directly analogous. Note that [−p (X )X ] under linear Cournot plays the same role as nβ Di = −∂Di

regional markets and—akin to Proposition 1 (Cournot) and Proposition 3 (Bertrand)—focus on cross-sectional differences in competition. However, while this literature also highlights the im portance for pass-through of finer details on market conditions, it has so far engaged only little with the role of cost convexity and capacity constraints. 
Genakos and Pagliero (forthcoming) study the relationship between competition and pass through using 2010 daily retail prices for gasoline in isolated markets on the Greek islands. They argue that the firm-level marginal cost of gasoline stations is approximately constant in their short-run setting, that is, ηS ≈ 0. In line with standard intuition, they find pass-through is just below.5 in monopoly markets and quickly rises toward 1 in markets with at least four firms. This is also remarkably consistent with a textbook Cournot model with linear demand and constant marginal cost, for which ρ = 1/(1 + n−1 ) (Lemma 1 with θ = 1, ξ D = 0, ηS = 0). Put differently, taking together (i) the initial argument that costs satisfy ηS ≈ 0, (ii) the cross sectional estimates of cost pass-through, and (iii) a structural model of pass-through (that delivers Lemma 1), suggests that demand curves for gasoline on the Greek islands are approximately linear, ξ D ≈ 0. 
Miller et al. (2017) estimate pass-through rates around 1.3–1.8 using 30 years of annual data on the US Portland cement industry over the period 1980–2010. Their discussion of the institu tional context also suggests that ηS ≈ 0 is likely. By Lemma 1 (respectively, Lemma 4), pass through above 1 means that demand must be log-convex with ξ D > 1 (respectively, ED > 1); by Proposition 1 (respectively, Proposition 3), cross-sectional pass-through is then unambiguously lower with greater competition. Using several measures of spatial rivalry, Miller et al. (2017) find evidence across different regional markets that is consistent with this theoretical predic tion.28 This is the reverse of the standard intuition—albeit driven by demand conditions rather than cost conditions. 
Stolper (2018) estimates pass-through using 2007 daily firm- and market-level price data for 10,000 gasoline retail stations in Spain, with a primary interest in the distributional implications of fuel cost shocks. He finds an average cost pass-through rate of around .9, with the large ma jority of station-specific rates between .7 and 1.15. Moreover, greater market power—as proxied by a lower spatial density of competition and greater product branding—is strongly associated with higher pass-through. This finding appears to be potentially consistent with the condition of Proposition 1 (respectively, Proposition 3). However, as his analysis also assumes constant marginal costs, ηS ≈ 0, the economic mechanism by which competition reduces pass-through may be more subtle. In principle, the theory with cost constraints can explain a “regime switch”: if demand is log-convex, then changes in the value of ηS—across markets and/or over time—can generate pass-through that lies above or below 1.29 
Looking ahead, it would be valuable for future research to use longer periods of high frequency data to study of the role of varying cost constraints—and test this article’s results. It seems clear that, in practice, many industries do at times experience “soft” capacity constraints and that industrial sectors can face “hard” constraints in the short-term. In terms of the “between markets” approach, as motivated by the Cobb-Douglas example discussed earlier, this suggests the capital-labour ratio as a proxy for soft capacity constraints. This could be used to control for cross-industry variation in ηS and thus help isolate the impact of market power on pass-through. 
28 Ganapati et al. (2020) estimate fuel cost pass-through in a panel of six homogenous-product US industries (boxes, bread, cement, concrete, gasoline, and plywood) and find large inter-industry heterogeneity. In their sample, cement is the most concentrated industry and has the highest pass-through (1.81) but they do not attempt like-for-like comparisons between industries so their results do not speak directly to Proposition 1. 29 An ideal empirical test would control for differences in both demand and cost conditions, such as (εD, ξ D, ηS ) in Proposition 1. A typical empirical pass-through study includes demand controls that may plausibly account for variation in the demand elasticity εD. It is more challenging, however, to control for demand curvature ξ D—which reflects the degree of heterogeneity in consumer valuations. This leads to possibility that empirical estimates could confound the impact of competition (differences in θ S ) on pass-through with those due to differences in higher-order demand conditions (differences in ξ D).

In terms the “within market” approach, an empirical test could build on the work by Marion and Muehlegger (2011) who estimate pass-though in regional US gasoline markets and use metrics such as national refinery capacity utilization as proxies for supply-side constraints. In line with Lemma 1, they find that cost-pass-through is markedly lower during times when the industry is close to its (hard) capacity constraint—but do not test for the interaction with competition that underlies Proposition 2. A strong empirical research design could combine (i) exogenous variation that shifts market-wide marginal costs (leading to changes in τ ) with (ii) shocks to op erational industry capacity such as capacity shutdowns due to regulatory interventions or safety events (leading to changes in ηS).30 
8. Conclusions and policy applications 
  Theoretical and empirical literature based on imperfect competition routinely assumes that firms have constant marginal costs. As a result, studies of pass-through and recent applications across fields including industrial organization, environmental economics and international trade, have focused on demand-side properties. More competition then raises pass-through as long as it lies below 1. The standard intuition thus suggests an appealing empirical test: any evidence of declining rates of cost pass-through would indeed be supportive of concerns about rising market power. 
This paper has shown that this logic is perhaps surprisingly fragile. If firms have even mod estly convex costs, then market power may increase pass-through. Much depends on higher-order properties of firms’ demand curves and their cost functions as well as on the precise source of greater market power—softer competitive conduct and/or higher market concentration. An immediate corollary is that the rate of pass-through of a shift in demand, that is, a uniform upward shift in consumers’ willingness-to-pay, may—again perhaps counterintuitively—be less pronounced in a less competitive market.31 A further implication is that “quantity pass-through” (Miklós-Thal and Shaffer, 2021; Weyl and Fabinger, 2013)—the rate of change in incumbents’ quantity in response to a small amount of exogenous competitive entry—may also be higher with greater market power.32 
The interplay between pass-through and market power plays an important role across sev eral policy areas. The pass-through of fuel costs to retail electricity prices and gasoline prices regularly attracts the attention of competition policymakers (Competition and Markets Author ity, 2015; Federal Trade Commission, 2011). A related antitrust issue is the “passing-on defense” by which the damages from an upstream cartel may be limited by downstream firms passing the overcharge onto their own customers (Verboven & Van Dijk 2009). The results in this article suggest that the role of cost constraints may deserve more attention in economic analysis related to these policy areas. Under “tight” market conditions, when firms are subject to soft or hard capacity constraints, market power may be associated with higher—not lower—pass-through of a cost change. 
Another application is the design of market-based regulation toward climate change for which the pass-through of a carbon price imposed on emissions-intensive industries (such as cement, electricity and steel) has central importance (Fabra and Reguant, 2014; Miller et al., 
30 The events of the COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020 may also have led to periods of industrial competition characterized by cost shifts and capacity shocks that lend themselves to testing of pass-through theory in empirical work. Future research could also use the formulae in Lemma 1 for Cournot and Lemma 3 for Bertrand as estimating equations to quantify the contributions to pass-through, respectively, of the demand elasticity, demand curvature, cost curvature, and market power. 31 This follows from the relationship: rate of cost pass-through + rate of demand pass-through = 1. 32 For example, applying the results of Miklós-Thal and Shaffer (2021) to the situation depicted in Figure 1 (with linear demand) shows that quantity pass-through for a monopolist is.5 (and hence equal to its cost pass-through). By contrast, quantity pass-through is zero (and again equal to cost pass-through) under perfect competition as the incumbents still find it optimal to produce at capacity following a small amount of entry (i.e., market supply would rise to the now expanded level of total capacity).

2017). The usual logic, going back to Buchanan (1969), is that the market-power distortion limits the extent of carbon cost pass-through—and therefore weakens the effectiveness of the carbon price (in the sense of the theory of the second-best). The results in this article suggest that this is not necessarily the case, with potential implications for the extent to which different industrial sectors should be subject to carbon pricing. 
In short, prices will be more reflective of marginal cost in a more competitive market but it does not follow that price changes will necessarily be more reflective of cost changes.
