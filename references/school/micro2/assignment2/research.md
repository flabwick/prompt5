### **CASE STUDY 1: Inventory Redistribution Using Store Transfers**

**Location:** Section IV: *The Suggested Model*

> *“Our model is referring to an international retailer... which optimizes the inventory distribution between stores, by defining the store transfer assignments, based on an operation research model program, and taking into consideration store operations constraints.”* (Section IV)

**Point Supported:**
This case supports the claim that fast fashion retailers need **dynamic, data-driven operational tools** to respond to unpredictable demand and optimize in-season stock across geographically dispersed stores.

**Evidence Quality:** **Strong**
The authors present a **clear model structure**, define decision variables, provide a full **integer linear programming formulation**, and validate it using **IBM ILOG CPLEX** on varied instances. The model reflects real business constraints (e.g. stock cover, capacity, labor cost), which strengthens internal validity. It’s not merely theoretical; it is **implemented, tested, and empirically grounded**.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
This model is central to the paper and is well-articulated. It enhances the **credibility** of the source because it demonstrates that **analytical tools** can help fast fashion firms reallocate inventory efficiently—countering purely policy-driven narratives (e.g., that only tariffs can address inefficiencies in global fast fashion trade).

**Relevance to Assignment:**
This case **extends** your assignment by providing an operational explanation for **firm behavior under cost or demand shocks**, reinforcing the point that firms like Shein and Temu **don’t passively absorb tariffs** but respond by **restructuring inventory flows**, altering **cost curves**, and optimizing **stock turnover**. This strengthens your section on *Firm Behavior and Strategic Response*.

### **CASE STUDY 2: Weekly Re-Optimization Based on Sales Data**

**Location:** Section IV: *The Suggested Model*

> *“The model is run for each country, on a weekly basis, taking as input the last week sales data.”* (Section IV)

**Point Supported:**
This example underpins the claim that **fast fashion retail requires real-time responsiveness** to sales trends, implying high elasticity of demand and the need for adaptive inventory models.

**Evidence Quality:** **Moderate to Strong**
The authors assert that **weekly re-optimization** is feasible and effective, and they provide structure (Table I) for how this is computed. While the logic is robust and the model is clearly defined, **no real-world company name** (e.g., Zara, H\&M) is directly tied to using this system—hence the evidence is **strong in model structure but lacks real-firm verification**.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
This boosts source reliability in theoretical terms. The authors logically deduce that **weekly fluctuations in demand** require adaptive systems, which is economically plausible (especially in a market with **high short-run demand elasticity**).

**Relevance to Assignment:**
This supports your section on *Consumer Behavior and Elasticity*. Weekly sales data reacting to inventory reallocations suggests **high consumer responsiveness to availability and pricing**, justifying your use of **elasticity models** and possibly **tax incidence analysis**.

### **CASE STUDY 3: Experimental Result – Five Stores, 20 Items**

**Location:** Section VI: *Experimental Results and Model Discussion*

> *“We are going to explore and discuss the results of a retailer data set instance, which has 5 stores in the country, and working on 20 items… The program is executed within 1min 29seconds.”* (Section VI)

**Point Supported:**
This supports the claim that **fast, scalable optimization** is feasible, even under **large item/store combinations**. It also implies that firms can respond quickly to new constraints, such as tariffs or demand shifts.

**Evidence Quality:** **Moderate**
While the computational speed is documented, the data set is **synthetic**, albeit “inspired from real industrial case studies.” Without **actual sales or logistics data from known retailers**, the generalizability is somewhat limited. However, the computational feasibility of their model on realistic scales is clearly demonstrated.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
The reliability here is **technical**: the model works, and fast. It adds credibility to the idea that **internal firm optimization can be a policy alternative or complement**, which is underexplored in the popular article.

**Relevance to Assignment:**
This case **complicates** the narrative of your source article by showing that firms can use **private tools (analytics, optimization)** rather than relying solely on **policy levers** like tariffs to manage price or cost shocks. Use this to introduce nuance in your *Policy and Efficiency* section.

---

### **CASE STUDY 4: Insights from Transfer Patterns**

**Location:** Section VI: *Experimental Results and Model Discussion*

> *“For instance in (FIG. 3) item 19 is highly requested in store 19… a deep analysis of the product features might contribute in building store 19 customers profile.”* (Section VI)

**Point Supported:**
This supports the claim that **inventory redistribution also yields consumer insights**, not just profit optimization.

**Evidence Quality:** **Incomplete**
The logic is valid—frequent transfers could signal **local demand preferences**—but the example relies on one instance (“item 19”) and lacks **statistical backing** or validation (e.g. is this true across weeks? items?). It’s more a **plausible hypothesis** than strong empirical proof.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
This lowers the **empirical strength** slightly but doesn’t damage the overall model logic. It shows that the authors are **speculating beyond their model’s scope** without evidence.

**Relevance to Assignment:**
You could use this point to **extend your critique**: while operational tools offer strong **profit and responsiveness gains**, their ability to yield **consumer preference insights** requires **additional validation**—e.g., maybe through **machine learning or panel data**, as mentioned in your assignment’s “future work” section.

---

### **CASE STUDY 5: Comparison with Felipe Caro’s Work**

**Location:** Section VI: *Experimental Results and Model Discussion*

> *“Store transfer might be done by some retailers, but it was not cited in Felipe Caro overview paper… from 2015 date of that paper until now, no scientific publication was done with the proposed manner.”* (Section VI)

**Point Supported:**
This is used to claim **originality and contribution**—that the model fills a gap in existing fast fashion operations research.

**Evidence Quality:** **Moderate to Weak**
The absence of mention in Felipe Caro’s paper doesn’t prove a literature gap definitively. It’s an **argument from omission**, and without a comprehensive review, it's speculative.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
This claim slightly undermines reliability if taken as evidence. It’s a **meta-claim**, not based on direct empirical comparison or citation network analysis.

**Relevance to Assignment:**
Use this with **caution**. It doesn’t offer content to directly support your assignment but can be used to **justify exploring this model as a novel angle**—complementing tariff-focused media narratives.

---

### **Conclusion: Impact on Assignment**

This academic article **extends and strengthens** your assignment in the following specific ways:

* **Supports firm response modeling** under tariffs using clear profit functions and decision rules.
* Provides a **realistic case for demand elasticity** and adaptive reallocation.
* Complicates the popular article’s narrative by showing **non-policy solutions** to trade-induced cost pressures.
* Offers **quantitative foundations** to your qualitative critique on **tariff incidence and efficiency**.
* Demonstrates that **operational optimization** may be a more efficient and responsive solution than blunt trade barriers.

### **CASE STUDY / EXAMPLE 1: Fisher’s Skiwear Forecasting**

* **Location**: Introduction, Paragraph 2

* **Quote**:
  “Fisher (2009) argues that, in retail settings of innovative products, a seller can learn about demand from early sales… he observed that the demand forecast error could be reduced from 55% to a mere 8% after utilizing just two weeks of sales information.”

* **Point Supported**:
  This example supports the argument that **demand learning from early sales can dramatically improve forecast accuracy**, which is foundational to the case for **responsive pricing strategies**.

* **Strength of Evidence**:
  **Moderate to strong.** While this is a specific and concrete empirical finding (reduction from 55% to 8% forecast error), the evidence comes from a **single firm and product line** (skiwear), which limits generalizability. However, the magnitude of change is large and compelling.

* **Effect on Source Reliability**:
  It **strengthens the source’s credibility** in highlighting that early sales data can be informative — but the authors themselves hedge by referencing it as one example, not universal. They integrate it into a larger literature base, which enhances robustness.

* **Relevance to Your Assignment**:
  It **complicates your critique** of the article’s assumption that demand will simply fall when prices rise. This case supports the idea that firms might dynamically learn and adjust based on real-time market feedback, which is **absent in your media article**. If Shein or Temu observe shifts in consumer orders post-tariff, they might learn and adapt pricing or inventory, which challenges the static demand-response assumed in the media.

---

### **CASE STUDY / EXAMPLE 2: Strategic Consumer Waiting & Markdown Anticipation**

* **Location**: Introduction, Paragraph 4

* **Quote**:
  “Consumers may exhibit ‘strategic behavior’—that is, making a choice between purchasing the product at a premium price early in the season or postponing their purchasing decisions to a later time in the season when a price discount may be offered.”

* **Point Supported**:
  This introduces and supports the idea that **price responsiveness by firms can backfire** when consumers behave strategically by waiting for markdowns.

* **Strength of Evidence**:
  **Strong conceptual grounding**, but the passage cites foundational theory rather than case evidence: Coase (1972), Stokey (1979), and others. These are **seminal economic models**, so while not empirical, the **theoretical support is rigorous and well-established**.

* **Effect on Source Reliability**:
  The conceptual reliability is high — the authors build on a widely accepted strategic consumer behavior model. However, **absence of direct empirical case data** in this passage means the effect is **inferred rather than observed**.

* **Relevance to Your Assignment**:
  It **directly extends your second critique** — about firms responding to cost shocks. The implication here is that **if consumers expect Shein or Temu to delay price adjustments**, they may **strategically delay purchases**, which **complicates the assumption** that tariffs immediately deter demand. You can use this to argue that **strategic delay could temporarily mute tariff effects** or even invert expected consumer response.

---

### **CASE STUDY / EXAMPLE 3: Numerical Simulation of Responsive Pricing Benefits**

* **Location**: Section 3.1

* **Quote**:
  “Across all 3,000 scenarios in our study, the benefit of responsive pricing in the case of myopic consumers fell in the range (+0.8%, +33.3%) with an average value of +13.2%. In contrast, the corresponding values for the case of strategic consumers were (−13.0%, +9.6%), and −5.6%, respectively.”

* **Point Supported**:
  This supports the claim that **responsive pricing is often detrimental when consumers are strategic**, because such consumers anticipate price changes and alter their timing.

* **Strength of Evidence**:
  **Very strong.** This is an extensive **computational model run across 3,000 parameter combinations** (δ, CV, Q), with **quantitative output**. It doesn't rely on anecdote or isolated examples.

* **Effect on Source Reliability**:
  This simulation **significantly enhances the empirical robustness** of the source’s claims. The scale and transparency of parameter variation strengthen its external validity — though results are still model-dependent.

* **Relevance to Your Assignment**:
  This **challenges the Guardian article’s underlying simplicity** — the belief that tariffs will raise prices and drive down demand. The numerical study shows **even optimal dynamic pricing can be revenue-destructive** under strategic behavior — meaning that price increases (due to tariffs) may **lead not to immediate demand drops, but complex strategic timing** shifts. You can invoke this to **critique the assumption of linear cause-effect in consumer response.**

---

### **CASE STUDY / EXAMPLE 4: Open-Loop vs. Learning Pricing**

* **Location**: Section 3.2

* **Quote**:
  “We observe that the seller’s expected revenue performance actually improves \[when the seller does not learn from sales].”

* **Point Supported**:
  This finding supports the claim that **demand learning can harm the seller** in strategic consumer markets — counter to traditional intuition.

* **Strength of Evidence**:
  **Conceptually strong**, as it is the result of their model variation comparing full learning to a restricted open-loop system. However, it's a **hypothetical simulation**, so while rigorous, it’s not validated with field data.

* **Effect on Source Reliability**:
  This shows **intellectual honesty** — the authors acknowledge that traditional "learning is good" intuition fails under certain conditions. This **adds nuance** and bolsters trust in the authors’ rigor.

* **Relevance to Your Assignment**:
  This **supports your third section on intervention**. It challenges the assumption that more dynamic response (tariffs as correction) always improves outcomes. Like responsive pricing, **responsive policy without accounting for strategic behavior could backfire**. You can leverage this to argue that tariffs may be an **inefficient correction** if strategic consumer delay or firm overreaction dominates.

---

### **CASE STUDY / EXAMPLE 5: Quick-Response Replenishment and Implicit Threats**

* **Location**: Section 6

* **Quote**:
  “The option to replenish inventory close to the end of the season serves as an effective implicit threat by the seller to the consumers in a way that discourages strategic waiting.”

* **Point Supported**:
  This supports the idea that **operational flexibility (e.g., inventory strategies) can discipline strategic consumer behavior**, reducing the downside of price responsiveness.

* **Strength of Evidence**:
  **Moderate.** The logic is solid and grounded in game theory, but again, it’s based on **model behavior, not field data**.

* **Effect on Source Reliability**:
  Reinforces the credibility of the paper as offering **well-reasoned strategic insights**, even if some are speculative.

* **Relevance to Your Assignment**:
  This is **useful for extending your second section**. If Shein or Temu can increase inventory flexibility post-tariff, they may mitigate consumer delay effects. This **adds a strategic layer to firm behavior** not addressed in your media article. You can cite this to **propose that tariffs might indirectly incentivize inventory system changes**, not just price or production shifts.

---

### **Cross-Case Relationship: Spread Effect & Information Shaping**

* **Location**: Sections 3.3 and 3.6

* **Quote**:
  “Spread effect… strategic behavior in equilibrium tends to increase as a function of the market-size uncertainty (CV).”
  “Information shaping… the conscious collective attempt of the consumers to influence the seller’s interpretation of the market size.”

* **Point Supported**:
  These interlinked phenomena support the idea that **consumer expectations can distort firm learning** and hurt outcomes under responsive pricing.

* **Strength of Evidence**:
  **High conceptual coherence** with moderate empirical backing (model-based), showing how **rational agents respond to informational environments**.

* **Effect on Source Reliability**:
  Enhances reliability by showing the **authors understand second-order behavioral effects** — i.e., not just consumer reactions to prices, but reactions to firm reactions.

* **Relevance to Your Assignment**:
  These are **critical to your Section 1** — they show that **consumer behavior isn't passively elastic**, but **strategically responsive to firm strategy**. This *complicates the tariff story* by showing price increases (from tariffs) could trigger **indirect strategic responses**, not straightforward demand drops.

---

**Conclusion on Source Reliability**:

Aviv et al. offer a **logically consistent, multi-method analysis**, with a mix of empirical case reference (e.g., Fisher 2009), large-scale simulations, and theoretical modeling. Their claims are **qualified, context-specific**, and **clearly justified**. This makes the source **highly reliable** for supporting or extending arguments in your assignment, especially where the media article makes assumptions about linear price responses, firm adaptation, or welfare impacts.

# **SOURCE ANALYSIS: "Simplifying the Price Elasticity of Demand" by Thomas Andrews and Cynthia Benzing (Journal for Economic Educators, 2010)**

---

### **Example 1: Movie Theater Popcorn**

**Quote/Location:** *Introduction, pp. 1–2*

> “The class finally decided the demand was ‘price inelastic’ because movie popcorn comprises a small percentage of income and lacks a good substitute... Later, I realized... the demand for movie popcorn had to be price elastic, not inelastic.”

**Point Supported:** This anecdote critiques the common teaching method that uses broad “determinants” like income share or substitutes to assess elasticity. The authors argue these often mislead students into incorrect conclusions.

**Evidence Strength:** **Strong**
The example illustrates a real teaching failure and self-correction, showing how misapplying textbook determinants can lead to logical error. The anecdote is concrete and helps bridge abstract theory with pedagogical impact.

**Impact on Reliability:** This strengthens the article’s credibility—it's introspective, data-aware (connecting monopoly pricing to elasticity), and doesn’t rely on theoretical abstraction alone. The case directly supports the article's central claim: elasticity is best understood via the price-quantity point on the curve, not broad descriptors.

**Impact on Assignment:** This case bolsters your critique in Section 1 (Elasticity and Consumer Behavior). Use it to show that reliance on heuristics (like “luxury = elastic”) can lead to misjudging real behavior, just as the article you analyze does by assuming demand will fall uniformly when prices rise.

---

### **Example 2: Cigarette Demand Elasticity at Different Prices**

**Quote/Location:** *Section “Determinants of price elasticity of demand can be misleading”, p. 6*

> “While this intuition might provide valuable insight into price elasticity when cigarettes are \$1.50... tax hikes have pushed the prices to \$8 per pack and consumption has fallen.”

**Point Supported:** Elasticity changes depending on where the price lies on the demand curve. Goods often labeled as inelastic (cigarettes) can become elastic when price increases substantially.

**Evidence Strength:** **Moderate to Strong**
The claim is plausible and well-aligned with real-world policy data, although the empirical source (“New York Times, May 7, 2004”) is not cited in detail. Still, it supports the dynamic, price-sensitive nature of elasticity.

**Impact on Reliability:** Strongly supports the idea that price elasticity is not fixed by good type, but changes with market conditions. Undermines textbook simplifications and validates the authors' argument about teaching reform.

**Impact on Assignment:** This aligns with your critique of the Guardian article’s failure to consider *where* on the demand curve Shein and Temu operate. Use this to argue that even if their goods were once inelastic due to low cost, tariff-induced price increases may shift demand into the elastic range, leading to significant behavioral changes.

---

### **Example 3: Samuelson’s Wheat vs. Auto Demand Curve Comparison**

**Quote/Location:** *Section “Comparing and rotating demand curves”, pp. 4–5*

> “It is difficult to conjure an actual scale that would make the comparison meaningful.”

**Point Supported:** Slope comparisons between demand curves for different goods are meaningless without standardized units. This example critiques textbook errors in visual teaching of elasticity.

**Evidence Strength:** **Moderate**
The example highlights logical inconsistency in visual presentation, though it doesn't supply empirical backing beyond a critique of diagram misuse. Still, it effectively illustrates the confusion created by flawed textbook illustrations.

**Impact on Reliability:** It boosts the article’s authority on pedagogical issues in economic instruction. The example is analytically sound and directly tied to the article’s broader critique of slope-based elasticity errors.

**Impact on Assignment:** Supports your second section (Firm Behavior) — if you’re critiquing the article’s implications about how firms will respond to tariffs, this helps you argue that using visual analogies (like “demand is steep = inelastic”) is dangerous without grounding in actual data or scale-normalized comparisons.

---

### **Example 4: Rotating Demand Curves Due to Advertising**

**Quote/Location:** *Section “Comparing and rotating demand curves”, p. 5*

> “Rotation is more likely to occur when advertising contains real information about a specialized product... only two \[textbooks] contain figures... due to advertising.”

**Point Supported:** Rotating demand curves (changing slope) are too complex for introductory elasticity discussions and often confuse students.

**Evidence Strength:** **Weak to Moderate**
The claim about advertising's effect on rotation is plausible and cited (Johnson & Myatt, Meyerhoefer & Zuvekas), but the link to elasticity pedagogy is speculative. The authors argue these examples are inappropriate for principles-level teaching rather than proving their inaccuracy.

**Impact on Reliability:** This is less central to the article’s main thesis and doesn’t undermine it, but it does highlight where the authors may be overextending. It reflects a well-intended caution but lacks direct data to prove harm in the classroom.

**Impact on Assignment:** Low direct relevance. However, you might briefly use it in your Section 3 to caution against overstating the simplicity of market shifts (e.g., resale markets becoming dominant) without considering whether the behavioral model justifies that change in slope or demand structure.

---

### **Example 5: Elasticity Differences in Cigarette Markets (Teens vs Adults)**

**Quote/Location:** *Section “Use two demand curves…”, p. 8*

> “Adolescents have the inside demand curve (D1) and adults have the outside demand curve (D2)... At a uniform price, the outside curve will be more inelastic.”

**Point Supported:** Different consumer segments can face different elasticities even for the same product. Demand segmentation matters, and using separate curves avoids slope confusion.

**Evidence Strength:** **Strong**
This is conceptually sound, matches market behavior (income sensitivity, preferences), and is consistent with empirical work on youth smoking demand. It visually and analytically supports the authors’ framework.

**Impact on Reliability:** Strongly supports the article’s message: price elasticity should be taught via curve position, not slope. This shows the richness of elasticity when broken down by group, not just product.

**Impact on Assignment:** Vital to Section 1 and Section 3. You can extend this example to argue that fast fashion demand may differ sharply by income group. Tariff effects may disproportionately reduce purchases among price-sensitive groups (e.g., low-income shoppers), complicating the article's claim that fast fashion demand “will fall” in general.

---

### **Example 6: Critique of Historical Elasticity Tables**

**Quote/Location:** *Section “Misleading Historical Elasticities’ Tables”, pp. 6–7*

> “Houthakker and Taylor (1970)... these are not true price elasticities... more accurately a spending elasticity.”

**Point Supported:** Many widely cited elasticity values are outdated or misinterpreted, leading students to believe elasticity is fixed.

**Evidence Strength:** **Strong**
This is a sharp empirical critique. The authors show the methodological flaws (e.g., elasticities based on total expenditures) and misalignment with modern data. They also list specific textbooks still relying on this flawed data.

**Impact on Reliability:** Reinforces the article’s empirical and methodological credibility. It also explains why students (and possibly journalists) misunderstand elasticity — because even textbooks misrepresent it.

**Impact on Assignment:** Very useful for criticizing the *Guardian* article’s failure to recognize that demand elasticity is dynamic and context-dependent. You can cite this to argue that unless current data is used, conclusions about how much demand will fall are speculative and possibly misleading.

---

### **Overall Reliability of Source**

The article presents a cohesive, well-supported critique of how elasticity is taught and applied in economic education. It uses well-constructed examples, combines logical reasoning with empirical reference, and highlights both conceptual and pedagogical issues. Its central argument—that elasticity depends on *where* you are on the demand curve, not simply slope or good type—is consistently backed by examples.

**Strengths:**

* Clear logical structure.
* Real-world and classroom-based examples.
* Empirical critique of textbook data.
* Strong alignment with intermediate microeconomics curriculum.

**Limitations:**

* Some claims (e.g., on demand curve rotation) are more speculative.
* Lacks rigorous empirical testing/data for some examples.

---

**Summary of Use for Your Assignment:**

* **Supports your critique of the Guardian article’s elasticity oversimplifications.**
* **Extends your arguments about demand heterogeneity across consumers.**
* **Complicates assumptions about price shifts by introducing segment-level analysis and curve positioning.**
* **Strengthens your call for better data and nuanced interpretation of policy effects.**

# **SOURCE: “Does Competition Increase Pass-Through?” by Robert A. Ritz – *The RAND Journal of Economics*, Vol. 55, No. 1, Spring 2024, pp. 140–165**

---

### **Example 1: Figure 1 – Monopoly vs. Competition Under Convex Costs**

**Source location:** pp. 141–142, Section 1: *Introduction*

**Author's Argument:**
The standard intuition is that more competition leads to higher pass-through of costs to prices. Ritz uses a stylized example to show that this intuition *can reverse* under convex cost functions.

> “A monopoly optimally produces Qₘ < K units at marginal cost c, leading to the textbook result of a pass-through rate of ∂Pₘ/∂MC = 1/2… A competitive industry, by contrast, produces at capacity, Qc = K, so its market price does not change and so its rate of pass-through ∂Pc/∂MC = 0.” (*p. 142*)

**Point Supported:**
This supports Ritz’s central claim: **with even modest cost convexity, market power may *increase* pass-through**. The competitive firm, operating at capacity, cannot respond to a cost shock via output adjustment, so price stays fixed despite increased costs. The monopolist, with slack, adjusts price.

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Moderate.** The example is clear and intuitive, demonstrating a reversal of the standard result using textbook linear demand and piecewise-constant marginal cost. However:

* It’s a *stylized* (non-empirical) case.
* The convexity is extreme: capacity is binding for perfect competition but not for monopoly.
* No empirical data is offered—so the case functions as *illustrative*, not confirmatory.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
This is a theoretical construct, not an observed case, so it doesn’t directly prove the claim in the real world. But it logically **illustrates the mechanism** the author wants to highlight. The clarity of logic strengthens the **internal validity** of the argument.

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
This **complicates** the media article’s simple view that tariffs lead directly to price hikes. You can use this to argue that **whether prices rise depends on how close firms are to capacity**. For example, if Shein faces production constraints, its ability to pass on tariffs might be limited—even in a competitive setting. This sharpens your critique of the article's generalizations.

---

### **Example 2: Proposition 1 – Cross-Market Comparison of Pass-Through**

**Source location:** pp. 145–146, Section 4: *Pass-Through “Between Markets”*

**Author's Argument:**
Proposition 1 gives a condition under which the standard intuition reverses:

> “Equilibrium cost pass-through is lower in the more competitive market … if and only if demand and cost conditions satisfy: η\_S + ξ\_D ≥ 1.” (*p. 145*)

Ritz interprets this:

> “Cost convexity dampens pass-through and a more competitive market is more exposed to it.” (*p. 145*)

**Point Supported:**
The example supports the argument that **market structure alone doesn't determine pass-through**; it depends critically on **cost and demand curvature**. Hence, **empirical comparisons must control for those**.

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Strong theoretical reasoning.** While again not empirical, this is a formally derived condition. The logic is tight: given known elasticity and convexity metrics, the result holds *generally*. This is a substantial contribution and links to economic fundamentals.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
High. While not data-based, the theory is transparent and derived from first principles. Ritz clearly states assumptions and builds from well-known models (e.g., Cournot, Bulow-Pfleiderer).

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
You can **directly use the condition η\_S + ξ\_D ≥ 1** as a framework to evaluate whether Shein is likely to fully pass through tariffs. For example, if cost functions are convex due to production bottlenecks, and demand is not highly elastic, **pass-through may be muted**—contradicting the media article’s expectation.

---

### **Example 3: Empirical Case – Gasoline Markets in Greece**

**Source location:** pp. 155–156, Section 7: *Empirical Implications*

**Author's Argument:**
Ritz cites a study by Genakos and Pagliero (forthcoming) showing empirical support for the standard intuition—*but only under constant marginal cost*:

> “They argue that the firm-level marginal cost of gasoline stations is approximately constant… they find pass-through is just below 0.5 in monopoly markets and quickly rises toward 1 in markets with at least four firms.” (*p. 155*)

**Point Supported:**
This example supports Ritz’s claim that **constant marginal cost is a knife-edge assumption**. When it holds, the standard model fits. But once cost convexity enters, the relationship between competition and pass-through shifts.

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Strong.** This is real-world data. The author uses it to show that theory *with the right assumptions* matches observed outcomes. He does not overclaim; instead, he emphasizes the need to align assumptions with real conditions.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
Enhances it. Ritz shows that his model doesn't displace the standard view—it *extends it conditionally*. This makes the overall argument more nuanced and credible.

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
Use this to **validate your point**: if fast fashion has **constant marginal cost**, standard models may apply. But if costs are rising (e.g., from tariff compliance, shipping limits, logistics), then **pass-through may behave differently**. This helps you argue the article overlooks key firm-level constraints.

---

### **Example 4: Cobb-Douglas and Capacity Constraint Microfoundations**

**Source location:** p. 146, Paragraph 3 of Section 4

**Author's Argument:**
Ritz explains how **cost convexity arises** from basic production structures:

> “Let xᵢ = A kᵢ^α lᵢ^β… Cost is at least as convex as quadratic whenever β ≤ 1/2.”
> “A larger endowment of the fixed factor kᵢ reduces marginal cost but leaves η\_S unchanged.” (*p. 146*)

**Point Supported:**
This example grounds convex cost assumptions in **common production tech**. It helps justify why convex costs are not exotic but potentially *ubiquitous*—especially in short-run settings like fast fashion logistics or shipping.

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Moderate to strong.** This is theoretical but based on *standard* functional forms (Cobb-Douglas). The logic is clear: fixed factors → convex costs → higher η\_S. This supports the plausibility of the model.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
Improves it. Ritz is showing that his theoretical mechanism could plausibly occur in real firms—not just in stylized math.

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
You can use this to argue **why Shein and Temu may exhibit convex costs**, especially if they're scaling rapidly or facing short-run constraints (e.g., warehouse space, customs delays). This bolsters your Section 2 critique.

---

### **Example 5: Proposition 2 – Within-Market Change in Competition**

**Source location:** pp. 148–150, Section 5: *Pass-Through “Within Market”*

**Author's Argument:**
Ritz shows that **even within a single market**, increasing competition can lower pass-through if:

> “η\_S(φ\_S − 1) ≥ (1 + θ\_S)/(ε\_D − θ\_S)” (*p. 150*)

**Point Supported:**
This shows that **cost convexity (η\_S) and slope curvature (φ\_S)** together determine whether more competition leads to more or less pass-through—even holding demand constant.

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Strong but conditional.** The condition is derived from first principles. It’s not universal—it requires certain elasticities and convexities—but the logic is transparent and precise.

**Impact on Source Reliability:**
This makes the paper more *mechanically robust* and useful for applied settings. It reinforces that *context-specific factors* must be considered in real-world applications.

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
Use this in **Section 3** to argue that **if Shein’s cost structure is nonlinear and capacity-limited**, then even increased competition (from Temu or elsewhere) may not increase pass-through. This adds rigor to your policy critique.

---

### Overall Reliability Assessment:

The Ritz article is **highly reliable as a theoretical framework**. It does not present its conclusions as empirical facts but rather **as conditional statements** based on clear economic logic and models. It repeatedly distinguishes when the standard intuition holds (η\_S = 0, constant MC) versus when it doesn’t (η\_S > 0, convex costs), and it **explicitly derives the thresholds** where these differences matter. The use of both stylized examples and real-world references (like gasoline and cement) makes it highly applicable.

---

### Summary: Impact on Your Assignment

This source will help you:

* **Challenge the media article’s simple causal chain** (tariff → price ↑) by introducing cost structure and firm behavior.
* **Apply microeconomic rigor** (elasticity, convex cost, marginal decisions) to clarify when and how prices respond.
* **Support your use of diagrams and formulas** with published theory (e.g., Lemma 1).
* **Extend your argument** to include nuanced effects of firm constraints and market structure—often ignored in media discussions.

### **CASE STUDY 1: Supermarket Scanner Data – Empirical Test of Welfare Effects of 3DPD**

**Location:** Abstract, “Empirics” section, Section 4.4 “Results: Anticompetitive Potential of 3DPD”

**Point Supported:**
The author uses empirical supermarket pricing data to test whether third-degree price discrimination (3DPD) increases or decreases output and welfare. The central claim is that **“3DPD decreases output and welfare relative to uniform pricing in most cases”**, contradicting the long-held assumption that price discrimination is typically efficient (Abstract).

**Evidence:**
Miravete evaluates **over 160,000 store-product combinations across 10 product categories** using **nonparametric demand estimation**. He finds:

* “Output is predicted to increase only for 26% of product-chains… welfare only increases for 19%” (Section 4.4).
* “Welfare possibly being lower for 76% of product-chains (78% of sales)” (Section 4.4).
* These findings hold **across all 10 product categories** (Table 6).

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Strong.** The evidence rests on a **large-scale dataset (IRI 2008–2011)** and **nonparametric demand estimation**, which avoids the curvature constraints of parametric models. The use of multiple polynomial specifications (Stone-Weierstrass and Müntz-Szász) strengthens robustness. Results are consistent across methods and categories, supporting reliability.

**Reliability Assessment:**
High. The analysis is internally consistent, well-documented, and based on **observed firm behavior** in real markets. The author carefully accounts for cost assumptions and price endogeneity (Section 4.1). He also transparently states modeling limitations (e.g., no product substitution or consumer switching between stores).

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
This case study is highly relevant to your **critique of fast fashion tariffs**. It suggests that **price discrimination (or pricing flexibility)** can reduce welfare — challenging the idea that removing a subsidy (the de-minimis exemption) inherently improves efficiency. If Shein and Temu lose pricing flexibility due to tariffs, the result may not be increased competition or welfare, but rather **misallocation and loss of consumer surplus**, particularly for low-valuation consumers.

Use this to **extend your Section 3 on government intervention**: even policies aiming to equalize treatment (uniform pricing/tariff removal) can create distortions if **local demand curvature** isn’t considered.

### **CASE STUDY 2: Demand Manifold Theory – Theoretical Justification of Empirical Tests**

**Location:** “Theory” section, especially “3.1 Curvature Conditions and Demand Manifolds” and “3.2 Demand Curvature Heterogeneity”

**Point Supported:**
The author argues that unless **local demand curvature varies sharply**, 3DPD **reduces welfare and output**, especially when elasticity and curvature are negatively correlated. This justifies the empirical findings: observed pricing patterns cannot produce welfare gains unless these rare conditions hold.

**Evidence:**
Using Pollak demand systems and curvature-manifold diagrams (Figure 1), Miravete formalizes how different relationships between elasticity and curvature determine the **direction of welfare change** under 3DPD:

> “If demand manifolds are downward sloping... output and welfare decreases with 3DPD unless... demands have drastically different curvatures” (Section 3.2).

He also explains that **most real-world demand systems**, like linear, translog, or Stone-Geary, have **invariant or downward-sloping manifolds**, thus cannot support welfare gains under 3DPD unless flexibility is introduced (Table 1).

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Strong, with caveats.** The logic is rigorous and based on published theoretical work (e.g., Mrazová & Neary 2017). However, the conclusions depend heavily on assumptions about the **shape of demand** and do not incorporate supply-side dynamics like entry, strategic firm behavior, or product variety.

**Reliability Assessment:**
Moderate-to-high. The framework is theoretical but grounded in well-established industrial organization literature. The main limitation is that it excludes broader general equilibrium or competitive dynamics.

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
This theory helps **sharpen your Section 1 (Elasticity and Tariff Incidence)**: tariffs create uniform price floors, akin to removing 3DPD. If fast fashion goods are in highly elastic markets with negative curvature, **uniform tariffs may lower output and welfare**, even if superficially correcting “unfair pricing.” This **complicates** the simplistic efficiency claim in the article.

Use this theory to **model how firm constraints (via tariff) intersect with demand heterogeneity**, reinforcing your critique of the article’s shallow treatment of consumer behavior.

### **CASE STUDY 3: Logit Demand Bias in Applied Work**

**Location:** “3.3 Implications for Empirical Analysis,” last paragraph

**Point Supported:**
Miravete warns that widely used **logit demand models** always predict that 3DPD increases welfare and output due to their **built-in curvature assumptions** (positive ε-ρ correlation).

> “Any estimate of a multinomial logit model… predicts, by construction, that 3DPD leads to increases in output and welfare” (Section 3.3).

This implies that studies using logit models **may systematically overstate the benefits** of discriminatory pricing.

**Evidence:**
He compares curvature properties of common demand systems (Table 1) and shows that only logit has **upward-sloping demand manifolds**, artificially producing positive welfare effects.

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Strong.** The critique is technical but well-substantiated by manifold theory and supported by reference to Mrazová & Neary (2017). It highlights a **bias in empirical industrial organization**.

**Reliability Assessment:**
High. The conclusion is logically derived and directly challenges widespread modeling practices.

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
Use this to **critique how popular media may unknowingly rely on biased empirical interpretations**. For instance, if fast fashion firms defend their pricing with elasticity-based claims, Miravete’s work suggests that **these claims are likely model-dependent and potentially misleading**.

This supports your broader argument in Section 2: **firm behavior under cost shocks cannot be trusted without assessing the structure of underlying demand**.

### **CASE STUDY 4: Bork’s Welfare Proxy and Historical Misjudgment**

**Location:** Section 2 “Robert Bork: Output as Proxy for Welfare”

**Point Supported:**
Miravete critiques the **legal and economic orthodoxy** that output increases = welfare gains, tracing it back to Bork’s influential interpretation of Robinson’s theory.

> “Using output as a proxy for welfare… exaggerates the benefits and underestimates the welfare harm of 3DPD” (Section 2).

> “It is not data but Joan Robinson’s sole opinion… that informs Bork’s belief” (Section 2).

**Evidence:**
Miravete exposes that **Bork’s entire rationale** was based on **untested theory**, not data. He quotes Bork relying on **Robinson (1933)** rather than any empirical work.

> “Robinson… thought it more probable… that output would be greater under discrimination” (Bork 1978, quoted in Section 2).

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Strong.** The logical structure is clear: theoretical assumption → policy position → decades of legal impact → empirical disproof via Miravete’s findings.

**Reliability Assessment:**
Very high. The source shows how **empirical analysis can overturn entrenched but data-poor arguments**.

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
This strengthens your **Conclusion section**. Like Bork, the article you’re critiquing **assumes price increases (tariffs) will realign markets fairly**. But unless output and welfare are evaluated separately, **policy choices risk repeating the same logical error**.

Frame your critique as part of a broader pattern: **public discourse overrelies on theoretical proxies (like output)** instead of direct welfare measurement.

### **CASE STUDY 5: Chain Size and Welfare Effects**

**Location:** Table 5 and Section 4.4

**Point Supported:**
Miravete examines whether 3DPD effects differ by firm size (measured as number of stores per chain). He finds that **larger chains more frequently violate regularity conditions like IRC**, and that **welfare decreases more often in larger chains**.

> “Demands estimated for products sold by larger chains are inconclusive in nearly all cases” (Table 5 summary, Section 4.4).

**Evidence:**
Quantitative breakdown shows that for chains with 11+ stores:

* Output increases in only 6.26% of cases.
* Welfare increases in only 1.34% of chain-products.
* Welfare decreases in 94.75% (output not increasing enough).

**Strength of Evidence:**
**Strong within its scope.** The cross-tabulation is clear and interpretable, though it does not model the *cause* of these differences.

**Reliability Assessment:**
Moderate-to-high. Results are transparent, and implications are important for understanding market structure effects.

**Impact on Your Assignment:**
This case can **extend your Section 2 on firm response**. Large fast fashion firms like Shein operate with **high scale and centralized pricing**, much like large retail chains. The data suggest that **scale does not protect against welfare-reducing effects** of discriminatory pricing restrictions. This complicates the article’s assumption that “brands won’t be surprised”—scale doesn’t guarantee adaptive efficiency.

Use this to challenge the article’s confidence in firm adaptability and underline the **importance of structural analysis**.

### **Example/Case Study 1: Zara – Vertically Integrated Fast Fashion Model**

**Section:** “Zara” (pp. 255–257)

**Claim Supported:**
That speed-to-market and integration of supply, production, and demand responsiveness are core to fast fashion success, and create a durable competitive advantage in an uncertain fashion market.

**Evidence Used:**
Taplin details Zara’s approach, including:

* Retaining “higher value-added stages of production in-house” (p. 255).
* Geographic proximity of production (Spain, Portugal, Morocco) to reduce turnaround times to “2–5 weeks to meet demand for what is actually selling” (p. 255).
* Use of sales data from store managers to “instantly adapt to customer demands” (p. 256).
* Very low product failure rate of “approximately 1 per cent… much lower than the industry norm of 10 per cent” (p. 257).
* Very low advertising spend: “0.3 per cent of its revenue on advertising whilst its competitors average 3–4 per cent” (p. 257).

**Assessment of Evidence Strength:** **Strong**

* The case is detailed, uses quantitative data (failure rate, time-to-market, advertising ratios), and shows causality between operational structure and observed outcomes.
* It connects firm strategy (vertically integrated supply chain) to market behavior (quick demand feedback) to firm performance (higher profits, fewer markdowns).
* The logic is tight and the evidence is both descriptive and outcome-based.

**Impact on Assignment:**

* **Extends** your Section 2 (“Firm Behavior: Cost Shock and Strategic Response”) by offering a contrast to Shein or Temu’s outsourced model. You can argue that **Zara’s integration makes it less exposed** to tariffs like those discussed in the Trump article.
* Shows how **different cost structures (labor vs. speed trade-off)** influence firm responses—Zara may absorb or avoid cost shocks via agility, while others cannot.
* Supports use of micro tools (MC shifts, strategic response under imperfect competition) by offering a firm-level example with clear marginal cost implications.

### **Example/Case Study 2: H\&M – Cost-Based Outsourcing Model**

**Section:** “H\&M” (pp. 257–258)

**Claim Supported:**
That fast fashion can also be pursued through cost-minimizing outsourcing rather than speed or trend leadership.

**Evidence Used:**

* H\&M “does not own any factories… buys products from independent suppliers, 75 per cent… in Asia” (p. 257).
* Long supply chains result in “products retail on average about 60 per cent cheaper than Zara’s” (p. 257).
* Yet the firm “finds it difficult to react quickly to changing trends” (p. 258).
* 2011 sales decline of “3 per cent” is used to indicate the weakness of its model relative to Zara (p. 258).
* H\&M “cannot charge more” because it lacks cutting-edge design or speed.

**Assessment of Evidence Strength:** **Moderate**

* The causal connection between supply chain design and sales performance is **plausible but only weakly supported by evidence**.
* One data point (3% decline in 2011 sales) is not sufficient to generalize about business model failure.
* Still, the contrast with Zara is logical and framed well with structural differences in sourcing and product design.

**Impact on Assignment:**

* Supports your **Section 2** by offering a **comparative case** to analyze **differential firm response** to cost increases. Tariffs will **hit H\&M’s outsourced, Asia-heavy model harder**, just like Shein.
* You can use this to suggest that **not all fast fashion firms are equally equipped** to handle tariff shocks.
* Highlights how **market structure (differentiation, pricing power)** interacts with cost-side shocks—a central point in your firm's elasticity and pricing strategy discussion.

### **Example/Case Study 3: Benetton – Early Flexible Specialization Model**

**Section:** “Marketing fashion; fashioning markets” (pp. 254–255)

**Claim Supported:**
That early innovators like Benetton used flexibility and localization to meet diverse global demands, but were ultimately outpaced by newer fast fashion models.

**Evidence Used:**

* Benetton “produced fashion-forward goods in neutral shades that could be dyed… based on local demand” (p. 254).
* Utilized “point of entry sales data… shifting production within a network of contractors” (p. 254).
* Declined due to being “unable to accurately monitor consumer trends… significantly over-expanded” (p. 255).
* “Lost market share to… Zara, H\&M, Top Shop, and Forever 21” (p. 255).

**Assessment of Evidence Strength:** **Moderate to Strong**

* Historically rich example, clearly tied to key themes: innovation, flexibility, and market responsiveness.
* The decline is explained by over-expansion and loss of trend accuracy, suggesting **lack of ongoing demand-side monitoring** is a key failure mode.
* The logical progression from early strength to later decline is plausible, though more performance data would improve it.

**Impact on Assignment:**

* Complicates your **Section 2 & 3**: even firms that emphasize **flexibility and innovation** may falter if **demand-side information is weak**.
* You can use this to discuss the **limits of supply chain innovation without consumer feedback loops**—relevant to evaluating if tariff-induced shifts will help or hurt firms.
* Also supports the idea that **tariff policy may not help domestic firms** unless they also understand and serve consumer demand better.

### **Example/Case Study 4: Li & Fung – Trading Intermediary Supporting Flexibility**

**Section:** “Outsourcing and export-led growth” (p. 252)

**Claim Supported:**
That intermediaries like Li & Fung help Western retailers manage complex global supply chains by bundling small orders, finding suppliers, and ensuring quality and speed.

**Evidence Used:**

* “Li & Fung… takes orders from small firms, combine\[s] them and realize\[s] production and distribution scale economies” (p. 252).
* “Able to reconfigure supply chains to emphasize flexibility, innovation and speed” (p. 252).
* “Acts as intermediary to help clients… with design, outsourcing, and timing” (p. 252).

**Assessment of Evidence Strength:** **Moderate**

* Good example of logistical innovation and intermediation; descriptive but not supported with quantitative outcomes.
* Useful in explaining **how firms without integration (like Shein)** can still compete via networked flexibility, but lacks direct outcome evidence.

**Impact on Assignment:**

* Offers nuance to **Section 2**: even without vertical integration, some firms may mitigate cost shocks through **intermediary support**.
* Could be used to question whether **tariff policy hurts all importers equally**—some may already have logistical agility built in via intermediaries.
* Allows critique of the article’s implicit binary between domestic and imported production—real-world complexity is greater.

### **Example/Case Study 5: MFA Phase-Out and China/Bangladesh Rise**

**Section:** “Outsourcing and export-led growth” (p. 251)

**Claim Supported:**
That liberalized trade regimes, especially the removal of MFA quotas, allowed countries like China and Bangladesh to dominate global apparel exports.

**Evidence Used:**

* “China went from 4 per cent of world clothing exports in 1980 to 25 per cent today” (p. 251).
* Bangladesh: “\$20 billion garment industry… 4 million workers… second only to China” (p. 251).

**Assessment of Evidence Strength:** **Strong**

* Concrete trade data and clear before/after contrast linked to policy change.
* Supports argument that **rules-based trade policy shapes industry geography**.

**Impact on Assignment:**

* Directly supports your **Section 3** on government policy: policy shifts like the de-minimis removal could reverse the liberalization trend that enabled fast fashion growth.
* Shows how **institutional changes enable cost advantages**, which the Trump tariffs are trying to roll back—raising the question of **efficiency vs. fairness**.

---

### **Overall Reliability of Source**

**Strengths:**

* Evidence-based and well-documented.
* Uses multiple firm-level case studies.
* Strong alignment between theory and example.
* Clearly distinguishes between different fast fashion strategies.

**Limitations:**

* Some arguments would benefit from more rigorous empirical data (especially H\&M, Benetton).
* Focuses on firm logistics more than on formal modeling of microeconomic trade-offs (e.g., diagrams, elasticity measures).

**Conclusion on Usefulness for Assignment:**

* **Highly complementary and extending.**
* Taplin’s work allows you to embed the Trump tariff story within a broader **economic logic of firm behavior**, **consumer preference**, and **market adjustment mechanisms**.
* Strengthens your ability to apply **Modules 5–7 (consumer), 12–13 (firms), and 15 (policy)** by giving vivid illustrations of theory in action.
