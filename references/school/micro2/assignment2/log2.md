Still researching and reading and synthesizing.


# Goal
    - summarise what the article says.
    - Apply economic theory to analyze it critically.
    - Challenge or extend the arguments.
    - Use course concepts and diagrams to support your points.



# STRUCTURE
## Executive Summary (150‚Äì200 words)

Summarize:
	‚Ä¢	The article‚Äôs main claim: Tariffs will increase prices for fast fashion imports (Shein, Temu), possibly changing consumer behavior and firm strategies.
	‚Ä¢	Your thesis: While the article acknowledges surface-level effects, it lacks economic depth on consumer price sensitivity, firm cost-pass-through, and the true distributional and efficiency consequences.
	‚Ä¢	Main tools: elasticity, tax incidence, firm behavior under cost shocks, market failure policy justification.

‚∏ª

## Introduction (150‚Äì200 words)

Set the stage:
	‚Ä¢	Briefly describe the de-minimis rule and the recent tariff change.
	‚Ä¢	State why this is an important topic in microeconomics: consumer decision-making, firm pricing, welfare effects, market intervention.
	‚Ä¢	Preview the structure of your critique: you‚Äôll focus on consumer demand response, firm adaptation, and the efficiency justification of the policy.

üîç ANALYSIS SECTION (MAIN BODY, ~1000 words)

Here are the 3 most relevant sections, grounded in critique:

‚∏ª

## **1. Tariff Incidence, Elasticity, and Consumer Behavior**

Elasticity of demand.

Core Modules: 6 (Price changes), 7 (Elasticity), 5 (Consumer optimization)

Critique:
	‚Ä¢	The article claims prices will rise and demand may fall ‚Äî but doesn‚Äôt examine how responsive consumers actually are.
	‚Ä¢	Use price elasticity of demand: if Shein‚Äôs goods are extremely elastic (substitutable, not essential), small price increases could cause large drops in quantity demanded.
	‚Ä¢	Analyze who bears the burden of the tariff (supplier vs consumer), based on elasticity.
	‚Ä¢	Use a tax diagram to show price wedge and consumer surplus loss.
	‚Ä¢	Apply income and substitution effects ‚Äî are these goods normal, inferior, or even Giffen (unlikely)? The article assumes price increases shift demand but doesn‚Äôt analyze underlying preferences.

Criticism: The article glosses over the distributional impact ‚Äî who exactly gets priced out? What about low-income consumers for whom these goods are substitutes for more expensive clothing?

‚∏ª

## **2. Firm Behavior: Cost Shock and Strategic Response**

Elasticity of supply.

Core Modules: 12 (Cost and profit), 13 (Market structure), possibly Game Theory (11)

Critique:
	‚Ä¢	The article notes that firms like Shein and Temu are adapting by relocating production ‚Äî but doesn‚Äôt evaluate how cost shocks affect firm pricing and output.
	‚Ä¢	Use profit-maximization condition (MR = MC) to explain how tariff-driven cost increases might lead to reduced output or price hikes, depending on market power.
	‚Ä¢	Frame fast fashion as an imperfect competition market ‚Äî maybe Bertrand competition with differentiation.
	‚Ä¢	Analyze how resale platforms (ThredUp, etc.) might benefit if they operate under lower marginal costs or don‚Äôt face the same cost pressures.
	‚Ä¢	Use diagrams: MC shifts, pricing decisions under different structures.

Criticism: The article treats supply chain changes as operational, but they‚Äôre deeply economic ‚Äî Shein isn‚Äôt just moving production, it‚Äôs changing marginal cost curves and market strategy. This has long-run implications for pricing and competition.

## **3. Government Intervention: Efficiency, Distortion, or Correction?**

Core Modules: 15 (Market failure), 14 (Efficiency), 7 (Welfare)

Critique:
	‚Ä¢	The article hints that the de-minimis rule gave Shein/Temu an unfair edge ‚Äî but doesn‚Äôt deeply assess whether the rule distorted competition.
	‚Ä¢	Consider whether the tariff corrects a market failure or simply introduces inefficiency.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate deadweight loss (DWL) from taxing cheap goods ‚Äî efficiency cost vs. equity gain?
	‚Ä¢	Analyze if promoting secondhand markets like ThredUp generates positive externalities (e.g., environmental benefits) that justify intervention.
	‚Ä¢	Discuss allocative efficiency: are we moving closer to or further from a Pareto efficient outcome?

Criticism: The article assumes supporting resale is inherently good ‚Äî but is the policy tool (tariff) efficient for achieving that goal? Does it distort incentives elsewhere?

**Conclusion (150‚Äì200 words)**
	‚Ä¢	Reiterate your key critiques: the article fails to engage with core microeconomic concepts like elasticity, tax incidence, marginal cost behavior, and efficiency.
	‚Ä¢	Emphasize that economic theory clarifies who bears the cost, how firms respond, and whether the policy is economically justified.
	‚Ä¢	Close with a reflection: if public discourse used these micro tools, we‚Äôd see more informed policy and journalism.
