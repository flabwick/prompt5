**A. Consumer Preferences and Utility Models**


The biggest assumption that Adams makes about fast fashion is that consumers of fast fashion are primarily price-driven. They use this to claim that if prices of fast fashion increase, demand will decrease as consumers buy fashion items elsewhere.


This oversimplifies consumer behaviour. Consumer preferences are often complex and are relative to the price category of the product, and involve other psychological factors.


The article also does not consider diminishing marginal utility of income. If a good already costs very little, increases in price lead to a small loss in utility per dollar. Because the baseline is so low consumers were not gaining much utility to begin with and will be less influenced by price incareases. Even though the price change might be large in magnitude, the quantity demanded may not increase that much. This is especially true for fast fashion because it relies heavily on non-price attributes like process utility and perceived novelty.

Consumers derive satisfaction from the act of browsing and discovering. Shein and Temu are particularly successful at this, they have huge engagement on their apps and they include interactive games and rewards which draws customers in to buy. The utility gained from fast fashion is not isolated to the product, but is tied to the platform they are sold on.

Further, consumers of fast fashion tend to show strongly convex preferences. The psychological cost of experimentation is reduced by the low price and disposability of products, so consumers show diviersity-seeking behaviour; A second identical piece of cheap clothing tends to give far less utility than the first.

To cater to the diversity-seeking demands of consumers, fast fashion plaforms flood their sites with seemingly endless variety. Over 6,000 new products are uploaded by Shein every day. Variety itself is a fundamental source of utiltiy; fast fashion consumers don't just want something cheap, they want something new. 


**B. Budget Constraints and Algorithmic Mediation**

The logic that consumer behaviour is a direct response to price changes rests on the assumption that consumers can see all goods, compare them and substitute freely based on price. The assumption of an exogenous budget set ignores search frictions, algorithm feeds or platform design.

But budget sets on platforms like Shein and Temu are endogenous, because what users see is curated by algorithmic feeds. Consumers choose from a filtered subset that aligns with engagement, promotions and the goals of the platform, not just what gives the highest utility.

This means that traditional assumptions like the standard tangency condition (MRS = price ratio) may not hold. As a result, price increases may not lead to clean substituted effects.

If the alternative options or platforms aren't visible, consumers may continue to buy the same goods despite the higher prices.
