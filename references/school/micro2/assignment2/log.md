How much of a problems are these working conditions? These people work these jobs, if they are so terrible why not work somewhere else?

Talk about the reasons why people by temu and shein. The buy now impulse of fast fashion is likely just as big a factor as the price itself of the goods.

**Price isn't the only reason Shein and Temu are successful**. Prices aren't the only reason we receive a dopamine hit for purchasing something cheap. It's a loop driven by the immediacy, novelty and low psychological cost of the goods. They are necessary to make fast fashion work, but thy are not sufficient alone to making a fast fashion retailer successful.
- **Elasticity of demand** falls steeply as price nears zero, as does the extra marginal utility of the price reduction. Below a certain point, say $10, additional drops in prices. Price is necessary, but sees diminishing returns as a utility driver past a certain point.
- **Novelty**. Shein uploads 6,000+ new styles a day—no one is "searching" for this many jeans. The environment here lends itself to variety-seeking preferences and behaviour. Consumers want something different, not necessarily something better. Once a consumer buys something, its utility is instantly reduced from future purchase not because it was bad, but because it has already been chosen. In these environments, more of the same good yields a lot less satisfaction. Novelty itself is the good here, and consumers get zero utility from repetition. If you were to model this, the indifference curve shows greater utility when x is approximately equal to y.
- **Process Utility.** Standard utility functions focus on the outcomes (getting the product) and not the process (browsing, discovering, paying). With Shein and Temu a large part of the utility is the entertainment of scrolling through, like eye shopping in a clothing store. Graphing this requires adding a third dimension to a utility calculation, capturing the "process utility" of scrolling and discovery.
- In algorithmically mediated platforms like shein and temu, the set of visible choices is curated and therefore makes the budget set endogenous. Traditional theory for monopolistic competition states that the available set of goods is fully visible and accessible, so therefore the budget set is treated as externally given or exogenous. The consumer does not optimise over the full budget set but over a **visible subset** (marked by X's). This may be **smaller** or **biased** toward certain types of goods (e.g., higher-margin items, promoted products). Because options may appear as non-convex regions or isolated points, the convexirty assumption and therefore the tangency condition becomes redundant. It also becomes non-monotonic, because the "more is better" assumption breaks down when additional income doesn't lead to more visible or valuable options.

**Graph of Endogenous and Exogenous preferences**: Caused by the curated feed that consumers get.

**Digital monopolistic competition > traditional monopolistic competition.**
The article treats firms like Shein and Temu as passive agents in a perfectly competitive market: cost increases → price increases → demand falls or shifts. They are more likely to be:
- Digital monopolistic competition. In perfect competition, firms all sell identical products and can't raise prices (if they do, buyers go elsewhere immediately). Temu and Shein sell products that seem trendy and unique, even if they are all made in the same factory. This gives them a perceived uniqueness, and therefore some pricing power to raise their prices a little.
	- **The digital aspect** - Scale of their customer base is huge from apps. They can also use data to identify micro-trends and roll out products almost instantly.
		- Could result in a misreading of Elasticity of Demand. In digital monopolistic competition, brand and platform loyalty is algorithmically engineered. Temu uses very intentional habit loops, app design and influencer content. Demand can therefore be considered less elastic than the theory might suggest because switching costs like time, familiarity and trust associated with apps and the site. Especially with the chokehold they have on fast fashion. When you download an app, you generally tend to download the app with the most downloads. 
		- Oversimplifies entry and exit. In monopolistic competition, easy entry ensures long-run zero profits. But the algorithmic ecosystem makes it hard for new competitors to break in, or alternatively for existing power to be undone. More users means more data, better recommendations, better algorithms. Even if tariffs increase, Shein and Temu could maintain market share by sacrificing maragins.
		- Product differentiation: Shein and Temu are not just selling cheap goods. They are data-driven differentiation machines. It's not just the prices that make these goods attractive, but also the massive scale and fine-tune.
		- Increasing returns and market power. In a traditional lens, firms face diminishing returns, as they increase output their marginal costs also increase. Using this lens underplays how robust firms like Shein and Temu are to shocks like tariffs. Digital monopolies enjoy increasing returns to scale, because more users better data → better recommendations → more sales → more data. Shein and Temu benefit more than the average monopolistic firm with Market power, so they would be likely to use scale and AI to route around the cost spikes with strategic dominance, where a traditional firm with thin margins might simply exit.
		- Consumer choice. Regular lens assumes consumers are rational agents and freely compare prices across shops. In the digital context, consumer attention is controlled by platforms: search results, ads, influencer content. Any noticable differences in prices online are not based on the actual cheapest goods, but the goods that show on user interfaces. Price salience is managed by user interface. Consumer choice online is designed, and reactions to it might be muted or uneven relative to the textbook models.

Shein's top-selling products, (basic crop tops, phone cases, makeup tools) function not as profit centers but as acquisition devices. Their prices are often set _below marginal cost_ and are subsidized by other items that have higher margins or are impulse purchases.

In a tariff environment, what matters is not the _average cost increase_ but _how the firm chooses to distribute that cost_. Shein, with deep analytics and A/B testing infrastructure, can absorb tariffs on high-traffic SKUs and raise prices on lower-volume, lower-elasticity items like niche fashion accessories or plus-size categories, where consumer choice is narrower and alternatives are limited.

This is a textbook example of **third-degree price discrimination**—charging different effective prices to different consumer segments based on willingness to pay, now extended across SKUs instead of individuals.

The Guardian article, by ignoring this mechanism, treats the firm as if it operates under **perfect competition**, where marginal cost = price and all cost shocks must be passed on uniformly. But Shein behaves more like a vertically integrated platform-monopolist in certain product verticals. Its pricing strategy is a form of intertemporal cross-subsidization, not flat markup.
