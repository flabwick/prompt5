This project provides an opportunity for you to analyse some economic work as it
appears in popular media. You may choose to analyse work presented in newspapers,
extended-form videos, extended-form podcasts, or other similar media (other requires
written permission). Your task is to take one of these pieces of popular media, and
create a response piece critiquing the original work from an Intermediate Microeconomics
perspective. You may comment positively and/or negatively on the work, extend the
work, evaluate the contribution of the work, or similar. Your work could take the form of
either a report, video, or podcast.


Report: If you choose to write a report, you should produce a standard economics
report on the original media. I would expect to see a description of what the original
media claims, and then an extended critique of that work. The word limit is 1500 words
(±10%). Your report must include an appendix containing (i) your bibliography, and (ii)
your peer review comments, and (iii) how you incorporated your peer reviewers comments
into your report (or why you chose not to).





Marking Guide
You will be graded based on a combination of the following factors:
• Quality of Analysis: How well your review captures the context, methods, results,
and impact of your chosen article; and how well your report utilises the skills from
ECON2101 to evaluate/extend the ideas in the original media. Can be judged on
Accuracy, Precision, Logical Soundness, Lack of Bias, and Breadth and Depth of
Analysis.
• Quality of Expression: How well the report is written and expressed. This is
primarily concerned with the flow of argument.
• Use of Appropriate References: The quality and relevance of references used.
• Length Limit: The assignment must fall into the length limits described above.
• Referencing: References must be provided, the referencing system used must be
consistent, and of sufficient detail to be able to find the references. We do not
specify which specific referencing system must be used.
• Proper Academic Conduct: As always, submitted assignments must be your
own original material. Penalties for improper academic conduct range from a 10%
penalty on this assessment to suspension from the university. If you are not sure
whether a piece of conduct is acceptable, please ask (though if you’re not sure, it
probably isn’t).
