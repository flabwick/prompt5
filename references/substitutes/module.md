**VIII. Long-Term Legacy: Gold’s Imprint on Australia’s Economic Identity**  (300 words)
- **Gold’s role:** Permanently reshaped Australia's demographic, industrial, and fiscal structures.  
- **Subpoints:**  
  - Melbourne’s emergence as commercial hub.  
  - Rise of export dependency; slow diversification toward manufacturing.  
  - Institutional patterns of resource reliance continue to modern times.
- **Critical Point:** Gold **forged** the foundational economic path — both its early success and its later vulnerabilities.


Focus:

Enduring structures and patterns that gold locked into Australia’s economy beyond the nineteenth century.

Shaping of demographic concentration (Melbourne), export-dependency, and resource-driven economic cycles.

Argument:

Gold embedded a permanent economic model: external market reliance, commodity exposure, urban primacy, slow diversification.

These patterns shaped Australia’s 20th-century and even 21st-century trajectory.
