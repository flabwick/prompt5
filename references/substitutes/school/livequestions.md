Tutorial quiz 6 this week. 
1. Consider an economy that only produces two goods - Bacon (B) and Apple Sauce (A). The Production Possibilities Frontier is described by B2 + A2 = 400. 
a) Draw the PPF for this economy, labelling points as relevant. 
b) If the price ratio of bacon to apple sauce is PB/PA = 2/1 how much of each good is produced? Explain. [You may use the fact that the slope of the PPF at a given point (A, B) is −A/B without showing why. Challenge - can you show why?] 
c) Suppose consumers have utility given by u(A, B) = A + 3B. Is the price ratio and quantities of both goods found in part (b) a Walrasian Equilibrium? 
d) What price ratio would lead to a Walrasian Equilibrium in this case? 
2. Consider a 2-good (rice and noodles), 2-consumer allocation problem (between Amalia and Belle). Amalia’s utility is uA(r, n) = r0.5n0.5 while Belle’s is uB(r, n) = r1/3n2/3. Suppose they have an initial allocation where Amalia has 12 units of rice and 6 units of noodles, while Belle has 8 units of rice and 16 units of noodles. 
a) What are Amalia’s and Belle’s Marginal Rates of Substitution at their initial allocation? 
b) Draw the appropriate Edgeworth box showing the above information. 
c) On the Edgeworth box diagram, show all Pareto improvements from the initial allocation. Additionally, show which Pareto improvements are Pareto Efficient. 
d) Argue why prices which are ‘too extreme’ would result in no trade. What (specifically) are the prices which are ‘too extreme’ in this case. That is, what are the values. 
3. a) Discuss some examples of an industry/product where you think there is good reason to have a legal barrier to entry, creating a non-natural monopoly. 
b) Discuss some examples of an industry/product which currently has barriers to entry which you think are unreasonable. 
c) For those industries/products discussed in part (a), what are some of the downsides of implementing the barriers to entry, and what kind of regulation might be useful to limit these downsides.
