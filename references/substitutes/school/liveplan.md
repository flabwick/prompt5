Session Scope and Approach

Units Selected
Start with foundational consumer theory. Cover the following:
	•	Preferences and Indifference Curves (Unit 1)
	•	Utility Functions and Ordinal Utility (Unit 2)
	•	Marginal Utility and MRS (Unit 3)
	•	Budget Constraints (Unit 4)

These four units form the conceptual and graphical basis for the remainder of consumer theory and most of microeconomics. They must be established clearly before introducing constrained optimisation or comparative statics.

Method
Use active graph-based learning: students will draw indifference curves, sketch utility functions, and map budget constraints. Integrate verbal statements with diagram construction.

Avoid algebraic utility optimisation—this is explicitly not required at this stage.

Structure
	1.	Preferences and Indifference Curves
	•	Define complete, transitive preferences.
	•	Draw typical convex indifference curves; label bundles.
	•	Identify types of preferences: perfect substitutes, complements, bads, and useless goods using curve shape.
	•	Use arrows to show direction of increasing utility.
	2.	Utility Functions (Ordinal Only)
	•	Introduce the idea that utility numbers have no meaning beyond ranking.
	•	Compare U = A + B and U = min(A, B) to clarify substitutes vs. complements.
	•	Stress monotonic transformations: e.g., U = AB vs. ln(AB).
	3.	Marginal Utility and MRS
	•	Define MU as partial derivatives, using only simple Cobb-Douglas or linear examples.
	•	Use MU_A / MU_B to compute MRS.
	•	Explain how MRS = slope of indifference curve.
	4.	Budget Constraints
	•	Graph: intercepts at I/PA and I/PB.
	•	Show effects of price and income changes.
	•	Emphasise slope = –PA/PB, and its comparison to MRS later on.

Distinctive Course Elements
	•	No cardinal utility or welfare interpretation.
	•	Emphasis on qualitative interpretation of verbal statements.
	•	Budget constraints are handled graphically, not algebraically.
	•	No Lagrangians or constrained optimisation introduced yet.
	•	Key focus: graphical intuition and classification of preference types.

Use only 2-good models throughout. Include drawing exercises, quick classification drills, and basic interpretation questions.
