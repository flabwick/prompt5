General Approach

Since the student is at 0 XP in all areas, the session will focus on Stage 1 (Exposure). We'll build foundational understanding of key concepts across diverse areas using visual models, analogies, and verbal explanation, ensuring concepts are linked to their roles in broader economic reasoning. We'll prioritize clarity over precision at this stage and avoid formal mathematical derivation.

The session includes:

3 primary units for foundational development

2 spontaneous knowledge refreshers for passive memory priming

Primary Learning Scope

1. Unit: Preferences and Indifference Curves
Goal: Build intuitive understanding of consumer preferences and graphical representation.

Methods:

Use diagrams to explain indifference curves (shape, direction, meaning)

Compare perfect substitutes, complements, bads, and useless goods visually

Discuss verbal-to-graph translation (e.g., interpreting “prefers variety”)

Distinctive Course Emphasis:

No cardinal utility or numerical utility interpretation

Focus on drawing and qualitative judgment of curve types

Stage 1 → 2 Criteria (XP Rubric):

Can match verbal preference description to correct curve shape

Can distinguish direction of increasing utility

Recognizes perfect substitutes/complements and useless goods

2. Unit: Budget Constraints and Optimal Choice
Goal: Introduce feasible choice sets and how budget lines interact with preferences.

Methods:

Sketch budget lines, label intercepts

Show tangency with indifference curves

Emphasize direction of shifts under income/price changes

Distinctive Course Emphasis:

No algebraic solution or Engel curves

Visual/qualitative analysis of dominated, feasible, and unaffordable bundles

Stage 1 → 2 Criteria:

Can graph a basic budget line

Identifies optimal bundle as point of tangency

Understands income vs. price change effects visually

3. Unit: Expected Utility under Uncertainty
Goal: Lay foundation for decision-making with risk via gambles and lotteries.

Methods:

Use 2-outcome gamble tables

Calculate EV and EU given probabilities and utilities

Graph utility curves (concave, linear, convex)

Distinctive Course Emphasis:

Clear separation between EV and EU logic

Visual intuition about CE and risk attitudes

Avoid continuous distributions or ambiguity models

Stage 1 → 2 Criteria:

Can define EV and EU in words

Understands graphical meaning of CE and risk premium

Matches utility shapes to risk attitudes (concave = risk-averse)

Spontaneous Knowledge Refreshers

A. Subunit: Marginal Cost (Producer Theory)
Quick Check-In:

What does marginal cost represent?

Sketch basic TC and MC curves

Point out where MC = AC and why it matters

XP Target: Prevent forgetting basic cost logic before it’s formally learned later.

B. Subunit: Monopoly Pricing Logic
Quick Check-In:

Why does a monopolist not set price where demand = cost?

Show MR < D due to slope and price effects

Preview deadweight loss visually

XP Target: Passive priming of later welfare analysis without formal derivation.
