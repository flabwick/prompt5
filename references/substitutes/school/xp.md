Structure

* Subunit â†’ Smallest learning topic (e.g., Limits)
* Unit â†’ Group of subunits (e.g., Calculus)
* Master Unit â†’ All units combined (entire subject)

XP Flow

* XP is earned/lost only in subunits** based on performance.
* Unit XP** = average of its subunits' XP.
* Master Unit XP** = average of all unit XP.

XP Per Answer

| Performance vs Current Stage | XP Change |
| ---------------------------- | --------- |
| Performs 2+ stages above     | +120 XP   |
| Performs 1 stage above       | +60 XP    |
| Strong at current stage      | +30 XP    |
| Weak/inconsistent at stage   | +0 XP     |
| Performs 1 stage below       | â€“30 XP    |
| Performs 2+ stages below     | â€“60 XP    |

* Regression only occurs if XP falls **â‰¥100 XP below** a stage threshold.
* XP floor is 0.

Stage Thresholds (All Levels)

| Stage                               | XP Range    | Icon                                                       | Description |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ðŸ”´ Stage 1 â€“ Exposure               | 0â€“119 XP    | Has seen content but no functional understanding.          |             |
| ðŸŸ  Stage 2 â€“ Structural Mapping     | 120â€“299 XP  | Basic connections formed; partial logic.                   |             |
| ðŸŸ¡ Stage 3 â€“ Applied Integration    | 300â€“599 XP  | Accurate application across varied problems.               |             |
| ðŸŸ¢ Stage 4 â€“ Conceptual Flexibility | 600â€“899 XP  | Deep adaptability, flexible reasoning, abstraction.        |             |
| ðŸ”µ Stage 5 â€“ Operational Mastery    | 900â€“1199 XP | Fluent, efficient, precise performance with insight.       |             |
| ðŸ’Ž Stage 6 â€“ Diamond Mastery        | 1200+ XP    | Flawless generalization, creative application, full depth. |             |


Stage Guidelines (Based on Learning Science)

* Stage 1 (Exposure): Learner has surface familiarity only; no mental model.
* Stage 2 (Structural Mapping): Begins organizing knowledge; can follow logic but not yet apply it.
* Stage 3 (Applied Integration): Uses concepts in varied contexts; early transfer skills develop.
* Stage 4 (Flexibility): Adapts and reconfigures knowledge; begins abstracting patterns.
* Stage 5 (Mastery): High fluency, conceptual depth, consistent internal checking.
* Stage 6 (Diamond): Synthesizes, extends, and explains knowledge elegantly; peak expert-like behavior.

Adding Units/Subunits

* New units/subunits start at 0 XP.
* XP begins contributing to parent structures immediately.
* No unit can progress without all subunits growing.

Summary

* XP drives all progression.
* Stages reflect depth of understanding, not performance averages.
* Only growth earns XP. Stagnation or regression loses it.
* Nested structure ensures local mastery feeds global mastery.


Decay Rules:

* Decay starts 24h after last activity in a subunit.
* Applies only to subunits below Stage 6 (ðŸ’Ž is immune).
* XP decays every 12h of inactivity:

| Current Stage | XP Loss per 12h |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Stage 1â€“2     | â€“10 XP          |
| Stage 3       | â€“20 XP          |
| Stage 4       | â€“30 XP          |
| Stage 5       | â€“40 XP          |

* No decay below 0 XP.

RULE: YOU CANNOT BE NEGATIVE XP! DO NOT REDUCE XP TO BELOW 0.
