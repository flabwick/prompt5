Make me a UI that works entirely online through a github codespace.


Tab-based interface. There is a main panel with a sidebar and a horizontal bar at the top that displays the tabs for selection.
Tab bar - You can select, reorder, x to remove it. When you click any of the files it appears in the main panel and appears as a new item on the tab bar.
Sidebar - File tree with folder support. Each folder has a dropdown arrow you can expand or collapse. No limits to nesting. Files can be the following types: txt, md, pdf, epub, csv. In this menu you can
- Create new folder
- Create new markdown file
- Drag and drop to move files or folders.
- Rename files and folders.
- When you click a file or folder it highlights.

When you click a file it shows in the main panel. It should have a separate viewer for each of the files types. Markdown and txt form renders as an inline editor. You can make edits and save them, then the files in the system update. 

The files are going to be quite long and there's going to be a lot of them.
