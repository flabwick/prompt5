Make me a UI that works entirely online through a github codespace.


Tab-based interface. There is a main panel with a sidebar and a horizontal bar at the top that displays the tabs for selection.
Tab bar - You can select, reorder, x to remove it. When you click any of the files it appears in the main panel and appears as a new item on the tab bar.
Sidebar - File tree with folder support. Each folder has a dropdown arrow you can expand or collapse. No limits to nesting. Files can be the following types: txt, md, pdf, epub, csv. In this menu you can
- Create new folder
- Create new markdown file
- Drag and drop to move files or folders.
- Rename files and folders.
- When you click a file or folder it highlights.


When you click a file it shows in the main panel.
