**Changelog: Post-Debugging Delta — Sidebar Cells Module & Drag-and-Drop Functionality**

This changelog captures all changes made during the debugging session that were not present in the prior logged progress. It includes newly implemented logic, corrections, and structural improvements across `cells.js`, `storage.js`, and `styles.css`. Only net-new functionality is documented below; previously logged behaviors are excluded.

---

**\[Files Modified or Extended]**

1. **`cells.js`**

   **New Functional Logic Implemented:**

   * Full-path tracking for all folder and file `<li>` elements in the tree, using `dataset.path`.
   * Refactored `renderCellTree()` to:

     * Recursively pass `parentPath` to build accurate `itemPath`.
     * Set `dataset.path` and `draggable="true"` on each node.
     * Distinguish files (markdown) and folders (nested objects) explicitly via `typeof node === 'object'`.
   * Implemented `dragstart` on every `<li>`:

     ```js
     li.addEventListener('dragstart', e => {
       e.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', itemPath);
     });
     ```

   **Root-Level Drop Handling:**

   * Added `dragover`, `dragenter`, `dragleave`, and `drop` handlers on `#cell-tree` to act as a root-level drop target.
   * Drop zone activates only if `e.target` is outside any `.folder-item`.
   * `storage.moveItem()` is called with `destFolderPath === ''` for root insertion.
   * Visual feedback (via `root-drop-target` class) added on hover.

   **Drop onto Folder Logic:**

   * `dragover`, `dragleave`, and `drop` handlers added to folder `<li>` elements.
   * Visually highlights target folder on dragover via `drag-over` class.
   * On drop, invokes `storage.moveItem(srcPath, destPath)`.

   **Self-Drop and Inception Prevention:**

   * In folder `drop` handler, added validation to prevent:

     * Moving a folder into itself.
     * Moving a folder into one of its own descendants.

     ```js
     if (destPath === srcPath || destPath.startsWith(srcPath + '/')) return;
     ```

   **Folder Selection & UI Highlighting:**

   * Clicking a folder sets `currentFolderPath` and adds `.selected`.
   * Clicking outside any `.folder-item` deselects all.
   * When a folder is selected, new cells/folders are created under it.
   * If no folder is selected, new cells/folders are added at the root.

   **UI Event Binding:**

   * `blur` on cell editor textarea now re-invokes `loadContentIntoMainPanel()` with `type: 'cell'`, triggering re-render after save.

   **Toggle Arrow Behavior:**

   * Arrow element (`▶`/`▼`) added to each folder item.
   * Folder initially collapsed; toggling expands/collapses with icon and `aria-expanded`.

---

2. **`storage.js`**

   **New Functions and Enhancements:**

   * `moveItem(srcPath, destFolderPath)`

     * Extracts the full `srcPath` using `split('/')`, deletes node from parent, inserts into destination node.
     * Uses `getNode()` and `removeNode()` (inline or helper) to safely navigate JSON tree structure.
     * Handles root as `destFolderPath === ''`.

   * `getNode(tree, path)`

     * Traverses a nested object tree using path segments split by `/`.
     * Returns the reference to a specific nested folder object.

   * All mutations to tree structure are persisted via `persistCellTreeData()` after move operations.

   **Console Logging (for debugging purposes):**

   * Logs added to `moveItem`:

     * Source and destination paths.
     * Tree structure after removal and insertion.

---

3. **`styles.css`**

   **New Classes and Behavior:**

   * `.collapsed > ul` — hides nested lists in collapsed folders.
   * `.folder-toggle` — styled arrow toggle for folders.
   * `.folder-item.selected` — highlights the selected folder.
   * `.drag-over` — highlights drop targets when dragging over folders.
   * `#cell-tree.root-drop-target` — dashed outline when dragging over root-level drop area.

---

**\[Functionality Now Working]**

* Cells and folders correctly show hierarchical tree with toggle arrows.
* Folder expand/collapse works reliably.
* Folder selection highlights, and new cell/folder is created under selection.
* Clicking empty sidebar space clears selection.
* Markdown cell content re-renders immediately after blur/save.
* Drag-and-drop into folders moves files/folders correctly.
* Visual feedback appears during drag operations (folder highlight and root border).
* Dragging a file or folder into a subfolder works as expected.
* Duplicate tab prevention and tab focus switching function properly.

---

**\[Known Issues / Broken Behavior]**

1. **Dragging to Root (Empty Space Below Tree):**

   * Visual highlight of root drop target works correctly.
   * Console logs show `[Root Drop] src=... dest=root`.
   * `storage.moveItem()` is called.
   * **BUT:** file or folder does not visibly move from source to root.
   * Tree data in console shows nested item still inside source folder, not extracted.

2. **Inception Bug on Self-Drop:**

   * Guard clause is present in drop logic.
   * **BUT:** if paths are miscomputed or not normalized properly, deep nesting into self may still occur under certain conditions.

---

**\[Summary of Net Change Since Last Log]**

* Full drag-and-drop tree reordering logic added.
* File/folder movement via drag implemented and styled.
* Root-drop logic structured, styled, and logged—but final movement logic still broken.
* Self-drop prevention guards are present and partially effective.
* UI now supports folder selection, deselection, new cell creation inside folders, and persistent folder hierarchy with accurate tab behavior.
