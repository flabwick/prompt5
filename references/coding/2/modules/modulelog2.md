# 2
**Changelog: Post-Session Delta (Unlogged Changes Since Last Recorded Progress Log)**

---

**\[New Files Created]**

1. **`storage.js`**

   * Handles persistence of `cellTreeData` in `localStorage`.
   * Provides:

     * `loadCellTreeData()`: returns current tree.
     * `persistCellTreeData()`: saves to `localStorage`.
     * `getCellContent(filepath)`: navigates tree by path.
     * `saveCellContent(content, filepath)`: writes content and persists.

2. **`cells.js`**

   * Manages sidebar tree UI and editor for markdown cells.
   * Implements:

     * `initCellsSidebar()`: loads and renders tree UI from template.
     * `renderCellTree()`: recursively builds DOM structure for folder/file tree from object.
     * `openCellTab(filepath)`: opens tab and loads cell content.
     * `renderCellEditor(content, filepath)`: renders editable textarea with stub buttons.
     * `bindCellControls()`: handles new cell/folder creation via prompt and updates tree.

3. **`books.js`, `pdfs.js`, `chats.js`**

   * Stub placeholders for future implementation.
   * Each injects a simple placeholder message into `#sidebar-content`.

**\[Files Modified]**

1. **`index.html`**

   * `<script>` block updated to include all new files in correct order:

     * `storage.js`, `markdown.js`, `uploader.js`, `cells.js`, `books.js`, `pdfs.js`, `chats.js`, `main.js`.

2. **`main.js`**

   * Now only includes:

     * Global state: `openTabs`, `panels`.
     * UI bootstrap: `initUI()`, `initDataFetch()`.
     * Tab manager: `openTab()`, `switchTab()`, `closeTab()`, `loadContentIntoMainPanel()`.
     * Sidebar dispatcher: `toggleSidebar()` routes `panelName` to appropriate module (`initCellsSidebar`, etc).
   * All cell-specific logic extracted to `cells.js`.

---

**\[Files Maintained or Unchanged]**

* `server.js`: No modifications.
* `styles.css`: No noted change during this interaction.

---

**\[Functionality Implemented]**

* Cell sidebar template injected dynamically.
* Recursive rendering of folder and file tree.
* New folder/cell creation supported via prompt, reflected live in tree and persisted in `localStorage`.
* Tabs open per cell file and maintain uniqueness (`openTabs` registry).
* Markdown content saved on blur, correctly restored on page refresh.
* Tabs support close and drag-reordering.
* Placeholder UI for EPUB, PDF, Chat modules.

---

**\[Verified Working]**

* Cell content edits persist to localStorage and are restored after reload.
* Reopening the same cell file does not open a duplicate tab.
* Sidebar state (files/folders) is restored correctly after refresh.
* Tab switching, creation, and reordering is functional and stable.
* Basic layout and tab styles render as expected.

---

**\[Known Issues / Observed Bugs]**

1. **Main Panel Placeholder Override**

   * After clicking away from a cell tab and switching back, `#main-panel` shows `"Panel content for cell:<filename>"` instead of cell editor UI.
   * This happens due to fallback logic in `main.js:loadContentIntoMainPanel()` not distinguishing tab types.

2. **Folder Interactivity Broken**

   * Folders in the tree do not toggle visibility of children reliably.
   * `collapsed` class toggle exists, but `ul` subtree is not styled to hide on collapse.
   * Folders do not act as drop targets, making organization ineffective.
   * Folder clicks do not open or expand content properly unless directly managed.

3. **Drag-and-Drop for Tree Items Not Implemented**

   * Tree does not support drag-to-move for cell files.
   * No logic implemented to move files into folders or update data paths.
   * `dragDropTreeHandler()` from the plan is missing entirely.

4. **UI Bug â€“ Main Panel Editor Persistence**

   * If a tab is open for a file, switching to it does not re-render the cell editor.
   * Instead, placeholder content is displayed due to generic fallback in `loadContentIntoMainPanel()`.

5. **No Rename/Delete Support Yet**

   * Tree items cannot be renamed or deleted.
   * No UI bindings or file system logic yet implemented for these operations.

---

**\[Summary of Net Change vs. Previous Log]**

* Entire Cells sidebar and tab interaction logic implemented and extracted into `cells.js` and `storage.js`.
* Sidebar rendering, tab uniqueness, editor save/persist logic functioning.
* Folder UI present but non-functional for nesting/organization.
* Tab content fallback logic incomplete for cell context.
* Drag/drop and rename/delete planned features not yet implemented.
