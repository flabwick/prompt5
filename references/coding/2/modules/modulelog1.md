I have created a github codespace with nothing in it yet.


# 1
**Changelog: Module 1 Implementation (Post-Session Update)**

This changelog outlines all new additions and modifications made during the session, compared to the prior state where only a Codespace had been created with no files or structure. It documents file additions, content written, and functional behavior, and clearly distinguishes what is working versus what requires revision.

---

**\[New Files Created]**

1. **`server.js`**

   * Implements a minimal HTTP server using Node's `http`, `fs`, and `path` modules.
   * Static file server supports:

     * `index.html`
     * `main.js`
     * `styles.css`
     * Anything in `/assets/`, `/data/`, `/templates/`
   * API handler stub responds to:

     * `/api/cells`, `/api/books`, `/api/pdfs`, `/api/chats`, `/api/mail`
     * All return `501 Not Implemented` with correct JSON error payload.
   * Working as expected based on `curl` test results. All routes correctly return:

     ```json
     {"error":"GET /api/<route> not implemented"}
     ```

2. **`index.html`**

   * Defines UI shell:

     * Sidebar with five toggle buttons (Cells, Books, PDFs, Chats, Mail)
     * Top bar container (`#tab-bar`)
     * Main display panel (`#main-panel`)
   * References `main.js` and `styles.css`
   * Renders correctly; sidebar displays as intended.

3. **`styles.css`**

   * Implements full layout CSS:

     * Sidebar fixed to left
     * Top bar (tab area) spans horizontal row above main content
     * Main panel scrollable and padded
     * Placeholder styles for `.tab`, `.button`, `.panel`, `.tab.active`
   * Visually effective except `.tab` is unused (see "Issues" section)

4. **`main.js`**

   * Defines global `openTabs` and `panels`
   * Binds sidebar buttons to load `/templates/placeholder.html` dynamically into `#sidebar-content`
   * Stubs for:

     * `openTab(id, title)`
     * `switchTab(id)`
     * `initDataFetch()` fetches `/api/*` endpoints and logs results
   * Fetch to template file and data endpoints confirmed working
   * JS executes with no syntax errors, but tab-related functions are not triggered by UI (see "Issues" below)

5. **`/templates/placeholder.html`**

   * Basic template:

     ```html
     <div class="panel placeholder">Coming soon</div>
     ```
   * Dynamically injected into sidebar content area on toggle
   * Works correctly; replaced with `Coming soon: <panel>` label in runtime

---

**\[New Directories Created]**

* `/assets/icons/`
* `/assets/images/`
* `/data/cells/`
* `/data/bookcells/`
* `/data/books/`
* `/data/pdfs/`
* `/data/chats/`
* `/templates/`

All directories are required for further file-based data management and render no issues in static serving logic.

---

**\[Working As Expected]**

* **Backend**

  * Server starts, logs port
  * Static serving for root, assets, data, templates works
  * All `/api/*` endpoints return 501 with structured error JSON

* **Frontend**

  * Sidebar is functional and injects placeholder content
  * Placeholder HTML template loads and interpolates panel name
  * No runtime JS errors
  * Basic layout renders as described in plan
  * CSS applies to sidebar, main panel, layout grid

---

**\[Issues and Required Fixes]**

1. **Tabs Do Not Appear in UI**

   * `openTab()` and `switchTab()` are implemented but not connected to any user actions.
   * No call is made to `openTab()` from `toggleSidebar()` or sidebar clicks.
   * **Fix Required**: Add logic in `toggleSidebar(panelName)` to call `openTab(panelName, Title)`.

2. **All Console 501 Errors**

   * These are expected given stubbed API endpoints.
   * Do **not** require fix; validation of backend structure.

3. **`.tab.active` Styles Not Observable**

   * Because no tabs are rendered, the styling logic is not demonstrable.
   * This will be resolved automatically once tab rendering is fixed.

---

**\[Summary of State Change from Previous Log]**

Previous state: No files or directories.
Current state: Fully built project skeleton with working server, UI shell, routing logic, and static asset/template loader.

---

**Next Steps**

* Wire up `openTab()` to sidebar toggle or other UI event
* Begin implementation of actual content managers (CellsManager, BookManager, etc.) in `main.js`
* Integrate tab-content-specific rendering under `#main-panel`
* Gradually replace placeholders with actual dynamic panels
