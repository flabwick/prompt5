ISSUES:

1) folders and files do not show as nested. It should be indented to show visually the hierarchy.
2) You cannot drag and drop a file from within a folder to the root. When you drag to the root, the background around the root highlights, but when you drop it, the folder just closes and the file just stays in the folder.
3) folders can be nested within themselves. This is a pretty bad glitch, I have this folder which is nested within itself in an infinite loop.
4) I was able to open the same markdown file twice as two separate tabs. THere was a conflict and my progress was deleted.
