# MODULE 1
I have created a codespace on Github, at this point there is nothing but a readme file.

The session completed the entire planned file and directory structure for the application, matching the required module spec exactly. All directories, entrypoints, UI components, stub logic, placeholder files, and CSS scaffolding have been established and are verifiable by automated testing. No functional app logic, data handling, dynamic rendering, or user interaction is present—only static structure, placeholder code, and minimal visual styling. The project is ready for feature implementation without requiring structural refactoring. All foundational technical debt for architecture, modularity, and future extension is now resolved.

# MODULE 2
## 2.1

* **Functional UI:** The sidebar is now fully interactive, with always-visible "New Cell" and "New Folder" buttons, a persistent and visually clear file/folder tree, and drag-and-drop for reorganization.
* **Resizable Sidebar:** Users can adjust the sidebar width with a handle, and the main panel layout dynamically updates with no visual gaps.
* **Visual Feedback:** Indentation and DnD highlighting are robust and consistent for both root and nested folders.
* **Core CRUD and Navigation:** Creating, renaming, deleting, and moving files/folders work for basic and shallow cases.
* **Major Glitch (Remaining):** Drag-and-drop into folders within folders (i.e., nested moves) can cause deletion or loss of whole subtrees, indicating a flaw in move logic (likely self/descendant protection or node reparenting).
* **What Doesn't Work:**

  * Nested drag-and-drop may delete data if not handled carefully.
  * Move protection logic for descendant checks is unreliable and must be rewritten for safety.
  * No persistent backend—still in-memory only.
  * No markdown editing, embedding, or AI chat yet.

**The project has moved from scaffold to a mostly working sidebar file manager UI, but has critical correctness issues remaining for complex drag-and-drop and deep folder operations.**
## 2.2

This session focused entirely on resolving the drag-and-drop unreliability within the nested folder/file sidebar system. Structural refactors consolidated all DnD logic into one location (sidebarEvents.js) and moved away from fragile DOM traversals. Accurate paths are now emitted directly from drag source nodes, and the filesystem’s path resolution logic is now in sync with the UI.

However, while the structural logic is now clean and centralized, fundamental DnD behavior remains broken for nested scenarios. File and folder moves are still glitchy and misfire depending on nesting depth or UI interaction. The sidebar UI remains functional for viewing, editing, and creating content, but DnD movement — a core feature — is still not robust.

As of now, the file manager is operational with basic features, but drag-and-drop integrity across arbitrary nesting levels remains incomplete.

## 2.3
The session resolved all six issues from the original debugging plan, achieving functional correctness in isolation. The in-memory file system, folder tree structure, and move/rename protections are now robust and verifiably pass all programmatic tests. Cell open/close state is tracked, and the system maintains consistency across rename and move operations.

However, the UI’s drag-and-drop functionality has regressed. While the backend logic and sidebar rendering are structurally correct, no drag operations succeed in the browser, indicating a disconnect between UI event dispatch and the logic layer. All button-based operations and context menus continue to function. The root cause is likely module timing or ESM cycle introduced via cellRegistry import within fileSystem.js.

The project has reached functional parity in testing, but critical interactive DnD behavior in the UI is currently broken.
