# 1
**CHANGELOG**

---

**/core/fileSystem.js**

* Refactored for compatibility with both browser and Node.js environments.
* Removed direct use of `window` for event emission, introduced a listener array and `onCellsChanged()` for callbacks.
* Added `__resetAll()` for tests to clear the in-memory filesystem.
* API logic for CRUD operations, move, and tree listing remains in-memory only.
* Logic for move and delete operations unchanged from original but no longer assumes presence of browser APIs in all environments.

---

**/core/liveSync.js, /core/treeBuilder.js, /state/cellRegistry.js, /state/globalState.js, /utils/id.js, /ui/contextMenu.js**

* No substantive changes, except `/ui/contextMenu.js` was improved for reliable callback invocation and removal on action click, including support for both ESM and CommonJS imports.
* `/ui/contextMenu.js` has styling and robust event isolation for menu close/callback.

---

**/src/sidebar.js**

* Sidebar rendering restructured to always display persistent "New Cell" and "New Folder" buttons at the top, with file tree below.
* Context menu logic for root-level creation removed; now only the persistent buttons are used for root file/folder creation.
* Drag-and-drop, click, and context menu event bindings updated for new sidebar layout and persistently rendered controls.
* Handles sidebar update and tab open events.

---

**/ui/createSidebar.js**

* Refactored to always display "New Cell" and "New Folder" buttons at the top, followed by a separator line, and then the file tree below.
* The empty-state UI and context-menu-on-background logic were removed.
* Persistent buttons now trigger file creation in the root directory via direct file system calls.
* Added a vertical sidebar resize handle (`.sidebar-resize-handle`) at the right edge, using mouse drag to adjust the sidebar's width.
* Drag-over root highlighting logic preserved for visual DnD feedback.

---

**/ui/createFolderTree.js**

* Fully reworked to render a true vertical tree, with each folder/file as a vertical list item under its parent.
* The label/row for each node is indented using padding on the label container only, not the whole node.
* Expand/collapse logic restructured: only child nodes of the toggled folder rerender, not the entire tree.
* Drag-and-drop is handled with per-node listeners for dragstart, dragover, dragleave, and drop events.
* On drop, moves are performed with `fileSystem.move()`, and sidebar update callbacks are invoked.
* Drag state is tracked with a module-level variable (`dragPath`) for reliable event handling across recursive tree structure.
* Drop on folder only allowed if not a descendant of itself; intended to block invalid moves.
* Move/expand/collapse logic is now robust for both shallow and deep trees, though issues remain.

---

**/events/bindings/sidebarEvents.js**

* Updated to support DnD for root and non-root targets.
* Dragover and drop events on the sidebar background allow moving files/folders to the root directory.
* Folder nodes highlight on dragover using `.tree-node-drag-over`.

---

**/ui/styles/sidebar.css**

* Updated for a full flexbox-based layout.
* Ensured sidebar, main panel, and tabs layout correctly without visual gaps after resizing.
* Added robust styling for `.tree-node`, `.tree-node-row`, `.tree-node-drag-over`, `.sidebar-resize-handle`, and `.sidebar-drag-over-root` for DnD visual feedback and resizer affordance.
* Vertical tree style and indentation on labels are enforced, with no horizontal shifting of entire subtrees.
* Sidebar always remains visible; main panel flexes to fill available space.

---

**/style.css**

* Added or modified `#app-root`, `#sidebar`, and `#main-container` to use flexbox for proper sidebar resizing and main content alignment.

---

**Drag-and-drop behavior**

* Files and folders can be dragged into folders or into the root.
* DnD highlights both root drop area and folder targets.
* Persistent glitches remain when moving nodes to deeply nested locations; moves into folders within folders may cause node disappearance or entire subtrees to be lost (bug present in current move logic, especially on self/descendant protection or tree invalidation).

---

**Other files**

* No changes to `/core/liveSync.js`, `/core/treeBuilder.js`, `/state/cellRegistry.js`, `/state/globalState.js`, `/utils/id.js`.

# 2
CHANGELOG

⸻

/core/treeBuilder.js
Edited
	•	Added recursive path annotation to every file and folder returned by fileSystem.listTree('/').
	•	Each node in the returned tree now includes a path property constructed by combining parent and current name, enabling accurate DnD source/destination resolution.
	•	Fix resolves prior issue where only root-level nodes had reliable paths, breaking nested drag-and-drop logic.

⸻

/utils/debounce.js
Created
	•	Introduced a general-purpose debounce(fn, delay) utility function.
	•	Used to reduce redundant re-renders from rapid filesystem events (cells-changed).
	•	Default delay: 100ms; cancels previous invocations if called again before delay expires.

⸻

/src/sidebar.js
Edited
	•	Imported and applied debounce to renderSidebar() to create debouncedRenderSidebar.
	•	Replaced all direct calls to renderSidebar() with debouncedRenderSidebar() throughout sidebar event bindings and UI update callbacks.
	•	Registered debouncedRenderSidebar with fileSystem.onCellsChanged() to throttle filesystem-based UI refreshes.

⸻

/ui/createFolderTree.js
Edited
	•	Removed all per-node drag event listeners: dragstart, dragover, dragleave, and drop.
	•	Retained el.draggable = true on each .tree-node to keep elements draggable.
	•	Added new dragstart handler using e.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', node.path) to store the exact dragged path, decoupling drag state from DOM inspection.
	•	Ensures accurate tracking of drag source, even in nested folder structures.

⸻

/events/bindings/sidebarEvents.js
Edited
	•	Replaced imprecise dragstart logic using e.target.closest('.tree-node') with extraction of path from e.dataTransfer.getData('text/plain'), matching the new createFolderTree drag initiation.
	•	Replaced all drag/drop logic with centralized, delegated handling on the sidebar container:
	•	On dragover, highlights valid folder or root targets.
	•	On drop, prevents invalid self/descendant moves.
	•	Resolves dragPath only via the payload in the dataTransfer.
	•	Removed all reliance on DOM traversal for determining drag/drop origin or target.
	•	Ensures correctness of move operations and eliminates misfires (e.g., accidentally moving a parent folder when attempting to drag a child).

⸻

/ui/createSidebar.js
Edited
	•	No functional DnD logic added here, but redundant dragover, dragleave, and drop handlers that previously attempted root highlighting were kept for styling purposes.
	•	These now coexist with the centralized handling in sidebarEvents.js.

⸻

General DnD Logic (Structural Refactor Summary)
	•	Previous fragmented drag-and-drop handling (spread across createFolderTree.js, sidebarEvents.js, and inline event listeners) has been consolidated.
	•	All DnD state, validation, and move logic are now defined in one place under sidebarEvents.js, with exact source path embedded at drag time.
	•	Invalid drops (e.g., self, descendant) are blocked both in UI and backend (fileSystem.move() with isDescendant() check).
	•	UI still fails to execute some valid operations due to unknown DOM interaction or event suppression issues.

⸻

What Still Fails
	•	File and folder drag-and-drop operations continue to behave inconsistently in practice:
	•	Moving a file from one nested folder into another nested folder does nothing.
	•	Dragging a nested folder often triggers a move of the wrong ancestor node (e.g., dragging folder2 causes folder1 to move).
	•	These symptoms persist despite centralized logic, suggesting deeper issues possibly in DOM event bubbling, element targeting, or dataTransfer availability within delegated handlers.

# 3

CHANGELOG

⸻

/core/fileSystem.js
	•	Edited:
	•	Rewrote isDescendant() to perform accurate segment-wise path comparison instead of prefix matching, preventing false positives when checking self/descendant move validity.
	•	Added deepCloneNode() utility to ensure structural immutability during move operations, preventing unintentional mutations or loss of nodes.
	•	Updated move() method:
	•	Now uses deepCloneNode() before assigning the moved node to the new location.
	•	Integrates cellRegistry.renamePath(srcPath, destPath) to synchronize open tab state when a move occurs.
	•	Preserved the in-memory model. All changes affect only frontend state.
	•	Functional in test environment; however, inclusion of cellRegistry introduces side effects in browser where ESM cycles or runtime execution order may not be guaranteed.
	•	What works:
	•	Safe moves across the tree.
	•	Protected against self/descendant and name conflicts.
	•	Emits cells-changed event.
	•	What doesn’t:
	•	After cellRegistry integration, UI sidebar’s drag-and-drop no longer works (most likely due to ESM circular import or duplicated in-memory state across test/runtime environments).

⸻

/state/cellRegistry.js
	•	Rewritten:
	•	Added open tab tracking (openTabs) and selection tracking (selectedPath).
	•	Methods:
	•	openCell(path), closeCell(path), getOpenTabs(), getSelectedPath(), renamePath(old, new), and reset().
	•	State is in-memory singleton used across UI/tab logic.
	•	What works:
	•	Tracks open and selected cells.
	•	Integrates successfully with test suite.
	•	Responds to rename and move operations (when called).
	•	What doesn’t:
	•	External use (such as inside fileSystem.js) may introduce lifecycle timing issues in the browser.

⸻

/events/bindings/sidebarEvents.js
	•	Edited:
	•	Drop handler now uses try/catch with alert(err.message) and console.error() for all failed moves.
	•	dragstart sets path using e.dataTransfer.setData(...), fully replacing dragPath global tracking.
	•	dragover and drop conditionals rely solely on paths from dataTransfer.
	•	Self/descendant moves properly blocked.
	•	What works:
	•	Error feedback shown on invalid operations.
	•	DOM targeting for .tree-folder now decoupled from move state.
	•	Refactored to avoid reliance on global dragPath state.
	•	What doesn’t:
	•	No longer receives valid move signals in browser context (likely due to misaligned event handler timing, missing drag context or faulty event propagation from UI).

⸻

/ui/createFolderTree.js
	•	Edited:
	•	Fully removed all local drag-and-drop logic (dragPath tracking, per-node drop, dragover, etc.).
	•	Retained draggable=true and correct data-path/data-type attributes on each .tree-node.
	•	What works:
	•	Clean structural rendering of tree nodes.
	•	Delegates all event logic to sidebarEvents.js.
	•	What doesn’t:
	•	Since local handlers were removed, correct event propagation is now strictly dependent on sidebar binding — which is currently broken in live UI.

⸻

/src/sidebar.js
	•	Edited:
	•	Fully delegates re-renders to renderSidebar() and debouncedRenderSidebar.
	•	Connects to fileSystem.onCellsChanged(...).
	•	All interactions with the filesystem (create, delete, rename, move) now trigger UI refresh.
	•	What works:
	•	Creation and deletion from buttons or context menu.
	•	Sidebar re-renders after file changes or tree updates.
	•	What doesn’t:
	•	UI drag-and-drop operations don’t trigger file moves anymore (events appear not to fire or be consumed silently).

⸻

/tests/verifySessionFixes.test.js
	•	New file:
	•	Covers all six bugfixes across sidebar DnD, move integrity, open tab state, and error conditions.
	•	Includes assertions with custom assert() and [PASS]/[FAIL] logs.
	•	Calls fileSystem.move() and cellRegistry.renamePath() manually for test control.
	•	Fully passes after final fixes applied.
	•	What works:
	•	All move and rename logic is verified in isolation.
	•	Subtree preservation and error catching work as expected.
	•	Registry state changes confirmed.
	•	What doesn’t:
	•	Test environment does not capture DOM or UI event regressions, meaning browser-side DnD bug went undetected.

⸻
