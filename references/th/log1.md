My current use with weed is very consistent. It has a lot to do with my current eating and sleeping habits. It's accessible dopamine that I've gotten used to having.

Immediately after stopping, I feel a lot more emotional, my appetite goes away completely and sleep becomes a lot a lot harder.


I love weed. Quitting is like breaking up with a girlfriend. It's not like I experience withdrawal symptoms, but late at night I think about it the same way you might think about your ex at night. The difference is this ex girlfriend is still in love with me and I'm still in love with her.

It's at the center of my motivations a little bit. A young person in the world right now deals with a lot of difficult emotional problems. I don't know what my purpose is, I'm young and inexperienced, I'm super busy and having trouble balancing things, I want a girlfriend. There are all these pressures on me, the pressure to do well in school, the pressure to not fuck up at work, internal pressure that I have on myself and my own purpose. After a long day of dealing with all of that, weed helps me feel secure.

Like having that security as a safety net. It makes me less insecure, and less reliant on other's opinions. On quitting I usually feel a lot more insecure and lonely, more reliant on other's opinions.

I'd sort of compare it to having a loving family at home. After a long day of stress, you have the security to fail and fall back to the loving and unjudgemental arms of your family. Once you lose that there's a risk aversion that comes of that when you're out in the world. Same with weed, without it I feel a lot less secure about my own life because I'm so lonely and anxious.

I used to be on fluoxetine but I stopped. Should I go back?

In terms of the girlfriend thing: I'm using weed it as an excuse to avoid trying, and yes it's probably becoming a reason to stop trying to find a girlfriend. I really want a girlfriend but exposing myself to them feels needy. There's something wrong in my head about trying to escalate with someone to the point of sex. I don't seem to really get that tbh like how am I supposed to get to fucking her from a point of not knowing her?

I used to have a girlfriend named Sophia. I dated her for three years beginning in the pandemic in year 10 and ending when I graduated school in year 12. She had a really huge influence on my life. My parents were always supportive but it always seemed conditional. They were very good at not being mad at me, but being disppointed. Their standards are high and I valued their opinion of me so much. Sophia was the first person who I didn't really have to worry about that with. To be honest, she wasn't that attractive. She had a cute smile but she was overweight. I was attracted to her smile and I found her personality to be really endearing. I think deep down it's made me a little insecure. I was definitely dating below my league in terms of a looks stand point. I think that shows a lack of confidence in myself. Equally, I think this choice being fully personality-based made breaking up with her so damn hard. Everyone else, including my parents, I had to give this intelligent and confident image that I really like but that is also exhausting to maintain. But not with her. I think partially because she wasn't very attractive I felt secure that I didn't need to impress her. It really hurt to end that.

Then I moved to Sydney. I lived in a sharehouse with a bunch of people but I had these two mates Yevin and Zayne. We smoked chronic amounts of weed together and I learned a lot from Zayne in particular. There was a confidence and unashamededness to him that I admired. We smoked all the time and didn't care what others thought of us. When we went out to drink, we all pretended to enjoy it, but deep down I think we were all waiting to smash cones and chill when we got home. My best memories really came from that living room we smoked in. Best memories of friendship, freedom and security. I haven't really been able to feel that same way since.

Going into Sydney I had a lot of anxiety. About making friends, whether people around are going to accept me or not.

Last time I quit I kind of went crazy after a few weeks. For the reasons above, loneliness, boredom, insecurity. It's like finally confronting the reality of how shit life really is, not just living in the bliss I was in.
## 12:00PM

Ok you're right. I like being around people who I don't have to impress. Often-times that requires being around certain types of people who are unjudgemental. That in itself is kind of transactional and about leverege.

So to tell you the truth I guess I don't feel safe about myself. I think highly of myself, I think I'm good looking and very intelligent. But I guess I still outsource my worth to things like weed and the approval of others.


To tell you the truth, I don't really know what the point of life is. Weed helps me tolerate it because it kind of gives me a purpose in a way. A reason to tolerate the shit throughout the day is to reward myself at the end with a nice cone. We live to work and then work until we die, it feels like a pleasure that takes a little bit of the pain out of the reality

Ok yes I do want validation from someone, I want security and emotional support. Companionship.

It sounds really easy when you say it like that, but being "yourself" is a complicated task. I'm only 20, so to be honest I don't know who I am and I have a lot of changing left to do. 

Being yourself is the enemy of self-improvement. Growing up I was really shy and anti-social, but I still felt lonely. It took a lot of effort, embarrassment and pissing people off to come out of my shell. In that sense, I was behaving to try and change my personality from super quiet and non-confrontational to someone who can actually speak to strangers and hold a conversation. I'm glad I went through all of that early because now I don't feel that same pressure to change and I like that I'm not the same non-confrontational person I used to be.

To be honest, I have no idea what I want in a partner. My insides tell me that I should just find someone exactly like Sophia to replace that, but I think that part of me might not be worth following. Sophia was good but she never really challenged me. I've never dated someone who really challenged me or someone I've really had to fight for, so I don't know what that's like but it sounds a lot better.

If I never found a girlfriend in general that would really suck. Maybe I'm more worried about being stuck without one when it really matters. I feel like on some level everyone wants a boyfriend/girlfriend so maybe a lot of it is just my insides telling me what to do out of instinct.

These are all very difficult questions.

I think having a more attractive girlfriend would make me feel better about myself. 

You say that finding a girlfriend who challenges me is conditional love. That's really interesting, I didn't think of it like that. But is it really a bad thing for love to be conditional? Growth often requires someone to give you perspective. If my parents' love wasn't subtly conditional, I probably wouldn't be who I am today. What do you mean about performance and growth as well? What if this girlfriend who challenges me reveals parts of myself that I didn't know I had access to.

I don't know I actually don't feel a lot of insecurity about myself. Like there are habits I talk about in therapy here that I don't like such as my weed use, but for the most part I feel good feelings about myself. When I see myself in the mirror I like what I see, when I talk to people I'm happy with my personality and how I am. I'm content with myself and my existence, even though I'm really lost about how I should go about it. I think all this talk about me changing who I am is more a product of being young and the struggles associated with identity and that.

I'm a high value guy and I know I can be lovable even if I don't change a bit. But yes, I don't know what I need from myself to feel happy and that seems to tie in a little bit.

The goal is getting a girlfriend, I'm not ashamed to admit that. I do want someone in my life. I just have no idea how to go about it. If I didn't have this goal of getting a girlfriend I wouldn't have any motivation to actually speak to girls. If I didn't want a girlfriend why would I go out to bars when I don't want to or speak to girls in my classes when I feel nervous. If I didn't want a girlfriend I think frankly I just wouldn't speak to girls ever and I definitely won't get a girlfriend.

Maybe I don't even like women that much. It's a difficult thing to admit, but it might be true.

I think it's partially tied to a dislike for superficial relationships like acquaintences and that. As much as weak ties are supposed to be good for networking and that, I find it takes a lot of effort that I don't really want to put in. 

Even for men, if I meet them I don't feel a motivation to put in heaps of extra effort to continue being friends with them outside of whatever situation I met them in. I have enough platonic friends and I think the cliquiness of Canberra makes it really difficult to break into groups that you're not already in. But with girls I do feel a motivation to continue the relationship beyond the superficial circumstances it may have been born in. This effort is uncomfortable and subject to rejection, which I obviously find uncomfortable. If I didn't feel nervous or butterflies she probably doesn't attract me enough. Like I think I want a girlfriend who I'm really attracted to, this is important to me. Sophia gave me emotional security, but I wasn't all that attracted to her so that influenced my relationship with her a little bit.

## 2:30PM

I do want to try really hard towards something. I do want to choose and commit to something and then let myself be inadequate so I can improve. I love working towards a goal, it gives me purpose and a reason to get up. But the issue is I don't know what I want, I don't know which direction to go.

I heard a saying, a car is easier to steer once you've already started moving in any direction. I want to start working towards something not because I want to decide and settle on it now, but because action produces information and even with failure I'll learn a lot about myself.

The problem is I have all of these thoughts in my head about what I want and it's quite hard to filter through it since I can be anything I want to be, but I can't be all of it at once.
