I am a 5'11 basketball player. I'm light, about 65kg. I want to get better at playing.

Strenghts
- I have a 190cm wingspan so I'm pretty long
- Can jump pretty high
- Can shoot
- Handles are ok
- Defence is pretty bad to be honest.
- Rebounding good for my size.

I want to get better in a way that doesn't require reps and practice. Like stuff you can learn during the game to increase your IQ and based more about your playstyle. I think I have enough skills.
