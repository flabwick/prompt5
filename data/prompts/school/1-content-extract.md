Analyze the source material and extract curriculum units based strictly on its content. For each unit, label the unit clearly and classify it as one of the following: Tier 1 (Directly Tested) – appears in problem sets or is emphasized in a way that indicates it will be directly examined; Tier 2 (Supportive) – supports Tier 1 topics conceptually or procedurally and may be indirectly examined; Tier 3 (Non-Essential) – covered in the source but not tested or emphasized. For each unit, write a paragraph that describes the skill types and applications. Be as explicit as possible here, exhausting all the kinds of exam questions they might ask and what skills they may require. Only include units and details that are explicitly present in the material. Avoid generalizations or advanced topics not clearly supported by the source. Write your final response in the chat.
