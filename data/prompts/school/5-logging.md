THE SESSION ENDS HERE. Read the entire session and think deeply about the user's input ("you said"). Do not count Chatgpt's input ("ChatGPT said"). Determine the student's current level of understanding, noting particular weaknesses and also the units and topics that WEREN'T covered in the section. Be clear about the skill level and types I showed, whether conceptual, graphical or calculations. Be as clear as possible and write your response in a block of text. Don't cite any specific questions or parts of the session, write in terms of what my current understanding might be at. Write as an estimate of what my understanding and strengths and weaknesses are, not as a definitive report. Take into account the information that was given to me in hints and lessons prior to giving my input. If I answer something correct instantly, assume proficiency, but if I answer something correct after a few mistakes or hints, assume less proficiency. Structure your response by the units covered and under each unit be specific about my progress. Focus just on what was done in this very session, nothing more. Your response should be around 500 words. Finally, give a percentage rating of my understanding of the specific unit I studied, with 0% being a complete beginner and 100% indicating mastery.
