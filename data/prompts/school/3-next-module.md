I will send you two documents, a curriculum and a progress log. Your task is to compare the progress with the curriculum and respond with a report that describes my current understanding and my coverage over the course. Go through and give all the units in the curriculum scores out of 10 that describes my understanding (10 meaning complete mastery). Then, recommend a module of a few units that I will focus on in my next few hours of study.
