SOURCE: [substitutes/1].

	1.	List 4 core arguments or themes in the source.
	2.	For each, explain:
	•	What is being argued?
	•	What evidence is used?
	•	How does it support, extend, or complicate your assignment?

Be as explicit as possible, tell me exactly what the author is saying in the source and with what evidence or logic. Everything should be an unbroken logical link with NO AMBIGUITY OR ASSUMPTION.

Use quotes and passages extracted directly from the source. Reference where in the passage you got each bit from.
