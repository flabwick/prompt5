	1.	Identify 3 assumptions the author makes.
	2.	For each:
	•	Is the assumption valid or biased?
	•	Does it strengthen or weaken the argument?
	•	What would change if the assumption were removed?

Be as explicit as possible, tell me exactly what the author is saying in the source and with what evidence or logic. Everything should be an unbroken logical link with NO AMBIGUITY OR ASSUMPTION.

Use quotes and passages extracted directly from the source. Reference where in the passage you got each bit from.
