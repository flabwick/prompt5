Dictated Questions from ECON2101 Tutorial 7 Week 8
	1.	Does this firm exhibit increasing, diminishing, or constant marginal product in each of its inputs?
	2.	Does this firm exhibit increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale?
	3.	Draw the isoquants for this firm.
	4.	What is the rate of technical substitution at K = 6, L = 3?
	5.	What is the rate of technical substitution at generic levels of capital and labour?
	6.	For r = 1, w = 4, and target quantity Q = 12, what is the cost-minimising level of capital and labour (in the long-run)? How much does this cost?
	7.	For generic r, w, and Q, what is this cost-minimising level of capital and labour (in the long-run)? What is the Long-Run Total Cost function? Graph this in Q-$ space.
 a) Check that this function makes sense by thinking about increases in r and w.
	8.	What are the (Long-run) Average Cost and Marginal Cost functions? Graph these.
	9.	Fix the input prices at r = 1, w = 4 and level of capital at K₀ = 24/∛2. What is the short-run optimal labour input for a given Q? What are the short-run total cost, average cost, and marginal cost functions (for generic Q)? Add the short-run average cost and marginal cost with K = 24/∛2 to your graph from part 8.
	10.	If demand for this firm’s product falls, and they can now sell only 10 units of the good (instead of 12), what would you advise this firm to do?

Homework: Work through a similar exercise for F(K, L) = K¹/²L¹/². Your results should be a little neater, but the process follows the same pattern.
