SPEAKER 1
OK, yeah, let's do it. OK, we, oh yes, we're after there, good.

SPEAKER 2
OK, um, well, look, um, welcome everyone, and I'll begin by acknowledging traditional owners and pay my respects to their elders past, present, emerging. We're very, uh, honoured today to have Selmann Cornish, um, Selwyn's a long standing, Uh, Member of economics, uh, and economic history here at the Australian National University, also occupied very senior roles within the university such as Dean of Students, uh, so is the, the official historian of the Reserve Bank of Australia, so there could be no one better qualified to uh explain the rise of central banking in Australia, and I know that when, Uh, particularly when someone first gave this lecture, it was also an eye-opener for me. I learned for the first time really, the, the mechanisms by which, um, the RBA for instance, uh, was able to, to, to actually fix interest rates, you know, these kinds of concepts we perhaps take for granted, but which we really need, um, expertise such as Selwyn's to untangle for us. So very grateful again, Selwyn, for you, once again, lecturing us, uh, in this course. Uh, there will be an opportunity for. Questions at the, at the end. So please, please feel free, uh, for those who are listening, uh, elsewhere, um, the notes for this lecture are now accessible online on Wattle. OK. Folks, you've obviously got hard copy, but there is also an online version of that, um, on, on Wattle if you want to consult it there. Um, so without further ado, so I went over to you.

SPEAKER 1
Good, thanks thanks very much, Frank, and, uh, Frank and I have known each other for. A long, a long time, 35 years it seemed like yesterday, so, um, time goes quickly. Um, I, I'm, I'm going to stick very closely to, um, uh, to the notes that, um, have been, um, uh, distributed. Um, so you, you may not have to take, uh, notes yourselves. Uh, on the other hand, you know, I don't want to stop you from taking your own, your own notes, but, um, I, I am gonna follow, uh, fairly closely, um, what I've written here. Um, a, a, a few general comments to, uh, and by the way, if, um, if, if you can't hear me, could you just stick up your hand? I, I've got some hearing aids, and I can hear my voice very loud, but people tell me that, um, my voice is rather soft, uh, when, uh, other people are listening to me. So, if you can't hear me, let me know. Um, some, um, introductory comments, uh, just to begin with, um, just about banks, there are different types of banks, um, there, there are commercial banks, uh, trading banks, savings banks, the sort of banks that we, Uh, we used to, um, uh, put our spare money in deposits and, uh, uh, take out loans and so on, um, your Westpac's, uh, NABs and so on. Um, there are also what Americans call investment banks. They're banks that mainly deal with, uh, with corporations, with businesses. I suppose Macquarie Bank in Australia is an example of an, an Australian investment bank, but Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and so on, the, the, the sort of international investment banks. Um Also, in some countries, particularly developing countries, um, they talk about national banks which are um are um government owned, um, commercial banks. And then there are central banks which will be the main focus of the lecture and particularly Australia's central bank. As well as banks, there are, uh, what, um, central bankers in particular, uh, in Australia anyway, call non-banks. Um, these, uh, building societies, uh, credit unions, finance companies, um, they act a bit like banks, but, um, um, but they're not quite, quite banks. So non-banks or non-banking financial, uh, intermediaries, NBFIs. Um, and Americans call those sorts of institutions shadow banks. Uh, central banks, um, are, are quite distinctive banks. Most, uh, central banks, although not all of them, are owned by governments, uh, by, by central governments, by national governments. There are a couple of, Uh, uh, central banks that are privately owned, the South African Reserve Bank, I think it's one, the nat the, uh, Swiss National Bank is another one. But generally they're, they're, they're owned by the government. Um, they don't engage in commercial, um, activities. In other words, we, we can't do our banking, uh, with, uh, uh, with the reserve Bank. Um, they, they, they're the banker, they're the government's banker. and banker to government departments, government agencies. Uh, the world's, uh, major central banks include the US Federal Reserve system, um, more generally known as the Fed. The European Central Bank, which is the central bank for the member countries of the European Union. Uh, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the People's Bank of China, which is, uh, China's uh central bank. Uh, the Reserve Bank of India, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, uh, the Bank of Canada, um, the, the, the, among the central banks, uh, of the world. Australia's central bank um is the Reserve Bank of Australia, the RBA, the Reserve Bank of Australia, but before 1960, uh, our central bank was the Commonwealth Bank, which was both a government owned commercial bank and, um, a central bank, uh, but the two components of the Commonwealth Bank, the central bank, uh, component and the commercial banking component. Uh, were separated by an Act of Parliament in 1959, and the central banking functions went to the Reserve Bank and the commercial banking functions of the Commonwealth Bank stayed with the Commonwealth Bank, or Commonwealth Banking Corporation, as it was called in. Uh, central banks, um, have, um, several administrative, uh, responsibilities and several, um, policy, um, Um, uh, responsibilities, uh, although, uh, not all central banks have exactly the same responsibilities, uh. Uh, but generally, uh, they're the government's banker, uh, which involves conducting banking business for the government and government agencies. Uh, generally they're responsible for producing and issuing currency notes. Uh, they hold the nation's foreign exchange reserves. And they're generally responsible for the payment system, uh, which involves the clearing and settlement of checks, credit cards, foreign exchange balances. Now as well as those administrative responsibilities, uh, there are 3 very important policy responsibilities performed by most, but again not by all central banks. The first policy responsibility and the most important one is conducting monetary policy. Uh, they, uh, generally, but, uh, not all of them, uh, oversee the prudential supervision of banks, uh, which means that, uh, they, um, they, they check regularly on what the banks are up to, making sure that they're not, uh, taking on, uh, risky, um, activities. Now the Reserve Bank had that responsibility up to 1998. In 1998, a new organisation called the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA was created, and it was given the responsibility of supervising the individual banks. And central banks also generally have the responsibility of maintaining the stability of the financial system. Including the stability of the, the payment system. So, uh, uh, putting these three policy functions, conducting monetary policy, um, undertaking the prudential supervision of the banks, uh, and, uh, maintaining the stability of the financial system, putting those three responsibilities together, central banks are very significant uh economic institutions, and important advisors to governments. Uh, so far as the emergence of central banks are concerned, the, the, um, um, uh, early central banks were located in Europe, uh, of the central banks operating today. The longest established central bank is the is the Swedish Riksbank. Which was established in 1668. The Bank of England was established in 1694. Uh, and, uh, it's often regarded as the model upon which modern central banks, um, are, are based. Now, although, uh, many central banks have been operating for more than 100 years, they, they're not static, um, institutions, so far as the functions and operations are concerned, uh, rather they're dynamic, uh, institutions, although dynamic in an evolutionary sense, uh, not in a revolutionary sense. There's nothing very revolutionary about, um, about central banks, but the, the, uh, point that I want to stress is that, Take the Bank of England, for example, established in 1694. Over 300 years ago, but what it does today, uh was um nothing like what it was doing back in the um in the 1690s. Um, central banks evolve, uh, with changing conditions, changing circumstances. Uh, so far as the history of central banking in Australia is concerned, um, one can't be too precise about when central banking commenced, um, in Australia, and this is because of the evolutionary, uh, process of, um, central banking. Uh, it didn't suddenly happen as a result, say, of, of an act of parliament. Uh, but there were a number of developments, uh, that were, were of some significance. First of all, the depression in Australia, in eastern Australia, I emphasise as a Western Australian, um, in eastern Australia, in, in, in Melbourne and Sydney in the 1890s, uh, in the, yes, in the 1890s, uh, that depression was a very severe depression. Uh, in many ways worse than the depression of the 1930s, um, in Australia. Uh, over half the banks operating in eastern Australia, um, uh, ceased functioning, um, suspended payments, um, some of them reconstructed and came back into operation, but some of them, uh, never, uh, never recovered. Um, and, uh, as a result of that experience, um, they started to, uh, develop an idea that perhaps, um, that there should be, uh, um, government banks, and we're talking about pre-Federation here, the separate colonies, that they should each of the colonies should have a government bank that would guarantee, uh, the, um, Uh, the security of people's, um, deposits. Uh, there was a bit of talk about, um, a central bank or central banks too, um, but the main discussion was really about a a government owned commercial bank that would compete against the private banks and provide greater security. Uh, for people's, um, people's deposits. So that began really, um, a, a, a concerted discussion that that went on, um, after, after Federation. Uh, the Australian Constitution, uh, which, um, came into operation on the 1st of January, 1901, uh, was of some significance too, because, um, one of the, one of the clauses in the in in the constitution gave the Federal parliament and hence the federal government responsibility uh for banks, but banks that operated beyond a single state. Um, banks that were operating only in a particular state, uh, came under uh state, um, jurisdiction. Um, and that also led post federation to discussions by federal politicians and by the by the federal parliament about the possibility of a government, a government bank. And in fact, um, after Federation, uh, there was quite a debate among the federal parliamentarians, the labour Party, for example, um, there were two views, uh, one, supported by um King O'Malley, who was a Tasmanian. A member of the House of Representatives, uh, he advocated a composite government owned commercial bank and central bank in the one institution. Um, uh. Um, Andrew Fisher, um, and, uh, William Morris Hughes, uh, wanted, um, a government owned commercial bank, not, uh, not at least initially, uh, with central banking functions. On the non-Labor side, the, the major uh non-Labor grouping in the Federal parliament uh led by Alfred Deakin and uh and Sir John Forrest, uh, advocated a privately owned, Uh, central bank, um, a bit like the Bank of England, and in fact, uh, both, uh, uh, Deacon and uh King and um, Uh, forest, separately, uh, went to London and talked to people in the Bank of England and in the British Treasury about the possibility of, uh, of a, um, Uh, a central bank being created, but a privately owned, owned one. Well, the, the issue was decided. Uh, for a while, um, in 1911 when the Commonwealth Bank was established, uh, Fisher was Prime Minister and Treasurer, he introduced the legislation, uh, and, uh, when the Commonwealth Bank was created in 1911, uh, it, uh, it's only central banking function uh was banker uh to the federal government. Uh, uh, Fisher sort of indicated that maybe over time it might take on some central banking functions, but basically, um, the, uh, Fisher, uh, Hughes idea, um, of a government owned, uh, commercial bank, uh, to compete against the private banks and to provide a deposit guarantee, uh, 11 the day. But. Slowly, gradually over the next 3 decades, or 4 decades, uh, the Commonwealth Bank evolved into the sort of bank. That O'Malley had floated, namely a composite government owned commercial bank and central bank, uh in, in the one institution. Um, looking at the history, um, of, um, central banking, um, I, I think it's useful perhaps to, um, divide all the bits and pieces of information, uh, into, um, two, streams. One is the institutional development of a central bank in Australia, and the other one is the development of the the policy conducted. Uh, by, uh, by the central bank, uh, the policy objectives, the instruments that we used, uh, to, um, achieve policy objectives. So, um, I'm, I'm gonna look at those two streams of. Uh, information or ideas, um. Um, Beginning with the institutional side, I've already talked a bit about the um institutional development, uh, the legislation in 1911, creating the, um, the Commonwealth Bank, uh, and the fact that it's only central banking function really was uh uh banker to the Commonwealth government. But during the First World War, um, the Commonwealth Bank took on the responsibility of floating loans, uh, for the federal government, loans that were needed to finance the, the war effort, and that is commonly uh uh uh not perhaps not so much today, but for many decades, a common characteristic of central banks. Um, in 1920, the Commonwealth Bank was given responsibility for printing and issuing of currency notes. When an Australian currency was established by an Act of Parliament in 1910. The responsibility was given to the Treasury, but in 1920 it was transferred from the Treasury uh to the Commonwealth Bank. In 1924, uh, the responsibility uh for, um, Uh Um, uh, settling, um. Uh, banks, uh, into bank balances, um, was given to the Commonwealth Bank. Um, in other words, uh, the banks, uh, uh, when when checks were drawn, some banks owed other banks money because of the different, um, um, different check holders and so on. And so, uh, the imbalances between the banks had to be settled. And from 1924, that settlement had to be undertaken through the Commonwealth Bank, which meant that the banks had to establish uh um balances, uh deposits at the Commonwealth Bank. During the depression of the 30s, uh the Commonwealth Bank took responsibility for uh the exchange rate, uh, and began to exert uh an increasing influence over interest rates. And during the Second World War, uh, a number of, uh, what were called direct controls were given to the Commonwealth Bank. For example, uh, from the Second World War, the Commonwealth Bank, um, could, um, determine bank interest rates. Uh, could, uh, uh, determine how much the banks could lend in a particular period. Uh, and also, uh, the banks, uh, had to hand over to the Commonwealth Bank a certain proportion of their deposits. Uh, these were called special deposits and were used for monetary policy purposes, as I'll explain in a moment. Um, so, uh, this is how the Commonwealth Bank, um, evolved, uh, over the, uh, uh, 30 years or so after 1911, taking on more and more responsibilities, uh, as, as a central bank. Um, And, uh, in 1959, uh, legislation, as I mentioned, was passed to separate the two component parts of the Commonwealth Bank with the Reserve Bank, uh, being created as a separate stand-alone, uh, central bank and the, um, commercial banking functions of the Commonwealth Bank remaining, uh, with the Commonwealth, uh, Commonwealth Bank. Um, Now moving on to um the um other um um stream of uh of uh uh developments of the policy, the policy side, uh, which, um, for me is a more, more interesting, um, um, side, um. When um when the Commonwealth Bank was starting to uh develop, The idea that it should be functioning as a, as a central bank, uh this is the 1920s. Um, It Sought advice from the Bank of England as to how, It could conduct monetary policy, I perhaps I should preface that, I'll come back to that in a minute, but, uh, the, as I said earlier, the main function of central banks is to conduct monetary policy. And what this means in particular is uh the um ensuring that uh inflation remains at, Relatively low and stable levels. Um, also, uh, monetary policy involves, um, maintaining, uh, high levels of employment, uh, even full employment. Um, and, uh, maybe, um, uh, ensuring that, uh, living standards, uh, continue to increase. Um, in 1945, the 1945 Commonwealth Bank Act, uh, gave the Commonwealth Bank a charter. And there were, there were 3, and when the Reserve Bank was created, that charter moved across to the Reserve Bank, and the charter says that the, uh, the, the, the bank, uh, has a responsibility for, um, preserving the value of the currency, i.e., keeping inflation, uh, down to, uh, relatively low levels, uh, maintaining full employment. And uh ensuring that living standards um increase over, over time, but of those three elements, usually the, the inflation one is the major one when you talk about um central banks and um monetary policy. Coming back to the 1920s, uh, the, um, uh, the Commonwealth Bank sought advice from the, uh, the Bank of England. In fact, they invited the governor of the Bank of England to come to Australia to tell the Commonwealth Bank how to conduct monetary policy. Um, he was unable to come, but he sent one of his very senior members. Uh, who, uh, when he was asked, or Ernest Harvey, when he was asked, you know, how, by the Commonwealth Bank people, how can we conduct monetary policy, uh, Harvey said, I will do what the, um, uh, do what the Bank of England does, um, use, use the short-term money market, uh, to buy and sell government securities, and in that way you can control, uh, the rate of inflation and so on. And he was very quickly told, well, Australia doesn't have a short-term money market and uh Harvey then said, well, you'll have to um you'll have to think of uh some other way of uh of um conducting monetary policy. Um, I said a moment ago that during the Second World War, the Commonwealth Bank was given, uh, some responsibilities, uh, one, to, to, Uh, responsibility over bank interest rates, um, over bank lending, uh, and it had to hand over a certain proportion of its, um, deposits, uh, to the Commonwealth Bank. So what the Commonwealth Bank did was to use those controls to conduct monetary policy. In other words, if if uh inflation was accelerating. The Commonwealth Bank, ordered the banks to lift their interest rates in order to cut back economic activity in order to slow down the rate of increase in prices. Um, the Commonwealth Bank also ordered the banks to cut back their lending for the same purpose. And vice versa, if unemployment was increasing, prices were fairly low and falling, then the reversed, um, banks were told to lift to reduce their interest rates to expand their, their, their, their lending. Now this worked for a while. Um, but increasingly, uh, these controls, uh, lost, uh, their potency. Uh, and the reason why was that the, the Australian Constitution, I said had has a clause about um um uh regulating banks. Or or giving the Commonwealth responsibility for banks. Not non-banks. So those controls were put on the banks, restricting their activity in times of increasing prices and so on. Um, the non-banks were not controlled, and so people who wanted to borrow money and so on were being knocked back, uh, by the banks, and this gave an opportunity for building societies, credit unions, finance companies to expand. And um by the 60s and well into the 70s, the area of control of the financial system. Uh, uh, by the, uh, Reserve Bank was diminishing its ability to influence the financial system, uh, was diminishing because it only had control of the banks. Um, and so, um, Uh, it had to um devise an alternative system. Fortunately, by the, uh, by that time, by, by the late 60s into the 70s, a short-term money market had developed um in, in Australia. Uh, and so, um, the, uh, mechanism for, uh, conducting monetary policy through what is called market operations, uh, provided an increasing opportunity, uh, for the, um, for the Reserve Bank. Um, and, uh. At the same time, the banks were uh putting pressure on the government to deregulate the banking system. Uh, which, uh, would give the banks, uh, freedom. To set their interest rates uh as um that they saw, they saw fit. Um, Uh, so, uh, more flexible interest rates, uh, and the fact that interest rates covered the whole financial system, whereas the direct controls only involved the banks, but now using interest rates, particularly the short-term interest rates to conduct monetary policy. The Reserve Bank was able to influence the financial system as a whole, not just banks, but building societies, credit unions, and so on. Um, so, uh, this was, this was a, uh, a marked departure, a marked turning point in the way, uh, monetary policy, uh, was, um, uh, was henceforth, um, conducted. More specifically, uh, what the Reserve Bank did, uh, was to focus on the very short end of, um, of the, um, market, uh, which was the overnight rate of interest charged by banks to each other, uh, when they wanted to lend to each other overnight, it's a very short period. Um, and that interest rate, that very short interest rate, uh, is, is known as the cash rate, uh, and the Reserve Bank targets now targets the cash rate, the overnight, um, rate. Um, charged by banks to each other on loans. The cash rate is important for a number of reasons, but one is that it influences other interest rates, longer term interest rates. It's a very powerful instrument. So if the Reserve Bank wants to, um, tighten monetary policy in order to try and reduce the rate of inflation. It will increase the cash rate and vice versa if it wants to loosen monetary policy, it will ease or reduce the cash rate, and it does those things through buying and selling uh uh securities on the open market. OK, if it wants to uh tighten the cash um cash cash rate, it will, um, it will sell securities. Uh, and what that does is pull money out of, out of the economy. Uh, people, businesses have less money to spend, uh, which has a downward impact on prices and employment and so on, and vice versa if it wants to, um, uh, um boost economic activity because the prices are dropping and unemployment is increasing. Um, then it will buy government securities on the open market, and that buy securities from people, companies, and so on, uh, people, companies have now have more money they spend, and that that boosts economic activity, prices, employment, and so on. So, um, that's the, um, that's the essence. So we moved from using direct controls, uh, which were Um, becoming, uh, less, um, uh, powerful. Uh, because, uh, the controls didn't cover the non-banks, and they expanded markedly, so the central bank had less area of control to what is called technically open market operations whereby the central bank buys and sells securities in order to influence. Uh, short-term interest rates, um, in order to either boost activity or um cut back, um, activity. Um, now, as well as, um, Changing the method of conducting monetary policy from direct controls to open market operations. Um, another thing that happened, and this happened in the very early 1990s, uh, was that the Reserve Bank had to decide. Um, what it's main target. What it's uh target objective uh was going to be, uh, New Zealand in 1990 had introduced uh uh inflation targeting. Uh, it said, OK, we're going to, our policy is to achieve an inflation rate of, uh, uh, ecstasy, I forget exactly what it was. Um, some other European countries were starting to do that. In 1992, the Reserve Bank, uh, decided that it was going to have an inflation target of 2 to 3%. And so, Um, when it was conducting um market operations, its aim was to ensure that inflation, uh, Uh, I, I, on average, uh, over the medium term, uh, would be, uh, in the 2 to 3% range and preferably right in the middle, um, of that, um, of, of that range. Uh, how successful have these changes, uh, been? Well, in the 1970s and 1980s, uh, inflation, got up to, uh, nearly 20%, uh, on, on occasion. The average was over 10%. Uh there were uh at least 5 recessions in Australia, uh through the 70s and, and 80s. Uh, if you then look at the period from the early 90s, uh, to the COVID pandemic in the early 2020s, uh, if you look at that 30 year period. The average rate of inflation in Australia has has been 2.6%, almost. In the, in the centre of the target range. Recessions, none, not one in that 30 year period. Um, And Uh, you know, to some degree, the Reserve Bank has been, um. commended, congratulated for the way that it operated, uh, monetary policy, um, over, over that period, um. Uh, even during the global financial crisis in 2007, 2009, um, Australia. Uh, had only one quarter of negative growth. Um, economists, when they talk about recessions, tend to define a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative growth of GDP. Um, some people are starting to talk about, um, per capita GDP, but, um, that's not the right way to go. It's two consecutive quarters of negative growth, and, uh, uh, from, um. Uh, from, uh, 1991 with the recovery of the early 90s recession, uh, to, to COVID, um, Australia, uh, did not experience two consecutive quarters of negative growth. I think there were only two, rather small European countries that were in the same, uh, same category, didn't, didn't experience, uh, over that, that period, two quarters of negative growth. I think Austria was one I'm not sure uh what the other one was. Um, So, uh, so there's been, uh, quite a, a transformation and, um, um, a lot of it is due to that change in the way it can, the Reserve Bank conducted monetary policy, um, and the installation of, uh, an inflation, um, target. Uh, so that's, that's, that's, that's the mon monetary side. Uh, what about the financial stability side, the other objective, uh, that the Reserve Bank, uh, has. Now this has to do with ensuring that there is no systemic collapse of financial institutions which might lead to depositors losing their money and possibly causing the economy to sink into a recession or a depression. Panic, uh, leading to depositors withdrawing their money from a particular bank can lead to contagion. As depositors in other banks worry about the safety of their deposits and begin to withdraw their deposits, as happened for example in Australia in the 1890s when people rushed to the banks to pull their money out and that had a a very negative effect on the stability of the banking system and also. Um, during the global financial crisis, uh, there, there were pictures, uh, day after day of people queuing outside banks, uh, in, in the United States, in Britain, and in, in other, in other countries, Greece, for example. Financial uh instability in this way, panic, people uh wanting to get their money out of the banks before the banks collapsed. Can affect economic activity and employment. The uncertainty caused by that leads to cutbacks in economic activity, unemployment, and there's there can be a um a snowballing of uh of uh circumstances that lead eventually to a recession and maybe a, a depression. Uh, it's important to understand here that, um, whereas, um, people can, Withdraw their money. Uh, reasonably easily because, um, uh, the, the, the, the money is in, uh, short-term deposits, uh, maybe at call or uh for periods of say 3 to 6 months. Um, banks, however, uh, find it difficult to withdraw money that they have invested. In other words, the liabilities of banks, namely deposits, can be withdrawn quickly, but banks' assets, their investments in housing and so on. Uh, uh, are more difficult to, to withdraw and so in the meantime, banks can suffer from liquidity crises. Uh, they might still be solvent, uh, in the sense that their investments are in, um, good, uh, uh, uh, and, and, uh, fairly stable, uh, uh, activities. Um, but Short-term bursts of panic, leading to um invest in uh depositors uh withdrawing their money from banks uh can uh lead uh to uh liquidity crises. And it's here that central banks uh play, can play and do play an important role in acting as lenders of last resort to the banking system. Providing uh short-term loans to overcome, short-term panic on the part of bank, uh bank depositors, and that's a very important, um function too, again, uh, talking about the global financial crisis. Of 20072009, again, um, central banks around the world, the Bank of England, for example, uh, the, the Fed, um, uh, lent banks money to tide them over until things settled down and people were coming back to the banks and depositing, uh, their, their savings. Now, uh, it's it's, it's important to, um, to understand that, um, That, uh, central banks would only lend to solvent banks. Uh, they, they don't lend to banks that have already, uh, or on the verge of becoming bankrupt or, or even bankrupt. Banks are going to be, uh, in, in a, or should be in a, in a solvent, um, position that, that was weakened a bit during the global financial crisis. Uh, it's important to understand that, uh, the Reserve Bank, for example, doesn't guarantee depositors, um, doesn't guarantee deposits, bank deposits. Uh, the Banking Act refers to the Reserve Bank having a responsibility to protect. Depositors' money. It doesn't say that the Reserve Bank will guarantee bank deposits during the global financial crisis, the government, and not the Reserve Bank, announced that it would guarantee deposits lodged in deposit accepting institutions up to a limit of $1 million as. Uh, things settled down, uh, that, that amount was cut, cut back to 250,000. Uh, but some sometimes people think that, um, the Reserve Bank has a responsibility to guarantee people's deposits. Um, it, it doesn't, uh, the, um, it, it attempts to, uh, protect people's deposits. Um, and more particularly APRA, is the key institution there in checking people's banks' books on a regular basis to ensure that people's deposits are safe, that the banks are not indulging in risky type business. Uh So far as um the um Uh, stability of the Australian banking system is concerned since the collapses in the 1890s, there hasn't been anything like that since, um, during the depression of the 1930s, um, only three, pretty small banks, um, uh, uh, went to the wall, and only in the case of one of those banks did people um lose some of their money, uh, but, uh, less than 2% of deposits, um, were lost. In 1979, the smallest of the major trading banks in Australia, the Bank of Adelaide, was forced to merge with the ANZ Banking Group when it experienced difficulties with the assistance of the Reserve Bank, the ANZ took over the, Um, Bank of Adelaide and again, um, what might have been a bank collapse and the loss of people's deposits was overcome again, in part due to actions by the by the central bank, by the reserve Bank. Two state banks in the early 1990s, the State Savings Bank of South Australia and the Savings Bank of Victoria, also faced possible collapse, but in each of those cases, the deposits lodged with the banks were fully backed by the state governments that owned the banks and consequently depositors were paid their money in full. Well, just summing, just summing up this very quickly because you might have some questions, um, what I've, uh, what I've emphasised is that, uh, the Commonwealth Bank and then the Reserve Bank, uh, as Australia's central bank was initially unable to exert a major influence over economic policy, mainly because it lacked the policy tools or instruments to conduct monetary policy successfully.
