SPEAKER 1
OK, I'll get a start, um, and I'll begin by acknowledging, uh, the traditional owners, the Nunnaw and Namburi, and pay my respects to elders, uh, people and country. Um, just a couple of admin things. Now, next Monday, uh, for those who wish to, uh, participate, there is a visit to the Noel Butlin Archives centre. It's in detailed in your class outline. Uh, so it's, uh, Monday 10 a.m., probably go from about 10 to 11:30 a.m. Uh, we would meet just at the front of the Menzies library. Do people know the Menzies Library at the other side of campus, so sort of opposite the Coombs building over, Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it easily enough. Uh, I think it's might even be building one on campus, I think from memory. Um, anyway, it's in, uh, building 2, Menzies Library is building 2, so 10 to 11:30, the Noel Butlin Archives Centre is, uh, really Australia's largest, Archive, um, of economic history really, business and labour, um, as well as being the university archive, it's been going since the 1950s, uh, and you know, it, it's a really good opportunity to get a sense of the resources available on campus for your own, uh, Work, your own essay writing, um, often neglected because, uh, you know, it's, uh, well it's partly online, but, you know, we're talking about original documents, original archives, um. And, uh, it's also a way of, of, I, I guess, deepening your knowledge of how economic history is researched and written, because these are the kinds of resources, the kinds of sources that economic historians have used to write the history of Australia. So, um, really good opportunities. Uh, Sarah over there will, uh, take us through some examples of sources that they have. So I'd really recommend that. It's best 90 minutes you'll spend that week probably. Um, and, uh, I'll meet you all there at 10 o'clock on Monday. I'll put a notice up also just a reminder notice on Wattle, uh, this week, but the detail that you need is there in the course schedule within the class outline. Are there any other um queries that we need to tutorials obviously begin this week, any administrative issues that need to be dealt with, everyone's happy. OK, well, let's get to start on today's lecture then, which I've called economic foundations of colonisation, so I'm dealing with the very early history here of um, Primarily New South Wales. OK, so here we're we're obviously mobile is your sort of where I'm gonna take you, um, the origins of the colonisation of Australia, why it happens, and the economic dimensions of that. A sense of the convicts, and some of you, most of you perhaps many of you will have done some aspect of convict history, I imagine at school or whatever. Uh, what I want to focus on here particularly is the economic dimensions of convict societies, so thinking about convicts as workers, for instance, connecting convict, uh, labour to economic development, uh, and economic growth in early Australia, pardon me. Thirdly, um, some an overview of the early colonial economy in its various aspects, uh, currency, trade, and so on, um, again, very much an overview. I'll talk briefly about the Rum Rebellion as an episode in early Australian colonial history involving the overthrow of the government, it's replacement by, A short-lived military government, believe it or not, a military regime, yes, we've had a coup in Australian history, uh, and, and again exploring that in its economic aspects, and then finally just an overview of the Macquarie era, which is roughly 1810 to 1821, so that'll take us up to, The next lecture which will will look at the development, especially of uh the pastoral industry and uh the export economy of the 1820s and beyond. So, let me take you and, and please don't hesitate to uh ask a question along the way if you have any queries. So, I'm gonna begin with what's been called the Botany Bay debate, it's, I guess one of the most enduring, Uh, durable debates in Australian history, and it turns on, obviously the pretty important issue of the, the, the colonial foundations of Australia. Why does it happen? OK, so why do we end up with this rather strange colony on what to contemporaries in Britain and Europe must have seen the very end of the world in 1788. Now, there's a fairly intuitive uh explanation for it and a a a pretty conventional one which I'm sure uh probably all of you are familiar with and, Uh, the answer is it was to get rid of convicts. It was, you know, um, the basic idea is that Britain had too many convicts, there'd been a proliferation of property offences, particularly in, uh, uh, 18th, uh, and 19th century, early 19th century Britain, so the. 100s, the early 1800s. This was the period of the industrial revolution. It was a period of rapid, uh, growth, the movement of, uh, people from country to the city, of great social dislocation, often of considerable economic deprivation, and, uh, uh, the authorities respond by proliferating the number of property offences as a way of protecting property from. The lower orders, the working classes, uh, many of those property offences, uh, Some of them, I should say, carried capital punishment, but that that was very commonly commuted to transportation, OK, to, to con to to a period of what was effectively a kind of banishment. Now um the North American uh colonies, British North America, had been a site for the transportation of convicts for, for, for many years before Australia was founded, um. The the arrangement of that was rather different to what would eventually occur in Australia. The role of private contractors was uh very prominent. The, the, um, services, if you like, of convicts was effectively sold to. To landowners and others in uh North America, so it's a quite a different system in which the state played a, I think a less prominent role, and I think if you can, if you're looking for differences, enduring differences between the United States and Australia. Uh, in terms of the way that, uh, you know, the, the role of the state is understood, there's an interesting moment of comparison, the ways in which convict transportation worked in relation to those two different places. The state has a much more central role. It's a much more bureaucratic government directed effort in the case of transportation, convict transportation to Australia. But there, there are the elements of the, the convict dumping theory, um. 1770, James Cook claimed part, not all but part, large part of the east coast of Australia for the United Kingdom, for Britain. In the 1780s, um, Britain's convict problem becomes increasingly overwhelming, and of course the background there is the American War of Independence, the American Revolution, which of course means that convicts can no longer be sent, uh, there, and so there is a search for alternatives, um, uh, you can see, uh, yes, so 171775 to about 1783 War of Independence, Bri Britain's convict problems becoming, uh, um, Well, even more pressing, they're using um hulks, basically ships, uh, placed in in harbours to, to effectively store um prisoners because of the, the lack of alternatives. Remember this is before the building of penitentiaries, the modern jail, uh, did not exist in the period we're talking about here. Imprisonment was usually only short-term for things like debt. OK, um, uh, jails were not used for that purpose, uh, transportation or indeed execution, uh, were the more likely alternatives. So the modern penitentiary wasn't, hadn't yet emerged in this period as an alternative to transportation. Uh, through a complex process, by 1786, there is a decision in favour of Botany Bay. They rely heavily on reports of, of, of Cook's, uh, 1770 voyage as you'd expect, it's one of their primary sources of information. Uh, Joseph Banks, the botanist on that voyage, was a great advocate of the possibilities of, of, um, a settlement in New South Wales. Uh, the first fleet sailed in 1787, and as I'm sure you're aware, it arrives in, uh, New South Wales in January 1788. Uh, they, of course, don't settle in Botany Bay, um, but rather in Port Jackson, in what is now current day Sydney, um, or Sydney harbour. So that that's the convict dumping theory, very simple, um, Great Britain has too many convicts, it has nowhere to put them. Uh, there's a kind of exploration of alternatives such as in South West Africa. These proved to be, uh, unfeasible, uh, and Botany Bay or New South Wales emerges as a kind of last resort at the other end of the world. It's helpful that it's a long way away, which means that this will be a genuine banishment. It's not gonna be easy for convicts to return, that was exactly the intention. Um, it's, it's a pretty straightforward explanation. Um, now I'll skip over that briefly. Um, and also a very problematic one, for a whole range of reasons, and here's one of them. Why a place so far from Britain? OK, was, was it sufficient that it was far away and therefore, you know, a good place to, to send convicts so they couldn't come back? Well, that had to be balanced against the fact that it was so expensive and risky. I mean this was a hugely risky venture. 11 ships, a voyage of what, about 8 or 9 months, um. Uh, very expensive, uh, the possibility of, of, uh, large numbers dying from disease, whether on the ship itself or when they arrived, the possibility of famine when they arrived, um, there've been all sorts of disasters in the past, uh, you know, in places actually, you know, nowhere near this distance from Britain. Um, so why, why New South Wales, why somewhere so, so far away, why such a risky, expensive venture? So that's basically the point at which historians began questioning the, the, the convict dumping theory. And you won't be surprised to hear they do come up with economic incentives and motives as a part of the the the case for understanding why such a venture was initiated. This sort of began in the 1950s, really, I mean there had been some earlier questioning of the convict dumping theory, but, I mean those I'll call here revisionists and so a pretty um, Uh, it's a bit of a catch-all because, you know, um, it, it encompasses a range of different sorts of arguments that have been going on now for a very, very long time. One of the earliest was a geographer, um, from Tasmania called KM Dallas in Dallas, and, Without citing a vast amount of evidence at this stage, although he did more research later on, he suggested there were a number of economic incentives at play, that we needed to understand this decision in the context of emerging patterns of world trade in in the 1700s, and here were four of the, the, the areas on which Dallas focused. He said that, A, um, a convict settlement in Sydney would promote trade with China, OK, that it would be helpful in promoting, and you could see how that would work. You'd send convict and in fact sort of what did happen, you'd send convicts to, to Sydney or to New South Wales, and you'd have an empty ship, right? Now, if that empty ship went all the way back to, to, to Britain, that's a very expensive venture, a very expensive venture, OK, it's a bit like, Uh, except on a much grander scale, you know, the ways the airlines today don't like having empty or half empty planes. Instead they cancel our flights for us so that you go out to the airport and find you've got a 3 hour wait. I, this is sort of, um, the same. Principle, but, but on a larger scale. So what it basically means is that empty ships could leave New South Wales, go to go to China, they could be filled with tea, and that could be taken back to Britain. It makes the whole thing, a much more payable venture. Um, the fur trade, the development of the fur trade in in North America, um, similar kind of argument around that that. Um, the shipping that would come to, uh, uh, the, the Pacific could be deployed in that sort of way as well. Trade around, um, with South America, and finally whaling and sealing, um, that, uh, you know, there were, uh, ventures already underway, um, uh, for, you know, the whaling and sealing industry. It was, as I'll talk about a bit later, um, an industry in which, um, uh, America, the United States would soon become a very prominent indeed. Uh, and, uh, again, uh, a, a base in New South Wales would be a very handy thing in promoting whaling and sealing, uh, very lucrative. I mean, I'll talk more about why whaling, uh, in particular was very important, uh, in this period. It was, uh, an industry that yielded a number of products of great value at the time. So, Dallas's conclusion was the first fleet was a well planned naval expedition sent to seize and fortify a naval base. The convicts were what they had always been the servants of mercantilist interests. Now the, yeah. Uh, it was developing. Yeah, you were getting whaling in, in sort of the, the South Pacific by that stage. Yeah, absolutely, yeah. So, um, yeah, it's beginning, beginning to take off, yeah. So, um, the argument here is that there was nothing sort of, uh, accidental or well not certainly unusual, but, uh, Um, that it's kind of explicable in terms of rational, economic, and strategic objectives. Now, mercantilism, do people know what that term means? OK, so Donald Trump at the moment is, is often accused, not often, but sometimes accused of uh a mercantilist approach to trade, and what it is, it's about using trade as an instrument of your foreign, your security or foreign policy. OK, so instead of trade being considered purely in economic terms, you're, you're actually using trade in a way that is designed to advance your kind of national strategic or defence or foreign policy interests. OK. And that's the argument here that convicts were essentially being used as instruments of British foreign policy, OK, they were effectively, um, you know, going to be used to open up a um a base, effectively a base in New South Wales that could advance economic and strategic interests of. Of the British Empire in this part of the world, OK, now this fit into an emerging kind of argument in imperial scholarship at the time, which is particularly associated with the historian Vincent Harlow, and this is the idea that in this period of the later 18th century, the late 1700s, in the British Empire, there is a swing to the east. Now this has been questioned in all sorts of ways because, quite frankly, the most important colonies for the British Empire through much of this period were, Not really yet because remember it it it is sort of a part of an empire, but it's, it's, it's a company project India at this stage, it hasn't been absorbed, but the swing to the east uh uh thesis argues that India is becoming more important. OK. What's the most important one in this period? Uh, well, they're sort of in so I'm, I'm thinking after the loss of the American colonies. But you're in the right, you're in the right territory. OK, arguably the yeah. Yeah, OK, so arguably the Caribbean, um, incredibly, anyone who's read Jane Austen, who's read Jane Austen novels? Anyone read Jane Austen novels here? OK, I mean, think of Mansfield Park, for instance, OK? It's all about the fortune that has been made in in the Caribbean. The Caribbean is constantly cropping up in those. They are products of the late 18th and early 19th century. And the, the, you know, the, the depth of British economic interests in the slave economies of, uh, of, of the Caribbean, so they're immensely important and, and, you know, I think the argument today would be the whole swing to the east concept's a bit of a dud. Uh, you know, when you consider it in that sort of context, but it was an argument that was around in the 50s, and yes, it, it, it was, was an idea that increasingly Britain's preoccupations were with South Asia, with the Pacific, uh, in, in the aftermath of the loss of the American colony. So it was a theory that was around the 50s, it, um, fit the Dallas argument quite neatly. Um, so people like more or less understand what's going on there, economics, not, not just about dumping a problem. Um, Other, uh, um, revisionists who kind of took up aspects of this, so Geoffrey Blainey, uh, pretty well-known historian, wrote The Tyranny of Distance, a book in 1966, and he argued, largely in line with Dallas, uh, he, he, you know, cited Dallas with approval, and he said that Norfolk Island is actually critical to this whole venture. So people know Norfolk Island out there in the, in the Pacific. Because, um, it was known that Norfolk Island had certain types of products that would be critical uh for for supplying the Royal Navy, the British Navy, OK, and in particular, the pines would be useful in providing timber for masts. There was a flex, uh, for sails and ropes and hemp. That these could all be grown on Norfolk Island successfully and that they could be harvested and they would strengthen Britain's naval supplies, uh, at a time when some of the uh traditional suppliers, particularly on the continent, continental Europe, were becoming unavailable. OK, so this is a kind of extension of that argument that we can't simply see this in terms of dumping convicts, that economic and strategic, uh, uh, motivations, uh, were also very important. So, um, I, I cite that not because it's of critical importance in this course, but I mean I think it it it shows you that right from the outset, even if we're looking for explanations of why we end up with a British colony in eastern Australia in in New South Wales, Um, we, we need to take into consideration economic factors. There is a whole tradition of argument here among historians that focuses on what we now call the economy, on economic motivations, OK? I mean, my, I'm not an expert on this particular debate, but you know I think it's critical here to to to to um consider. How um convicts were understood within this period, because, you know, think back to the way they've been used as labour in North America under that earlier transportation system, they are seen as a resource. OK, they are seen as a resource, they are a form of forced labour, rather alongside that other more famous form of forced labour of this period. Which we just mentioned Slavery, right? So convicts, they're not slaves, they're not slaves, for a whole range of reasons, they're not slaves, but they are forced and coerced labour and like slaves, they're seen as a resource, an economic resource, a resource that can be put to work for empire. OK, so I think, I think, um, you know, that emphasis on strategic and economic issues is sound to the extent that it recognises that no one really saw convicts as just a problem to be gotten rid of. OK, convicts had long been seen as something that was potentially useful. OK, potentially useful in expanding and developing an empire, and this is sort of how it pans out in a way. This doesn't bear on the motivations for the first fleet. You can't read it backwards, you can't say, oh this is what happened after 1788, therefore this, you know, that tells us the the original motivations of policy makers, decision makers back in England. No, you can't do that, that's a very poor historical argument. But what is striking is that the way the colony develops, I think does reflect to a great extent that sense of convicts as not merely subject to punishment or not merely objects who needed to be punished because of their misdeeds, but as economic resources to be used for profit and for advancing the strategic interests of empire. So, Let's ask the famous question, what were, who were the convicts? What do we know about them? What do we know about them? So, 1788 to about 1868, um, very extended period. Uh, we often don't think of convict transportation as going that late, but it did to to Western Australia in that last 17 or 18 years. OK, so it's a, it's a long history. Um, 1788 to 1840 to New South Wales, um, and of course remember New South Wales in that period includes present day what we now know as Queensland, what we now know as Victoria, it was in the Port Phillip district. Queensland was usually known as Moreton Bay District. They were a part of New South Wales at that time. Uh, they didn't separate till the 1850s. Uh, Van Diemen's Land, Tasmania, takes convicts from 184 through to 1853, OK, and you know, a, a smaller population, you can see there just, you know, how, um, you know, why the convict heritage, the con the memory of the convict era remains so important even today in, in Tasmania. OK, I mean that's a, a period of about, about 50 years and you'll notice there that for about what, 13 years, uh, Uh, or any convicts arriving in Australia, not quite 13 years actually, about 12 years, um, any convicts arriving in Australia went to Tasmania, they went to Van Diemen's Land, so really important part of the history of what was then and now a pretty small place in terms of both area and population, certainly by Australian standards. As I mentioned, as I mentioned, there was a period of about 18 years where convicts were sent to Western Australia, and this really dramatises the notion of the convict, uh, as a labourer. Because that's what, that's why Western Australia wanted convicts, OK, from 1829 when the first, uh, colony, effectively a private company set up in Perth, Swan River, um, it had been bedevilled by the problem of labour. Where do you get the workers from? OK, Karl Marx in capital, yes, Karl Marx, famous study capital, ridiculed the Western Australian colonists directly, ridiculed them, he said they remembered everything. They remembered everything except the need for labour. OK, so even when you kind of recruited workers. They knew that they were in heavy demand because of the isolation of Western Australia, so you'd recruit free workers and they'd say, oh look, I might stick around if you give me a box of grog. OK, so it's expensive to deal with them and they demand more grog in the next week, or they'd just run away, or they'd demand more wages, or they'd misbehave, and there was never enough of them, so. Convict transportation to Western Australia is essentially to deal with that problem from the, you know, from the point of view of employers. It was all about labour. It was not getting coerced, unfree labour in to, to, uh, uh, you know, essentially supply a gap, make up for a gap that was there. So how many convicts all that? It's about 160,000 across all those years. Very important, this isn't an even process, they don't sort of, you know. Flow at an even rate across that period, there are periods of, uh, a real, a trickle, basically, almost no convicts, and there's other periods where significant numbers of convicts are coming into Australia, so, Broadly speaking, and this is very broad, 1788 to 1815, fairly small numbers, fairly small numbers. I mean, we, you know, this is the period I'm actually going to be talking about today. We're not talking about vast numbers in that early period, but many from 1815 to about 1835. And then, uh, uh, the, you know, it's sort of the, the, the flow isn't quite as great after that. Um, once convict transportation begins winding down to New South Wales and becomes, uh, essentially reliant for a time on Van Diemen's Land, Tasmania. So, can you account for 7, 1788 to 1815? Why do you think there were not terribly many in that early period? What do we know about that early period? Yes. Or freed, I mean they they they, many of them are freed, of course, you know, absolutely, yeah, uh the, the key factor though isn't our end, the Australian end, it's the supply end, what's happening at the other end, yeah. So 1812 is a part of the mix, but a very small part of the mix. What's the bigger part of the mix? Yeah, this is, this is the period of war with France, OK? Right through this. Remember, almost as soon as the first fleet arrives, the Bastille is stormed. Of course they don't get to know about it until what, 1790. So the second fleet. The Second Fleet brings news of the French Revolution, and then of course the revolutionary Wars. Britain is at war with France in the 1790s, and there's periods of peace and then Napoleonic wars, all the way through, more or less with uh a a a um a little break in there, uh, towards the end to 1815 and Waterloo. OK, so, um, this is a period of war, of disruption, uh, and, uh, you know, um, Basically, the, the supply of convicts during that wartime period is, um, it happens, there's certainly convict transportation, but, um, not, not quite the kind of flow that you get once, uh, the world returns to a more or less peaceful state after Waterloo in 1815. OK. So, um, 160,000, but not, not evenly spread across the period. Uh, the gender ratio, as you can see, now that's gonna cause a few issues, isn't it? 6 men to 11 woman was the ratio across the whole period. Um, I wonder what aspects of Australian culture derived from that particular statistic. This isn't really the course where we do that, I guess, but you know, male mateship maybe. Um, think of, um, I mean, the term that's been used for this by New Zealand historian Jamie Belich, James Belich is crew culture. A lot of economic activities in Australia then and even later, basically involve men, effectively formed into a kind of crew-like arrangement, like a ship. So you think of them, you know, things like, um, shearing, you know, on, on pastoral stations, um, whaling. Um, gold digging. Um, and even later, going right into the 20th century, think of something like the Snowy Mountain scheme. You know, even in that very, you know, much later period, you know, very, very male dominated workforces, OK, so cre crew culture has been an aspect of Australian economic history with obviously broader cultural dimensions too in terms of the way that men and women relate to one another, bonds of male mateship and all the rest of it. And it has a sexual dimension too, of course, that has been teased out by uh gay, you know, historians of of homosexuality, gay historians in Australia. Um, 3 quarters, theft without violence. OK, so they're not all, you know, poor old political prisoners who were, were sort of, you know, resisting British rule in Ireland, you know, the cliches. Um, no, most of them were thieves. Well, in fact, the best description I can come up with is they were thieves who got caught. OK, so they're basically ordinary working class, uh, men and women who got caught stealing stuff, is the best way of putting it, and. The stealing, you know, I know there's cliches, oh it was a loaf of bread and a handkerchief or something. It, it usually was a bit more substantial than that actually. Um, so, uh, they're essentially, these are property crimes, these are property crimes, um, and, uh, but tended to be theft without violence for the most part, uh, for over half it was their first recorded offence with an emphasis on the word recorded, OK? Thieves who got caught. So one of the interesting things about this is that especially from about the 1980s, economic historians really began looking at this stuff. And what they felt they found was a kind of ordinary cross section of the working class, OK, and that's a really important and interesting point because, You all know Oliver Twist, don't you? You've seen the old film from the 60s, or some of you might have read the Dickens novel. I mean, you know how the London criminality is presented in that story. How's it presented? Are they ordinary working class people in that, in that novel or in that musical or whatever? Some of you have probably acted in Oliver, have you? Who's been in Oliver here? Anyone? So, what are they? They're not presented as ordinary working class people, what are they presented as? Fein Dawkins What are they? Not ordinary working class, what are they? They're kind of professional thieves, aren't they? It all looks like highly organised if petty, professional thievery. They they're they're presented as a kind of uh professional a class of professional thieves. Um So, you know, this was the idea that that there's a kind of, and this is the traditional idea I'm talking about here, there's a kind of criminal subculture in London that's sort of just addicted to stealing stuff, to thievery. They make their living as as thieves, you know, um, if there was such a thing as, um, you know, uh, um, I don't know if they were filling out a form for universities occupation of a thief. OK, that that's the kind of argument that is, that, that, you know, uh, was, was very common up to about the 1980s for convicts, I was seen as a a class of professional thieves. Now, The economic history of the 1980s really overturned that idea, and they did it. Through a highly this is um, You know, the, the sort of cutting edge statistical work of the day. They discovered something that you could, you could, you could use personal computers for doing complex calculations, who knew, you know, so this is kind of pre- Excel spreadsheets and all the rest of it, but they went through vast numbers of what were called convict indents. OK, for about 1/3 of those transported to New South Wales. Between I think 1815 and about 1830, I think, or was it 1840 anyway, I can't remember the exact um period, but a concentrated period of convict transportation to New South Wales. And they looked at a third, so a large, a large sample of the convict indent was, which was the record that was made for each, um, each prisoner. It, it had all sorts of things, you know, the previous occupation, whether they had a mole at the bottom of their nose, whether they had a tattoo, to describe the tattoo. So quite like, like a pre-photographic passport. And using those, there had been earlier work on that, right going right back to the 1950s, Manning Clark did some work on those sorts of sources, and a, a young graduate student here in the 1960s called Lloyd Robson, um, used very primitive computing, um, uh, methods to do a 1 in 20 sample across the whole period of convict transportation, um. Can't remember if it included WA but anyway, 1 in 20 was his, his thing, that was the groundbreaking study. But this one was different. I mean, Robson back in the 60s using um that 1 in 20 sample stuck to the professional thieves argument. These were basically just professional crooks. Um, Stephen Nicholas and his colleagues in this convict workers' collection came up for very different set of conclusions on the basis of their study. They said, here is a cross section of the working class, but it's biassed in certain ways, they said. It, it's biassed in certain ways that were really good for economic growth and development in a new country. This is what they said. Firstly, overwhelmingly male, overwhelmingly male. Now if you have, um, houses to build, scrub to clear, um, uh, crops to plant, and all the rest of it, an overwhelmingly male workforce can be very advantageous. Now it's gonna cause problems in the end because obviously it's a barrier to household formation. To reproduction of the workforce, but some of the you know, the kind of hard work of uh development in a, a colony such as this one to have an overwhelmingly male workforce without dependent, they have no dependent for the most part, so they're, they're often, you know, single men, young single men. That reduces the cost to employers, so an employer only had to, um, uh, you know, they, um, paying someone, so if you're talking about an ex-convict or perhaps a, a free migrant, but you know, they, they basically the cost of maintaining, um, these, uh, people were reduced. OK, if you only had to maintain a single convict male as distinct from a man who had a wife and perhaps 3 children. Uh, it reduced your costs, so there are a whole range of reasons why an overwhelmingly male workforce is probably good for initial developments at least. It's young, so it's, it's often quite vigorous. OK, so in that sense it's not a cross section, they didn't, they weren't transporting lots and lots of elderly people. OK, they tended to transport younger men, often younger single men. OK, but certainly younger men, and again, very good for economic development. They tended also to, to have, as far as they could calculate higher levels of literacy than what was known about the working class in general. And again, this may well be related to the youth, the relative youth of the, uh, the, the convict workforce, OK, because younger people in Britain in the early part of the 19th century, for instance, were more likely to, to be literate, at least, uh, up to a point. There are different kinds of literacy, some people can read and write, some people can only read, they can't write. So, you know, what you count as literate is debatable, but anyway, they found, A higher than average degree of literacy, um, they thought that there was a very good, uh, range of skills represented among the convicts, and they basically made the argument, I put the question mark there, but they actually made the argument. They were in as far as the economy goes, these were good migrants, these were good migrants. OK. Now, um, were there drawbacks to all this? Well, I've already hinted at one, there are problems obviously around having an overwhelmingly male workforce in terms of, of, uh, household economies and household formation. Um, one issue that comes up is labour market efficiency. This is a kind of command economy, so basically, uh, a convict would declare what they did in their previous life. I was a whatever, and the authorities would judge on the basis of that, um, you know, what kind of work they would put you to. So if you, that you, you know, you'd been convicted of forgery and you were, you'd sort of been in kind of clerical work. Before, um, there, you know, you might be set up as a clerk because you had, you know, obviously a degree of literacy that would allow you to write letters, for instance, you know, within a business or for the even possibly for the governor or for officials. So, um, there, there was a kind of allocation of labour on, on the basis of a range of considerations, but that's certainly one of them. Um, but the argument goes here. Well, is that an efficient way of allocating labour? Because in a free market, people tend to, or freer market, people will tend to, to gravitate, won't they? I mean, you know, people make their own choices about, you know, which particular occupations they'll put their hand up for within reason, of course, within the limits of labour, demand and supply, but it's different from a command economy where you've got authorities allocating labour. Um, important also to consider here, there isn't an absolute distinction. Between, um, uh, the, the, the effectively free labour of convicts, that is, you know, the coerced labour of of a convict, and, um, the, and, and, and working for a wage because a system was developed, particularly in the early years, as soon as convicts had done what was considered their day's work, and sometimes that was calculated in hours, sometimes calculated in tasks, that was it. OK, and they could work on their own accounts, they could actually work for money for subsequent part of the day. OK, so, convicts were often earning wages for in the early period of of the colony because that there was a number of hours each week in which they could do that. And I guess the the final issue you might want to consider is the impact of coercion, of violence, and as I've already said, restrictions on family life. So it's not all a positive story, but there is a broad argument now coming out of that work in the 1980s, that highly statistical work, the convicts were probably a very good um collection of migrants for the development of economies. Let me move on, what and you'll talk about this in your chutes for this week, is how do you establish a kind of European economy, Effectively from kind of scratch in Australia. Now of course we know now it wasn't quite from scratch because we heard last week, didn't we, from Boyd Hunter about the ways in which land had been managed by Aboriginal people. But what, what do you need? Well, let's go through the kinds of factors and and how we find them in the early uh early colonial New South Wales. labour. So, convicts obviously provide the the core of the labour force. Aboriginal people were assumed to be few, but they are gradually in an uneven way absorbed into aspects of the colonial workforce. OK, so that needs to be recognised from the outset. So labour, but broadly speaking, um, it's, it's the labour of convicts that's critical in these early years. Now land, well we know about land, land was taken from indigenous people without a treaty. So from the point of view of the authorities, it's all very cheap, they didn't have to pay anything for it. And then, uh, could hand it on. It was often granted to settlers, um, in those early years. This allowed for agriculture and gardening, but seeds were damaged on the voyage out, the initial voyage out. And the soils and climate looked pretty rubbishy compared to what had been reported by Cook and Banks back in 1770. Remember, Cook and Banks arrive in uh uh Botany Bay in what, April? You know, pretty decent time of the year, when does the poor old, you know, first fleet arrive and what time of the year? January, yeah, a bit of a difference, hey, OK, so, um, that's an issue. That's an issue. The land looked less promising. There was, there were initial plans to import women from the Pacific Islands to, to effectively form households, marriages, sexual partnerships, not so much with the convicts, but with, uh, the jailers, you know, effectively with the, the, uh, Marines who had settled there, but that wasn't proceeded with, uh, the colony was having trouble feeding itself, let alone bringing in anyone else. Money, money's very interesting, there wasn't any. How the hell do you run an economy without money? Well, there was virtually none. I'll talk about that in a moment, but it's a fascinating story. There is no money, OK? They don't come with, you know, bags full of coins. This is how we're gonna sort of exchange things or whatever, there's none of that. So I'll talk about it at the moment. Trade, well, um. You know, uh, there's not much of this to begin with. Um, they, you know, there's only a couple of ships once the first fleet has, has basically done its deed and most of the ships are gone, so a couple of ships are left behind. There's nothing really to explore. It turned out that the flax and timber on Norfolk Island was not that good, um, and, and the sheer isolation of this place makes trade, um, pretty difficult, if not unviable, at least for the time being. Uh, you need entrepreneurship, and, um, you know, most of the residents of course were prisoners. There seemed to be few opportunities initially for officers in the absence of large numbers of ships arriving, but certainly things would change soon. And indeed many of those who had been convicts and uh some of those who were in the military did turn out to be pretty canny entrepreneurs. Um, government, well, government was very autocratic, OK, it doesn't exactly, um, leave open great opportunities for, uh, uh, entrepreneurship, and there's no treasury. I mean this is another thing, there's no government treasury. OK, so it's a very primitive kind of economic system that is first set up. Um, in the colonies. The key institution that emerges in this very early period is the commissariat. OK, the commissariat and I won't go through all of those things, but, uh, it, it is a key economic institution. It's effectively the government store. It's there to ensure that none of the convicts starve, that the colonists don't starve, that the people, um, there's a basic amount of clothing for, for especially for the convicts and for soldiers. Um, it, it's a de facto bank, so it essentially issues bits of paper. That, um, uh, had a, had a kind of official status, um, they could be, if you could bundle up enough of them, uh, they could be essentially exchanged back in London for pound sterling, for the, the, the, the currency of the day, but for gold actually. Um, now, that meant that you could use these bits of paper that were issued by the commissariat for trade because everyone knew that the commissariat was in the end backed by the British Treasury. OK, the British Treasury was not going to abandon the commissariat, it was gonna back any paper that it issued. Now you can see that this could lead to all sorts of corruption and mismanagement, it did occasionally, but it's a key institution. It's, uh, the officers sell their crops, um, the commissariat would basically buy any crop in the early years, uh, you know, any corn that was grown in the colony cause food was so short. So, oh, you've got some corn, thanks, and you could get quite high prices for it. Um, but yeah, it, it acts as a kind of the bank, uh, a kind of banker, de facto banker, um, it, it's a critical economic institution in the early, uh, history of, of, of the colony in the absence of other economic institutions, in the absence of banks, in the absence of a government treasury, in the absence of uh a currency. Moving right along The military officers very quickly establish a kind of trading monopoly. OK, and that also bears on the way the commissariat operates because they could buy cargoes from the ships as they came in and could sell them, or at least part of the what they bought, at inflated prices to the commissariat, or they could sell the cargoes that they got control of to private settlers at inflated prices. Again, because of the difficulty of getting goods in a colony so far from anywhere. So the military officers are able, they form a kind of ring. OK, kind of ring, they collude with one another to effectively establish a kind of monopoly among themselves, uh, with respect to trade. So they sell grain to the commissariat on land that's been granted to them, it's always willing to buy, um, and of course they get paid these bits of paper, these bills that I was just talking about, which could be exchanged for sterling, which meant they could use their bits of paper to buy the goods when they came in on the ships, cos the ship's captains, The ship's captains knew all that paper's alright. I can bundle up that paper, take it back to London, I get pound sterling for it. It's all very reliable. Um, there's a, a lack of distinction between public and private resources and all this. Our, our sense, you know, uh, some of you probably work in the public service, uh, you probably manage money in the public service. You're not allowed to take that money and go and invest it in, you know, some good thing that you've heard of down the street, right, if you did that, uh, Uh, even the NACC for all its failings would probably be on to you pretty quickly and you'd be in a bit of trouble. That's not how this worked, OK, that's not how this worked. Um, the, the paymaster, for instance, uh, the, the, the army paymaster was quite able to. There was no restriction on the paymaster investing the money that he was administering, you know, for soldiers' pay. Problems only occurred if he lost it. And that that's usually when the authorities would pounce. So William Cox was a paymaster in the early period, he invested some money badly, lost it, and yes, he was suspended, although he actually managed to more or less get away with it. Um, so what what's happening in this period is the military officers in a really good place to buy imports and to resell them at high prices. They establish a kind of trading monopoly. Um, I won't go into that in great detail. There is a kind of legend that, you know, rum or spirits were the currency of the colony in this early years. No, no, bits of paper, bits of paper, mainly. Um, IOUs, you've probably done an IOU, have you? Promissory notes, primitive checks really, they are, all of that sort of thing, they circulated widely. Um, but, uh, and certainly, you know, there, there was barter, exchange of one good for another, and liquor was something that could be used in those sorts of arrangements, um, but it's not the currency of the colony by any stretch of the imagination. OK. Yeah, that they, they can be used like other goods. It's not, it's it's not the current, I mean it's not, you, you sometimes read this stuff and you think it's kind of been used like coinage, it's not, it's.
