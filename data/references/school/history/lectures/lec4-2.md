SPEAKER 1
But Hello. It's 11:59. PM yeah so you know I always get, you know, things 11:58, 11:57, is it tomorrow or today? It's uh tomorrow. You joke, you're serious. Look.

SPEAKER 2
There's something odd on the, it's correct on the model,

SPEAKER 1
but there's something odd on the extension system which has a very 2023. Well there's nothing to do Some OK. Back, is there a I'm I Oh, I think I mean I think it's pretty straight forward. Oh yes, yes, it's like it's just like. The.

SPEAKER 2
It's a bit like asking someone their own telephone.

SPEAKER 1
I don't have you I don't really know exactly what. OK, um. Let's get into it.

SPEAKER 2
I begin with acknowledgements, the traditional owners and pay my respects to elders, past, present, and emerging. Uh, yes, we're ready to go. Um, I had, I, I sort of, um, brushed over very quickly. It was a good question last night about the gas industry in the colonial period, and I brushed it off rather too quickly, I think. I've put some more information on Wattle for anyone who's who's interested in how that that worked. I mean, basically, coal, shale oil to a lesser extent, were kind of the, what was burnt to, to basically make, make, um, oil. There were some experiments in sort of more natural forms of oil, but they usually failed. And it it in some ways, um, gas, oh sorry, gas I should say. I mean, gas is a good example actually of, of the importance of the 20th century, mid-20th century as a kind of turning point in in relation to economies, because I mean that is the moment where things like, you know, liquefied gas and, and uh oil obviously is becoming increasingly important in those decades. Um, so the, the, if you like the energy basis of the economy, um, is beginning to shift quite dramatically by the time we get to the mid, the mid-twentieth century, but, you know, the, the, the, if you like, the carbonised basis of the economy is a really important thing to keep in mind, and I think especially. As we talk about a topic like today's where, you know, I'll often be dealing with rather glitzy surfaces today of, of, you know, what social and economic life was like from the point of view of consumers, but keep in mind that all of this is being fueled by a certain type of energy order. And that um certainly carbon is a very important coal, carbon a very important part of that through the period that um I'm talking about with the qualifications that I added last night, I mean obviously the uses of hydro, in some places in in Tasmania in particular, it was very important, um, and various other things I said. OK, so let's talk about rise of consumer capitalism. Um, I think we may have even been over this one already, but you know, it's useful to reiterate, um, the long boom period from roughly the 1850s through to, uh, the depression, the end of the 1880s, beginning of the 1890s, you're talking about annual growth rates, average annual growth rates up, you know, pushing up towards 5%. In fact, very similar to what would happen in the second great long boom between uh the 1940s and the 1970s. Um, but look at those lower rates of growth, uh, between, well, 1920 to 1929, for instance, and that's even before the worst of the Depression era. So we're talking about a period of lower growth rates. Uh, I started out, in fact, I think I showed you these figures possibly even in the first lecture, and I pointed out that this is often used to construct a kind of parable about the Australian economy, you know, the idea we really should have just stuck to wool or something. Uh, or shouldn't have gone down a, a, a kind of protected manufacturing path and so on, um, but you know, I think that sort of approach is criticised quite justly by McLean in your, um, your textbook for this course, where he points out that inevitably the kinds of advantages that Australia's resource endowment, um, had given it in the 19th century. Um, we, we're beginning to, to dry up by the time you get to the, the end of the 19th century, that, that, um, inevitably in the context of, um, uh, you know, structural shifts in the economy, which I'll talk about today. Um, the, I think inevitable for Australia to shift towards a more industrialised economy, which was totally regarded as, as, uh, you know, synonymous with being economically modern, with being able to defend yourself in a in a increasingly dangerous world order, you know, win wars, for instance, so, uh, a more industrialised order, also a a a global um international scene where, Yeah, there is a transition to lower growth, I think is really important, particularly coming out of the First World War. I mean, we appear to be entering into an era of protectionism again at the moment. Well, this is the world of the interwar years. It was also a period of beg of thy neighbour, um, rising protectionism, countries attempting to, to kind of insulate their. Uh, economy from, uh, the depredations of other countries, OK, um, all of that was associated with the lower growth of, of the interwar years, so it's important, Australia's a small, quite exposed economy, I mean it's export economy, um, is, is an open one. it too, of course, adopts tariffs, which I'll talk about in a moment, the tariff increases in the early 20s and the early 30s, but broadly speaking, The Australian economy is very integrated with the international economy, OK, and if the international economy, global economy is going bad, you can be reasonably assured that the Australian economy is going to be affected very quickly, whether, you know, through the drying up of capital, uh, lower commodity prices, uh, greater difficulty in placing your products on the market, and so on. OK, so low average growth, uh, also structural imbalances and difficulties in the economy, um, uh, current account balances for Australia, um, Australia has a surplus in 1920, but then within about a year, it has a $43 million deficit, pound I should say, 43 million pounds deficit. Um, and of course this would become deeply problematic for the country in 1930, 1931, where, you know, this was experienced almost as a, a kind of a question of national insolvency, where the, um, current account went badly out of line, um, again as a result of, uh, uh, essentially falling commodity prices, um, and Australia's declining capacity in 1930, 1931 to pay its interest bills. OK. So there are structural weaknesses in the economy. Also keep in mind Australia takes out of the First World War quite a, I won't go into this in detail today, but comes out, takes out of the First World War quite a significant war debt. OK, Hughes did his best to try and renegotiate it to minimise Australia's obligations in the early 1920s as Prime Minister, but um on the whole, uh, lenders were were wouldn't have, wouldn't have it, essentially, um, they weren't prepared to, um, you know, reduce Australia's interest bills regardless of the kinds of arguments that Hughes put in his arguments were usually that Australia was paying, Higher interest rates than than British borrowers were paying on the the US market and these sorts of things, but generally they were rejected. Australia took out of the war a substantial war debt, to which it quickly added through its uh very substantial borrowing of the 1920s, particularly the borrowing by state governments. OK, this is a period of, Great borrowing for infrastructure, um, in the 20s, uh, and you know, some of those legacies are still with us in terms of the infrastructure that was built. Think of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, for instance, uh, opened in 1932. Think of something like the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, which was built from 1918 onwards into the 1920s. I think it's finished about 1932. Think of the electrification of uh households, street lighting, railways, um, you know, this is a period of substantial um infrastructure building, um, it, it is funded, as had occurred in the 1860s, 170s, and 1980s by borrowing on the, particularly the London market, and then in the 1920s, uh, increasingly on the United States market, the New York market, so Australia is beginning to turn. To American borrowers in the 1920s as as well, OK. Righto, so, um, let's get into it. So the post-war era, um, began, this is post-World War One era, of course, began with a strong emphasis on rural development in public discourse. There's a famous book from 1918 by uh EJ Brady called Australia Unlimited, and it was this idea that, Australia could expand almost indefinitely, that its population could be much larger in the future than it had been than it was in the present. Um, there was in fact a vigorous debate in the 1920s over the, the kind of population capacity. Of of Australia, um, which, you know, generated a great deal of controversy. Well, one geographer who had the temerity to argue that Australia's resource endowment meant that it's, uh, and particularly, um, it's uh the scarcity of water meant that it had a limited, uh, capacity to take on larger population. Decided that it would be better to uh have an academic career uh in the United States than in Australia, you know, so unpopular was that kind of view, so there was this very optimistic sense of Australia's possibilities that focused especially on rural development, where Australia was seen to have uh a a comparative advantage, OK, and particularly obviously pastoralism, the wool industry, cattle to a lesser extent, and uh the wheat industry. Um, but there was also this sense that that there were other possibilities for rural Australia too, and when I talk about some of these these um schemes of closer settlement, smaller farms, um, it wasn't usually sheep or wheat, um, that, uh, was, was in view. It it it was other products, uh, fruit. Uh, nuts, a whole range of more marginal agricultural products of that kind, where it was believed that if Australia could integrate itself more tightly with the British Empire, it would be able to to um take advantage of those markets and and uh and grow its um it's rural industries, so there'd be even greater economic rural diversification that had occurred in the past. Now British proponents of empire settlement argued that migration from Britain to dominions such as Australia, would enable men who had served their country in the war to contribute to imperial self-sufficiency as well as improving their own circumstances. There is a kind of autarchic vision of empire that that um uh is promoted in the 1920s and uh the 1930s. Do people know what auto autotaki is? Have you come across that term? So yeah, kind of self, a self-sufficiency, and so the idea was that you could maximise the, the trade, um, the exchange of peoples, migration of peoples, uh the exchanges of capital within the British Empire, in a way that would advan advantage all of its various uh components and indeed, Even in the 19 early 1930s, something I'll talk about in detail in a late election, not here, um, you have the foundation of something called the Sterling block, which was essentially a group of mainly empire countries, but with some sort of outsiders and some Countries didn't join the sterling bloc, but basically what the sterling block was is is a an association in um a kind of informal um association of countries that agreed to conduct their trade in pound sterling. Essentially, and to and to pool hard currency, so you, you, you know, your product, you know, as an Australian wool grower brought in American dollars, that was hard currency, and the idea was you shoved that in the sterling block's pool, and you drew on it, only in accordance with agreement with with those other sterling block countries. Now this is the system that prevailed from the early 1930s through to roughly, You could argue that the early to mid 1950s, um, I'll talk about that and how it worked and how it didn't work in more details next time, but you can see the kind of autarchic ambitions behind a scheme such as that that emerges out of the depression, but those ideas are there at a much earlier stage. Within Australia itself, um there'd been a persistent belief in the virtues of rural life. This had sustained things going back to, ah look, you know, you could go back to the um uh the, the big, Inquiry, where the idea was, you know, you, you send your your convicts out of shepherds into the bush, and they'll they'll somehow, you know, be more likely to reform their character as they reflect amongst the Arcadian splendour of the, of the, of the sheep paddocks. Um, so that, that idea's been around for a while, then the selection movement of the 1860s and 1970s, that movement to unlock the lands. Again, it has behind it this idea that the best kind of life is lived in in the countryside, in rural areas and particularly on, on farming. The farming had a particular moral virtue that that couldn't be captured in other forms of economic production. In fact, that it was something much greater than mere economic production. It was a kind of moral production. I think and and that that idea remains very powerful in Australia, in fact, in some ways it's resurgent, in the 1920s, um, following the, the First World War. Um, and it's linked to, to ideas about racial health, you know, the idea that that the war, you know, had, had, had carried off the cream of, um, that generation, you know, the lost generation, and that you could somehow replenish the racial stock and strengthen racial vigour through, through, um, uh, you know, through rural production, by putting, Um, basically men and men and their families onto farms where they could, uh, lead a healthy life and contribute to the vitality and production of the, the British Empire. And this involved ideas about migration. OK, the, the, the, you know, fundamental to it was the, the idea that the United Kingdom would send migrants out to the various dominions, especially returned servicemen. And so, you know, these kinds of ideas about soldier settlement, empire settlement they're in Australia, but you also get them in Canada in the same, the same period. OK. Um, so here's one of those schemes, um, this was a Western Australian one, it was called the, the group settlement scheme, and basically, you know, the Western Australian government makes an agreement with the British government that led to several 1000 assisted British migrants, so they're, Um, basically paid to come out or their passage is paid, and they became, as, as it was called, group settlers, communities of farmers working together to clear dense forest in WA and then to work small blocks under the guidance of capable supervisors. You could see what was what's happening here too. There's a kind of recognition. That many of these people lack the expertise to be, you know, sort of instant farmers, and so therefore they would need a series of supports in order to do that. So that's one scheme in in WA but of course there are soldier settlement schemes all over Australia, they begin in about 1916. Um, and these, uh, essentially envisage a returned soldiers being placed on the land on what was seen by government at least as relatively uh easy terms, you know, the idea being that those sturdy Anzacs, those diggers would also make fine farmers, and there's a whole mythology that attached to the ANZAC, the Australian in the First World War, the digger. That you know he was a natural soldier and he was a natural soldier because of the spirit of the bush. Now of course in reality, the bulk of those soldiers came from urban areas and relatively few of them had farming experience, but the mythology helped to carry these soldier settlement schemes, um, and there was also alongsided a belief that modern science, rather, as with the group settlement schemes. Modern science would kind of make up for any deficiencies that they might have as farmers, you know, that it could be modern science could be placed at their disposal that could overcome traditional problems that had long been an aspect of farming in Australia, which had blighted, for instance, the, the, the selection movement um back in the 1860s and 1970s, the fact that often. Um, cropping in particular on relatively small, um, areas was, was simply uneconomic in Australia, to take one example. Um, historians have, on the whole, um, tended to regard soldier settlement as a, as a failure, a costly failure. Um, but the, the, I mean, I looked into sort of the various studies of different localities a few years back, and it's actually a slightly more mixed picture than that, um, as far as I can see, where soldiers, settlers had good land of sufficient acreage, where they had decent, um, uh, Um, exposure to good transport network works for, for transporting their goods, um, and where they, they sort of had the qualities to live fairly simply and frugally in the early years, this was also important, um, that those early years can be very difficult, um, there is certainly plenty of evidence of success. OK, so there were examples of success, having some capital, of course, at your disposal, be very handy, not least sometimes in, Uh, amalgamating your farm with, with, uh, other land in the area that has been abandoned by unsuccessful soldier settlers or unsuccessful farmers. So there are certainly instances where, um, it did, it did work, but, you know, there are some notorious cases of, you know, hopeless pineapple farms up in Queensland or, you know, sort of chook farms in, you know, in, in places like um, You know, Western Sydney, for instance, which, which were were um not not terribly successful at all. OK, so, the, the whole faith in science thing is, is an important aspect, I think, of understanding how um, Australian elites thought of economic development in the 1920s and 1930s, OK, particularly in the 1920s. Science, and the other big word is efficiency, Science and efficiency. These ideas are everywhere. In the 1920s, they're often coming out of, you know, the emerging field of management studies, which some of you are probably still doing. Uh, in fact, you know, there was an Australian, uh, South Australian called Elton Mayo, academic who became very famous in that particular field. He, he made his career in the United States, so Australia made his own contribution to these, this body of, of emerging sort of industrial psychology, uh, in the 1920s and 1930s, um, and management studies. Um, but faith in science, a belief in the virtues of efficiency, very, uh, important, um, the federal government founds the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, now known of course as. CSIRO, um, in 1926, OK, so it's founded in this period, it's initially devoted, um, overwhelmingly to rural industry. OK, overwhelmingly to supporting rural industry, I think brings us back to the centrality of rural industries um to this whole story. It would later get into in the 30s, it would get into uh manufacturing and those sorts of fields, but very much uh and defence science and so on, but very much rural industry in the early years. The Prime Minister, oh there's some soldier settlers, um, again, you know, I think emphasising the range of, of experience around this is the kind of idealised image of the soldier settler, and here is a rather damaged return, uh, soldier settler, you know, trying to make the best of it, um, amidst great difficulty, um, after the war, and again, you know, you've kind of got some fairly idealised images alongside it, um. So, um, the Prime Minister of the period, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, um, was the principal, uh, you know, the, the CEO I suppose we'd say now of an importing firm in Melbourne, a family importing firm, um, a Cambridge graduate, a Gallipoli veteran, but in the British Army, not the Australian, he'd been in the United Kingdom, working in the in Britain when war broke out, um, but Melbourne born. Um, very, a, a strong believer in science, that science could contribute to economic welfare. He was instinctively, um, suspicious of, indeed even opposed to protective tariffs. As an importer, of course, um, tariffs were not a good thing. People who export and import tend not to be the greatest fans of tariffs because of the ways they interfere with trade. So that was sort of uh related I guess to the nature of the business that Bruce and his family had done, but more generally, he thought the tariffs as they'd applied in Australia were unscientific. They hadn't been applied to uh imports in a way that would actually effectively promote Australian industry. It was impossible by the 1920s for a prime minister to get up and say I oppose tariffs, let's get rid of them. That horse had bolted long ago. It had bolted basically in 198, really, if not earlier. So there was no question of being able to do that. But Bruce said that the tariff needed to be made more scientific. It needed to be set in a way that would maximise those industries where Australia was likely to be competitive and efficient. And that it shouldn't, uh, for instance, increase the costs of, um, rural industry, the most efficient, which, which, you know, were the most, and he saw as the most efficient industries in the country, so the tariff needed to be applied in a way that would be useful and scientific and and promote economic development, and wouldn't hinder the most efficient industries which were um primary industries. So there's a strong emphasis on that notion of, Of the scientific tariff. Now tariffs um were increased in the early 1920s before Bruce became Prime Minister while Billy Hughes, um, the wartime Prime Minister was still PM. And um this round of tariff revision, which occurred in 1921, is often called the green tariff, or, and that's not as in, you know, environmentally green, it's G R double E N E, after the um relevant minister of the day, Walter Massey Green, who saw it through parliament. Um, one of the things that, I mean, it increased tariffs generally, it increased tariffs. Um, but one of the things that, This round of tariff revision was trying to do really was to protect industries that had grown up under the natural protection of the First World War. So in other words, cessation of trade to the enemy, disruption of shipping, um, uh, you know, the, the uh general difficulty of getting goods to Australia during that period had promoted various forms of local production. OK, uh, where you had manufacturers already in place, they expanded their production, they sometimes expanded the range of products, um, and they've done this under the kind of, if you like, artificial artificial protection of a war. OK, now the problem was when the war's over and you've got some sort of gradual return to normal circumstances, what's gonna happen to that industry? Well, the argument went, it, it'll go down the tube unless it's protected. You know, so good examples, you know. Um, doll toy making, OK, a lot of dolls, you know, little girls' dolls had been imported from Germany before the First World War, and not surprisingly, you have Australian manufacturers suddenly getting into doll making during the First World War, but. You know, once ordinary kind of patterns of trade are are resumed, um, it's, it's very hard for them to continue, but they, they are essentially lobbying government to get protection, the unions that are represented by the work, you know, that are representing the workers in those industries are also lobbying. So piano production's an excellent example. This is Beal. Beale was a very well politically connected, um, uh, piano manufacturer. There's the factory. They've been producing since the 1890s, but, you know, a lot of pianos were imported from Germany, so the war gives the likes of Beal, um, new opportunities, and, and indeed they take those opportunities and of course they argue for tariffs, and I think they get tariffs from memory in that, Revision in the early twenties, so one of the things that's happening there is the kind of protection of these industries that have grown up. Now of course the problem is many of them were marginal, that is they were quite inefficient, OK, and this is really where Bruce is coming from, he's saying, well, you know, where do we stop? You know, at what point do we say, You're getting too much tariff protection that consumers would be better off if they could import their pianos, for instance, from Germany, or they can import their dolls from Germany instead of, you know, basically paying higher prices because of tariffs. The, the arguments are still with us, of course. It's all complicated by changes in the political order, and I won't go into this in great detail, but, um, very importantly, coming out of the First World War is a new political party. OK, it's the Country Party. OK, now the Country Party is instinctively suspicious of tariffs, in fact, instinctively opposed to tariffs because they're not to the benefit of wheat producers, wheat um exporters. They're not to the benefit of wool growers because they have to place their goods on an international market. And of course tariffs can also have the effect of increasing the prices of inputs into farming, you know, could be barbed wire, for instance, kerosene, whatever it happens to be that you're, you're using. So, um, the, the Country party isn't very enthusiastic about tariffs, but they are basically in the same position as Bruce. The horse has bolted. They know they can't oppose tariffs outright, and if they try doing that, they're gonna run into trouble, for instance, with potential bases of support in country towns which are dependent on manufacturing that's protected. Cause remember, factories don't just exist in Sydney and Melbourne, they're also growing up in in country towns as well, and that is the potential base of support, indeed it was the base of support for the Country Party, so they too have to make a kind of accommodation. With the tariff, what kind of accommodation does the Country Party make? We're gonna come in for our chop too, they said. So in other words, if urban manufacturers are gonna be protected, you can protect us with subsidies. You can protect us with bounties on various forms of rural production. You can help us with uh marketing assistance, OK? These sorts of ideas. So what, what you get from the 1920s is something that was later called protection all round, protection all round. It was a phrase that you got. Especially in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and what it meant is that the various interests in the Australian economy would all expect some degree of support from government as a kind of quid pro quo. So in other words, if workers were going to get a living wage, and if urban manufacturers were going to get tariff protection, that is uh uh taxes on on imports. OK, it's a, you know, kind of tariff wall, uh, the farmers were going to get protection too. OK, and you know it's a kind of irony really that the, the, the, the most enthusiastic, I'll come to this later in the course, most enthusiastic proponents of tariff protection by the 1960s were in the Country Party, because they could see how important it was if you were making white goods in the central west of New South Wales. You're gonna be in big, big trouble if the government basically took the tariffs off imported white goods, you know, things like washing machines and so on. This is how the economy would develop in the decades ahead, but in this early period, it's a bit more up for grabs, but there's there's no real prospect of being able of any political force being able to simply say we're not going to have tariffs anymore. So what you get instead is this kind of bargain, this quid pro quo between different interests. They all want to be protected. Doesn't this come back to that earlier argument about the utility of the state in Australia. Everyone thinks the state is there to protect it. The weakness of those more libertarian and free market ideas. OK. Remember WK Hancock, writing. Really in the midst of all this in 1930, in a book called Australia, Professor of history over in Adelaide, come, come back from Oxford, and what does he write? He says in Australia the people regard the state as one vast public utility. A vast public utility, he's responding to what's been happening in the 1920s, he's a perceptive observer of what's been going on. Every interest was looking to the state in the 1920s to protect it, to to to to protect its it's um it's wealth, OK, it's livelihood. Reason to be clear? OK. So, so, um, the slogan that the Bruce Page government um is often associated with, um, is, is men money markets, which you may have come across, this was the idea of, you know, the, the men, it's women too, of course, but they said men was about immigration, the resumption of significant levels of immigration for Britain, which happened in the 1920s. The money, of course, is borrowing, I've talked about that, the borrowing on the London money market in particular. Um, and, and markets that these particularly these newer forms of small scale agricultural production will find markets in the United Kingdom, that Australia will leverage its membership of the empire in order to allow those people producing dried fruits in the back blocks of New South Wales to sell their products on an international market. OK, so that was the kind of slogan, you can see how important the rule is to the whole, the whole concept. Now What I want to do just in in the next part of of of the lecture is, is really to talk about um less about the ideology, I've been talking here about ideology, I've been talking about policy. What I want to talk about next is what happens, because what's striking about this is, is the kind of divergence really between a kind of rural, imperial masculinist vision of the Australian economy, which I think we've seen. Look at all that masculinism there, not there, there. You know, And what's actually happening in the economy, which is quite different. Look at it, look at it, here's some figures, um, pastoralism in agriculture is a share of GDP. 1919, 28%, it's declining. It's declining in the interwar years, it's down to 1/5 of the economy by 1939, the eve of the war. Mining sort of sits. In a stable, much of that's gold mining, OK, um, so 4%, 3%. Um, look at manufacturing though. This is the industrialization of Australia on the eve of, if you want to know why Australia was able to basically defend itself in the Second World War, there's a figure that helps. OK, you know, it's a myth that Australia, you know, survived because of the United States. Australia survived because it was capable of defending itself and because it had stuff that was going to be of value to the United States, and the reason it had staff was not just because of this. Because of this, OK, it was a country capable of producing aeroplanes, for instance, by World War II. So the industrialization of Australia, and of course it's, it's, it's manufacturing, which I'll I'll talk about in a moment, which is also very geared towards a consumer economy, and that too became very important in the Second World War, as I'll talk about later. Services always, we go right back to the earliest years of European Australia, British Australia, represent, The preponderance of the economy, OK, everything from education, insurance, banking, take your pick. So services are always in a modern economy of this kind, very, very predominant. But these shifts here are very important. They matter because despite all the, the, the rural talk, this is a country that's that's industrialising. It's industrialising for a with with its small population quite rapidly and it would be even more rapid. In 6 years of the Second World War and and the years following. OK, so, let me talk a bit about this, this consumer economy, um. One of the things that's happening during the 1920s is a great period of suburban expansion. So if one of the things that's going on is that many of the, the kinds of benefits of modernity are being shared by people in the country, particularly country towns, I'm thinking there of electrification and a whole range of road building, which I'll talk about in a moment. It's also a huge period, a very important period of urban development and urban growth. So we think of the suburbanization of the 50s, but it's happening in the 1920s. Cities like Sydney and Melbourne are expanding rapidly out, outwards. Um and it, it's no longer just along the railway routes, which I think I talked about in an earlier lecture. You're getting bus networks that are developing, for instance, and most importantly, as I'll suggest in a moment. The motor car is beginning to make an impact on where people can live, OK, the Sydney decision to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge is fundamental, of course, to that. So, so and, and, you know, there's an example of a 1920s house, the Californian bungalow, you can see they're quite comfortable. You've probably seen thousands of these in your lifetimes, as you've lived in Australia, um, very much a product of this suburban moment in the 1920s. The, the inner cities of course are are already in decline. OK, the, the very inner parts of the cities, which were the first suburbs in Australia, places like Redfern in Sydney, Fitzroy in Melbourne. Um, they are in decline in in this period and becoming associated with political corruption, with organised crime, including gun crime, you know, sort of American style gangster violence on a smaller scale. All of that, um, is attaching itself to these sort of decaying and declining inner cities, um, or inner suburbs, uh, prostitution, for instance, is concentrated, sex sex sex work is concentrated in that inner ring of of suburbs around the central business district. Um, and, and people are expanding outward, and you can see the way in which suburbanization, if you look at advertisements, I'm brought in today, you look at advertisements for suburban development in the 1920s, they're actually appealing to the rural idyll. This stuff, they're appealing to this, you know, the idea that in a suburb, you could combine the benefits, the conveniences of city life, you could have your electric uh uh jug or whatever, but at the same time, the benefits of being away from the city and away from a city that increasingly looks rather dodgy, and particularly the the the inner city. OK. So, um. What kind of lifestyles are sustained in Australia of the 1920s? Now you might notice. Look, Yes, that's my grandfather's business and his bro, a brother, my uncle Tony was really the business. So they, they basically sold cars from about World War One onwards in a country town in northwestern Victoria, in the Wimmera, in Nill. This turned up at a car club, a Cadillac club a few years ago, imported by Bongiorno Brothers in 1924, um. Oh nice, isn't it? um, but that's how they made their living, and I think what it expresses is the car ownership is becoming, Much more common and particularly I think for for for um farmers who, who are more likely to be able to afford it, even if by going into debt than um certainly the working class in cities. It's still largely out of the the the the reach of ordinary working class people living in cities and towns, but it's becoming within the grasp of, uh, middle-class people in cities and towns. And farmers and of course graziers, and of course they're making their money by selling to to farmers and graziers through Western Victoria as well as, you know, well-off people in the towns and, and, uh, you know, they make a fortune doing that really. Even to the extent that by the 1930s, you know, there's uncle Tony off on a business trip with other local businessmen to Japan, um, you know, he says some. Appropriately racist things about the Japanese, which he thought was praising them, how clean they are and this sort of stuff, as people did in the 1930s, but basically, you know, it, it expresses the kind of economic ambition that very interestingly manages to survive the depression. OK, that's one of your readings you've got for this week, I think points that out, that despite the ordeal of the depression, the consumer economy remains pretty buoyant, um. So, cars, as I said, they remained expensive. The cheapest models of the 20s, about 200 pounds, right? Um and that's, you know, that would have been 9 months pay for an ordinary labourer, so that's not something that an ordinary worker is going to do, but a farmer or a middle-class person, possibly with access to credit, of course, could do it. OK. Keep in mind you don't have full production of cars in Australia, they're either fully imported. Like this very expensive one was, well, sometimes they're being assembled, and I, I mentioned this briefly last night, um, old saddlers and carriage makers from the horse industry, sometimes repurposed as essentially assembly, um, points for cars, and, and indeed you get quite modern forms of assembly line. Developing at places like Holden by the 1920s, sometimes they'd draw on locally made components, usually the chassis, the bottom bit, the great big bit at the bottom would be imported, um, engines would often be imported, but other components would be sourced locally, so this is the emergence of a car industry. In Australia of the 1920s and 1930s, which is producing cars, more cheaply than they had been before, and this is the year of the Model T Ford, OK, Germany of course in the 1930s, the year of the Beetle. OK, so there's an attempt to reach out beyond the middle classes to a larger cohort. So that's happening in the twenties. It requires infrastructure, most importantly, it requires roads, and they are expensive. They're expensive, it's expensive to build roads that are capable of taking large numbers of cars. This is where the loan money is going on this sort of stuff. And it's often in cities. OK, it's often in cities, so suburbanization in Sydney, of course, has a great boost in the 1920s and then even more after 1932 when the bridge opens. Obviously it allows an expansion into, uh, you know, north of the harbour that really hadn't been possible before, um, because you, you, you know, you couldn't uh easily travel across. I mean, people obviously got ferries and all the rest of it. But it, it made those northern suburbs of Sydney, for instance, much more accessible to the central business district and made them more attractive as places to invest, to, to build businesses, to um uh do housing development and so on. Um, the development of modern advertising, I think is an important part of this business. Uh, thousands of homes in the 20s are connected to electricity supply. It doesn't come for free, OK, again, this is where the loan money's going. A lot of it's going, there's a great irony here, isn't there? The ideology, Australia Unlimited, it's all about rural development, all those farms, you know, all that produce. Where are the loan moneys going? Building a bridge over Sydney harbour. OK, electrifying the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. OK, you can see the. The disjuncture there, if you like, between what people are saying about the economy. And, and, and where actual economic investment is, is going. There are resemblances here obviously to the 1870s and 1880s, you can, you can see the or hear the echoes, I think. Um, so development of modern advertising is a part of this, exposure to the consumer economy through film, uh, magazines, helped convince many Australians that what they regarded as luxuries yesterday were necessities today, um. Still, it's, it's worth keeping in mind that many houses, particularly in some of the older inner urban areas, even as late as the 1940s, did not have running water in the house. OK, so there's great unevenness. The newer suburbs often have quite, you know, modern houses with hot water and all the rest of it, but many older houses uh don't, and uh, Um, you know, uh, there was great unevenness, I think, in, uh, the nature of Australia's economic development in these sorts of periods. However, I'll come back to that, I think, um, it, it, it is a period where manufacturing is, uh, developing many iconic products, um, associated with sort of Australian modernity emerged in this period. Um, and, and of course a lot of the, the development isn't heavy industry, it's things like food processing that are geared towards that consumer economy. So a good example of this is Fred Walker and Co. which is around from the early 20th century, in fact, he started it in Asia when he was about 19, as an importing and export company, um, but then, Basically fails, re-establishes in in Melbourne in the mid 1920s, actually a bit a bit earlier, sorry, he re-establishes in Melbourne before the First World War, but then it really takes off in the mid 1920s, and he enters into an alliance, a partnership with Kraft, which is an American company and of course you all know what happens from there. Um, processed cheese, which we take for granted these days, is a product really of this period in Australia, and he also pioneers this ghastly. Ghastly stuff, um, from 1923, um, Vegemite, which apparently they said was good for you. Anyway, each to their own. Um, so it, it, it first retails in 1924. OK, I don't really mean to say, I'm sure, you know, some people think it's great. I don't like it myself, but each to their own, um, Vegemite. So there you go, um, that that's an example of the kind of, of industrial concern that's developing in in this period, and, and it's, it's obviously intimately connected to um the consumer economy, but, you know, um things like toothpaste, powder. Um, uh, you know, um, face creams, lipstick, and nail polish for women, all these kinds of things are being pushed very aggressively by the 1920s through modern forms of, of advertising. Um, there's a strong emphasis, and you can see also the gendered aspects of this. There's a strong emphasis on women's identity, um, on women cultivating their own selfhood through consumerism. OK, and there's a whole literature on this for Australia as for other places, um, that that is an aspect of this uh consumer economy. Um organised sport, um, is, is another important aspect of uh the consumer economy, uh, in this period, that's a a a VFL Victorian Football League Grand Final from the mid-twenties, you can see it attracted enormous, Enormous sorts of crowds, um, horse racing was very popular in the period, cricket, of course, as well, uh, women and men. OK, so women's cricket was, uh, attracted crowds of thousands in the 1930s in, in Australia, so don't imagine that these things only just happened more recently. But things like, you know, branded breakfast cereal, branded chocolate and confectionery, all these kinds of things are really taking off in the 1920s and and 1930s. Um, uh, people are defining themselves differently, they're defining themselves in terms of consumption. OK, there's a shift away from the household as a place of production. Traditionally, households have been very important sites of thing of production, a production of eggs, through having chooks in the backyard, jams, clothing, a whole range of things. Now that didn't stop in the interwar years, but there is a a shift away from that, that kind of trend, and we'll get rid of that. Um, Fresh fruit and vegetables, of course, there's, there's some more Italians for you, that's my mother's family, that's what they're up to in the 1920s. There you go, they're selling fruit and vegetables. But there, there is, um, and there is a growing awareness of the importance of vitamins, of certain kinds of foods being healthier, uh, than others, but most people ate very heavily, OK, so meat, 3 veg, uh, it wouldn't pass muster today. I often think that, When we look at all those politicians in Australia who died at the age of about 60 or 65, it was after a life of too much tobacco and too many chops, I suspect, so. Um, that was fairly important, um, in terms of entertainment, uh, the radio emerges in the 1920s as a key form of home entertainment. Uh, it's, uh, both commercial and public, so it has both dimensions, a commercial dimension and a public dimension. Uh, you needed a lot in the early days, for instance, a licence to access the commercial networks on, uh, radio, but also the cinema and the dance hall. And again, I mean, it's worth thinking about the gendered nature of, of that particular form of entertainment. Here again, were places for female selfhood to be expressed through consumer, um, uh, activities through consumption. OK, I'm going to leave all that there, um, and just finish up really um by pointing out that um, The jazz age, the 1920s, is, is often, you know, treated, I think, in the literature as a a.
