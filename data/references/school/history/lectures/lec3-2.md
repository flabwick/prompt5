SPEAKER 1
OK, I've got to start. Um, again, um, acknowledgements to traditional owners, Nuwar Namburi and pay my respects to their elders past, present, and emerging. Um, OK, so what I want to do today is to take us through from the Depression of the 1890s to World War One, so not, not covering as much subject matter as usual today. So, gosh, we might even get out early. Imagine that. Let's see how we go. Um, we probably won't. Uh, I'll begin by talking a bit about, um, I will, I'll look at the boom just very briefly first, so where we sort of left off last night, the boom of the 1880s. It wasn't, um, an even boom across Australia. Uh, South Australia entered a depression really by the 1880s, um, but certainly Southeastern Australia, Victoria in particular, boomed right through to the, the late 1880s. So I'll talk briefly about that. Then talk about the depression of the 1890s as well as the recovery from it, a little bit on the Federation era settlement that emerges out of the depression, which is immensely important for our understanding of Australian political economy, uh, generally, because this became really the basis for, um, you know. Policy, uh, really for the next 80 years up until um the beginning of its dismantlement in the 1970s really and then more radically in the 1980s and 1990s, and then I'll talk very briefly about the impact of the First World War, um, so. Let me get in just very briefly talking about the boom. Um, urban life in particular, um, flourished in Australia between the 1860s and the 1880s. That's, um, a very famous painting by Tom Roberts, in fact, it's owned by the National Library here in Canberra, rather than the National Gallery, it's a bit unusual, but anyway, there it is, uh, Allegro Combrio. Do we, do we have any Italian speakers here? Allegro Combria, what would it be Allegra, lively and fast Cobre with spirit. With spirit, would that be right, sort of spirit anyway, you can see, but otherwise, um, more prosaically Bourke Street West, but you get a sense of um the the liveliness of central Melbourne in this period, you'll you'll notice, uh, you know, this is not a period of. Fishermen or concrete, uh, so lots of dust, uh, perhaps even has a slight wild west connotation to it in some ways, um, and, and no sewers, very important. No, there's no Melbourne wasn't sewer until the 1890s, and that meant that, yes, you're, I'm afraid. Yes, urine excrements just flowed down the sides of the street, uh, particularly once it rained. Very unpleasant and very unhealthy, which is, is really what lies behind the figures that I gave you at the very end of last night's lecture, you know, where you have infant mortality rates up around 150 per 1000, and that's um really to do with the unhealthiness of urban life and certainly uh diseases such as typhoid, cholera didn't really get into Australia, um but typhoid, Uh, were, were, um, a, a, a major problem, but children could die of a whole range of diseases, measles and so on. Um, urban life had an unhealthy aspect, and you can see it in figures. I mean, rural, living in the, in the country was simply healthier, um, and, and that has a lot to do with the fact that, um, that the city has well and truly outgrown it's, it's, um, infrastructure by the time you get to the end of the 1880s. This is one of the biggest cities in the world. OK, I don't think anyone would talk of Australian cities today as among the biggest cities in the world because we have so many megacies. In 1880, 1885, 1890, Melbourne's one of the biggest cities in the world, and yet, yes, no sewing. Um The development of transport, uh, trams, trains, um, omnibuses, ferries in Sydney, of course, very important, permitted people to live greater distances from their workplaces. So in the 1880s we're talking about really not the first, but one of the great cos they're actually earlier periods, but one of the great periods of suburbanization in Australia. And the cities develop a bit like octopuses or spiders if you like, because you've got the centre. And then the transport routes, of course, which are basically train and sometimes tram routes, the trams are initially pulled along by horses, um, before they, they, uh, electrify and so on. um but they they they basically go out like, like an octopus, big arms, and people would settle along the tram and particularly train routes, um, and so you had great. Big empty spaces in between where people generally didn't live until the development of bus transport, which would link up different train and tram routes and so on. So if you, you kind of, you know, could, could look, look at all this on a chart, the Australian cities look look a bit like spiders or octopuses in in this period of the 1880s. There were some outrageous in. Particularly outrageous plans for building railways. There was one called the Outer Circle that was going to sort of wind its way through the the sort of expanding suburbs in a great big circle as a way ostensibly of connecting them up. In reality, one of its objects was to increase the price of land, of course, um. And uh um in some ways, some of the uh railway development in Melbourne in recent years has revived aspects of these outrageous 1880s plans, but anyway, there was an outer circle railway that was never completed. There was an inner circle railway that I think was partially completed. You'll still find bits and pieces of track in in Melbourne from those, those um uh projects of the 1880s. But it's an expression of the confidence, I think, of the boom period um which particularly centred on Melbourne. Um, home ownership was quite widespread by international standards, about 1/3 of dwellings in metropolitan Sydney were owner occupied or people were paying them off via a loan. In Melbourne it was even higher, it was over 40%. OK, so that, that phenomenon of home ownership was, was prevalent in, in, in uh um Australia by the 1880s. Um, so it's a high level of home ownership, the abundance of, um, attractive and relatively cheap land in Australian cities, uh, the absence of a hereditary landlord, so you didn't have landlords skimming some of the, the, you know, rent effectively from land, which is what you still get in the United Kingdom. Um, and the readiness of colonial governments to provide transport and other services, they just went and borrowed in London and they built their railways, OK, um, they went into massive debt, which of course they would pay mightily for when it all went badly in the 1890s. They were basically close to insolvency, these governments, along with many private businesses. Um, so, uh, infrastructure, uh, supports that suburbanization. We have another great period of suburbanization again with over borrowing in the 1920s, which I'll get to, uh, next week. Um, building societies provided credit, um, you don't see building societies much anymore, but these were sort of non-bank financial institutions that didn't have, um, well, banks weren't really regulated in this period either, but, uh, building societies sort of sprang up. And they played an important role in promoting high levels of home ownership. They could, they would allow people to borrow on relatively easy terms. Again, you can see where all this is going. We all know what happens when you have institutions that allow people to borrow on relatively easy terms, you know, you've got people encouraged to invest in these building societies, to put the family, you know, uh savings into them because you'll make lots of money because land prices are going up and everyone's building, it'll be great. Well, it was great until about 1889. So, building societies provide credits, um, Melbourne's land boom saw a massive increase in prices, um, you know, during the 1880s. By 1888, 1989, a square yard or a square foot of land in central Melbourne's about the same price as London. OK, so, you know, this has been a massive increase in the price of land. It's a classic speculative bubble. Share prices of course are going up, people are investing in, you know, land companies are investing in building societies in particular, um, and it's an asset bubble, it's a classic asset bubble in the 1880s. I, I refer here to Melbourne because this is where it really centred. OK, the boom is happening in other places, it's happening in Sydney as well, but it's particularly centred on Melbourne. Melbourne is also important because of the amount of money that's floating around. It's also fueling investment elsewhere. Broken Hill, have people been to Broken Hill? know about Broken Hill? Any people don't know. marvellous town even now. Uh, Broken Hill, um, basically saw a major discovery of silver, lead and zinc in 1883. So Broken Hill's about, I, I actually drove it January last year. I've never been to Broken Hill. I decided it was time I went and saw it. It's about 12 hours' drive from here. Uh, out close to Adelaide and Sydney, but it's over, it's in within New South Wales, a fabulously rich load of um load LODE of silver, of silver, lead and zinc. OK, and it's developed in the 1880s, um, it's, it's a boom town, an absolute boom town, it eventually becomes the largest inland city in Australia until, um, Canberra eventually would overtake it. But um it it's, it's a a boom town. And, and mining is absolutely booming, it's silver mining predominantly in in Broken Hill in, in that period. But it's fueled by Melbourne Investment. OK, it's fueled by Melbourne Investments. I mean this was, you know, eventually would be called the Collins Street. Group because a lot of the offices, the headquarters if you like, of the Broken Hill companies were in Collins Street in Melbourne. OK, so Melbourne's fueling that. Melbourne, as I mentioned briefly I think last night, it's Melbourne Investment that's also fueling. Um, a pastoral boom, there's a massive increase in sheep numbers, there's an expansion into margin increasingly marginal lands in western New South Wales, in western Queensland, again, it's Melbourne money. It's Melbourne money, OK, and Melbourne money is also spreading out, fanning out into the Pacific, into investment in Pacific islands, so it's, it's basically uh an incredibly vibrant commercial empire, but it's it's a bubble, it's a classic um uh investment bubble. So vast fortunes were made. You still see evidence of this in Melbourne today, drive through Toorak and uh Saint Kilda, and you'll see remnants of this, these Italianate mansions. He's one of them in Saint Kilda from the 1880s, built with the proceeds of these kinds of investment in that period, OK, and, and there's still, you know. Really significant numbers. Some date from a bit earlier, but there was a lot of construction of these by merchants and others in the, the 1880s. And that's, that's a, I think that was a, um, a home that had been built earlier, but the facade you can see there is an 1880s facade. It's, it was completed at the end of the 1880s, so just as the boom was about to collapse. You can see it's extravagance. It's on an incredibly extravagant scale and if you want to go and have a look, there's there's actually it's a, it's a museum now, I gather. I haven't been myself, but you can actually see the insides of it as well if you go and have a look online at the Heritage Victoria, I think it is, or National Trust, and you can see just how lavish also the interiors of this building um were, and, and indeed they've been preserved. So. That's the end of the 1880s, the depression of the 1890s when it came, um, shook the confidence of, of this society to its very foundations. Land prices collapsed. And of course people had borrowed heavily, they were highly leveraged to to buy up to speculate in land, so they often had vast debts. The banks crashed. This is immensely important for understanding the 20th century history of Australia. The banks went down, people lost their savings, OK? People lost their savings. Banks crashed in Melbourne, they crashed in Sydney as well, and this would give a particular complexion. To the politics of finance in the decades that followed, if you want to know why one of the first things that a majority labour government does in 1911, when it comes to power, it founds what? What's it found? What's it established in 1911? It's a private company now, public company. No, the Commonwealth Bank. Well, yes, yes, you're quite right in a way. I mean, the RBA emerges out of the Commonwealth Bank in 1960. Yes, it eventually takes on reserve Bank functions as you'll hear from Selwyn Cornish in his lecture in a few weeks. But yes, the Commonwealth Bank is. Is the beginnings of the Reserve Bank. The Commonwealth Bank today is the privatised version of that, you know, that public state bank established back then. It was very much about the idea of a people's bank that would look after the people's earnings. It would have behind it government. OK, would have behind it the authority, the power, the security of government. It could not crash in the way that the banks of the 1890s had crashed with people losing their savings. The hostility to finance capital, what they call the money power of uh labour movement figures, but also sometimes of the Country Party and and and uh farmers in the 20th century was a legacy, a legacy of the bank crashes of the 1890s. OK, so banks crashed and unemployment ballooned. We don't really know the rates, probably 1 in 3 workers. There's massive internal movement of peoples as a result, massive unemployment in the east leads to people travelling west where the goldfields of Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie were opening, those eastern gold fields in Western Australia. OK, so a lot of people are going over from Melbourne, from Sydney, particularly from Melbourne though, to uh those, those gold fields in the 1890s. Now why does it all happen? Why did the causes, now you won't be surprised to hear there are different theories about this, Broadly speaking, the two sets of ideas focus on domestic and external factors. So one set of ideas comes from Noel Butlin, um, economic historian, you've got some reading from him, and his idea is that, The boom, so his starting point is the boom of the 1860s, 1970s, and 1980s. Economic growth in Australia in that period is really about urbanisation. It's about urban manufacturing, but especially it's about urban construction. And public borrowing, that is governments going off to the City of London to borrow money. This is fuel this is what is fueling economic growth, not the state, his is an anti-staple theory. So he's more sceptical of the role that things like wool exports play. He believes it's been, it's a bit like the James Balich idea that I talked about a couple of lectures ago. It's kind of an an earlier theory of of of explosive colonisation about the self-sustaining way. In which urban development kind of creates its own momentum, you know, so you concentrate people in cities, they create demand for housing, people build houses, OK, it kind of, it has a self-sustaining aspect. So, um, Butlin's argument is that's, that's the nature of economic growth in Australia in the 1860s, the 1870s and 1880s. The crisis comes because you're getting overinvestment, private and public investment. In what are essentially not very productive parts of the economy, the most productive parts of the economy are. Where, where, where's the really productive stuff? Yeah, mining, there's certainly mining continues, gold mining, for instance, keeps going in the 1870s and 1980s, it takes off again actually at one point in the 1880s, but you know, what's the really big stuff in Australia? It's so good, it's particularly pastoralism, it's wool, OK, so, you know, that's really the most, if you like, productive part of the economy, that's where Australia has its natural advantage. But investment, he argues, was disproportionately being concentrated in what was essentially speculative urban um investment by both governments and by private investors, OK, and that this kind of distorts the economy. Um, and, and eventually in the context of, you know, um, a, a speculative bubble, it leads to a, a collapse. So a kind of the, the, the concept is an internal disequilibrium, if you want the sort of economic jargon, there was an internal disequilibrium, that is the investment was concentrated in, you know, what was arguably the wrong places, OK? Right, so, Um, or at least, you know, uh, the scale, he's not suggesting that there shouldn't have been investment in urban areas, he's saying that that the scale of it meant that you had this internal imbalance that was fundamentally destabilising. So that's the emphasis on the domestic side. Others have have argued that external factors um were really important um and and may have been um the most important. For instance, there's a drying up of British investment around 1890. OK, so this is an economy that has become addicted in a lot of ways to borrowing in London. For private purposes, for for mining, uh for um for pastoralism, for some forms of urban enterprise, but particularly for government infrastructure. I mean this is how the railways are built, they do not fund railways from taxes, I can assure you, those railways are really expensive. They were funded basically by going off to the City of London. And uh taking out a loan and and uh the the the lenders, institutions and individuals in the United Kingdom who reckon there's a buck to be made by uh lending to Australian governments. OK, that that's how that's all happening. So this is happening on a grand scale, but investment dries up. This is a very exposed economy. It's an exposed economy because it's, it obviously has, it's an export economy, it's an open export economy with its and and with a very, you know, pretty narrow range of export commodities, right? We're talking mainly wool, a few other bits and pieces, gold remains of some significance, but heavy dependence on, on, on wool. So, uh, but it's also incredibly exposed to the drying up of investment capital. OK, once that drain and we're gonna see this all over again. When are we gonna see it next, do you think? When are we going to see all that, the same story basically playing out again, this is 1890, when's the next one? Yeah, 1930. Same story, very similar, very similar. So commodity prices are declining, wool prices are going down here, and wool prices again would go down in 1930. Drying up of British capital here. By 1930, it's a bit of US capital as well, but it's mainly, it's it's almost exclusively British capital. The London money markets drying up in 1890. OK, so very similar sorts of story. So, um, there's a panic, by the way, uh, create, created by the near collapse of Bearings Bank. So one of the sort of major London banks, uh, um, uh, essentially got tied up in a, in a scandal. Um, the, the bank doesn't exist anymore, bearings cause it had a second one in the 1990s, about 1995, and uh it uh it was a trader, what was his name, Nick someone I, a trader in Singapore, I think, in Asia. Just, um, you know, did some extraordinary things that destroyed the whole bank. Yes, it was possible to do this in the 1990s, but anyway, bearings was also um behind uh the the panic, the international panic that occurs in around 1990, um, particularly bad loans, bad debts in Argentina. OK, and that that creates Argentina, whilst an independent republic, is essentially in a lot of ways a part of a British economic empire. It's incredibly integrated with the British economy and uh very, very dependent on British capital, uh heavily dependent on British markets for, for Argentinian meat, for instance, OK, so. Um, you know, this, this is a really an imperial story in many respects. So there's a kind of international panic and for a vulnerable economy like Australia's exposed, those external factors, it's in trouble. So they're two different theories, you can probably put them together in a way, I think you could actually think about the ways in which the kind of domestic vulnerabilities of the economy, You know, that that that internal imbalance that Butlin refers to means that when you have an international panic that occurs in over finance and borrowing and and debts in 1890, it means an economy such as Australia's is incredibly vulnerable. In fact, it's structured very similarly to Argentina's and and there's, you know, a, a long tradition of comparison between the two colonies. So if, if there, you can imagine how investors are thinking. I mean, psychological factors matter here. They can see Argentina's in trouble, Argentina has an economy just like Australia's. What are you gonna do if you're an investor? You're not gonna be too optimistic about the prospects of Australia's largely rural-based export economy, are you? So that's really one of the things that's happening here. OK, people clear on that, any questions or pretty clear. Yeah, yep, OK, good, alright, um, so, um, let me move on. Whatever the causes of the depression, its consequences were dramatic. Um, so, uh, men and women uh who'd invested their money in the companies of Melbourne's land boomers lost everything. Good example, Alfred Deakin. You know, famous Victorian politician, eventually Prime Minister of Australia 3 times, was in the Victorian, he's a government minister in the 1880s, leader of the Liberal Party, um, he takes the family savings, including his parents' savings, puts them in one of these dodgy building societies or whatever, and they lose basically everything. OK, so he has to spend the 1890s, he remains in parliament, but he remains out of governments, and he spends the 1890s trying to recover the family's finances because of these bad investments. That's just one example, OK, but a lot of people lost a lot of money, banks and building societies crashed. Uh, pillars of the community, you know, the, the sort of respectable wealthy people who inhabited those kinds of this, this kind of establishment, essentially went to the wall. There was a a a very dodgy set of arrangements, um, that were, I mean, you know, basically a form of well it's corruption essentially, a dodgy set of arrangements allowed, Um, uh, someone, a, a, a, a, a, you know, a debtor, someone with huge debts, to essentially enter into a secret, um, arrangement with creditors, uh, that involved the payment of, of, I think it was a, you know, a penny in a pound of debt. Uh, these were called secret compositions, and basically what they involved is the formal, um, avoidance of bankruptcy. But it was all in secret, so you didn't know who was still good, who was still a good credit risk and who wasn't. You didn't know who owned, who, who possibly owed £500,000 and who was solvent, because it was all being done in secret. It was a way really of avoiding, Open bankruptcy, OK, but this, this is basically what's going on in Melbourne in the 1890s, pardon me. So, um, unemployment is huge, um, you know, um, men, sometimes families, um, go to the country in search of work, sometimes families were left behind in the cities. Melbourne becomes a very depressing place in the 1890s. In fact, it's sometimes been argued that if you want to think about how is it that the bush, you know, the the countryside, the bush becomes so important to the national mythology. One argument is that up to 1890, in fact, the city through images like that one. The city had kind of competed with the bush in Australian mythology because, you know, these cities were so vibrant, they were so lively. But with the decline of city life in the 1890s depression, there's a turning to the bush and to the, the, the, the, the wool industry, to the noble bushmen, the shearer, as a more central to the national mythology, that it's, it's it's in many ways a product of the 1890s and certainly the major proponents of that bush legend, that mythology, you think of Henry Lawson or Banjo Paterson. They're all active in the 1890s and living in cities. They, they have the, the decline of the cities right in front of them. They can see it, they're experiencing it, sometimes they're struggling writers who had been able to make money in the 1880s as writers but couldn't do so anymore in the 1890s. They could do it in the 1880s but not the 1890s. OK, so, alright, um, so, um, All of this is compounded because from 1895 through to about 1902, drought. You have what's called the long drought, it's a bit, it foreshadows the the one we had more recently called the Millennium, millennium drought, I think we called it, of a few years back. It went for years, it reached its worst stage in 1902. Um, this basically helped to delay what would otherwise have been an economic recovery, OK, the drought, because this is such a, an agriculturally and pastorally based economy, the drought was quite devastating. Now the period from the mid 1890s does see, however, a slow economic recovery. But it's been noticed and this is quite interesting, I, I didn't fully realise this until I read your MacLean book a few years back. Um, the Australian colonies did not share fully in the favourable global economic conditions that emerged in the 1890s. This is very unusual. Normally the relationship between a a relatively open export economy, it's been a bit different from for imports, but, Generally speaking, if the global economy has done well, so does the Australian economy. OK, it normally flows over into the Australian economy. This appears to be one of the periods in which there is a sort of dislocation, and that's an interesting puzzle. McLean's argument is that, Um, the decisions that were made by governments in the 1890s, and particularly their incapacity to do things like regulate the banks, meant that there was a kind of long period where you don't really have a solid recovery. So whereas other economies, if you like, had better institutions to deal with the depression and with the bank crashes and all the rest of it. Australia with its six colonies and they, you know, they all got basically separate systems, they have separate railway gauges, all of this sort of stuff, um, what was a kind of hindrance to to economic recovery. OK, so, you know, when there's another depression in the 1930s, obviously the institutional environment has changed entirely. You have a single Commonwealth, you have a federal government that's better able to manage the economy. Uh, in the 1930s, um, still with great difficulty, of course, but you don't have a single national economy doing, uh, a government doing that in the 1890s, so that's one of the, the, the arguments that, um, you know, the depth of the economic depression in Australia, the bank crashes and all the rest of it. It is a kind of um it's an enduring problem that stretches all the way into the first decade of the 20th century, and it's not really until the years directly before the First World War that you get, you know, genuine signs of economic recovery. Um, you know, really, you know, or, or a kind of mini boom. You have, you know, there are signs of recovery, I should say from about the mid-nineties, but it's incredibly slow, incredibly slow, and as I said, hindered by, by the drought. People tended to refrain from spending. Investors were very reluctant to hand over their money when they looked at what had happened in the late 1880s and early 1890s. So the lack of a national government may well be significant in all this. Very, uh, if you like, disconnected and uncoordinated dealing with, with a depression. Um, however, let me move on to talk about the, that middle bit, really, the Federation era, because one thing that happens coming out of these disasters, these absolute disasters of the 1890s is major policy innovation, major policy innovation, and after 1900, of course, that's at the federal level, once the formation of a federal government, and federal parliament has been, um, Has occurred which of course from the first of January 19001. Um, one of the, um, Sort of factors sitting behind all this is the 1890s is also a period of enormous industrial disputation. The great strikes, as they're called, uh, begins really with a big strike in the maritime industry, so amongst workers on the waterfront and on the ships, but that becomes a general strike in 1890. Here's a kind of dramatisation of the confrontation. Uh, capital is often represented as Mr. Fat, and that's a, a long standing piece of iconography, you find that in cartoon after cartoon for many years. And there's our sturdy, um, male worker, uh, you know, confronting him, capital and labour issues, it's dramatising the confrontation that occurs in 1890 between, uh, striking workers and and and bosses. Um, the work is lost, OK, and that has a lot to do with the decline in the economy. It's much easier to recruit unemployed to take jobs of striking workers if you have a high unemployment rate, and that's exactly what happened in 1890. The unions lose that battle. They form a labour Party as a reaction to it, so the labour Party dates from the defeat of the strike the unions in the strike. Of 1890, the maritime strike, but that's followed by a series of strikes elsewhere. OK, 1891 in the Queensland wool industry, the shearers' strike of 1891, you know, it has a kind of legendary status. It was quite violent at times. Um, 1892, it's Broken Hill's turn, the western town, the outback town that I mentioned earlier, it has a major strike in 1892. Um, and, uh, again, the unions, the mining unions there are defeated. 1894, a second, even more violent, um, shearers' strike in eastern Australia, but particularly again in Queensland, also in New South Wales. Um, so a period of major conflict between capital and labour. The um argument that industrial disputes should be resolved by arbitration, you're familiar with that term, arbitration? Emerges really out of these strikes. There are kind of experiments going on in the 1880s for voluntary systems and all the rest of it, but the strikes of the first half of the 1890s managed to convince not merely labour movement, not merely union leaders, but also many liberals, like Alfred Deakin and Charles Kingston, the, the, the South Australian premier, that you needed to establish a court or, Wages boards or some kinds of tribunal to resolve industrial disputes, that these have been so bitter that they've been so divisive, they've been so damaging to the social fabric, to the economic fabric that you needed to bring the state in. But not government so much as a kind of legal, a a a judicial type system to deal with conflict between uh workers and bosses, and again this is the origins of a system that's kind of still with us but was central um that that arbitration system that's. System of centralised awards set out by courts and boards and tribunals which lasted really up until about the end of the 1980s, the beginning of the 1990s. It's a part of the the kind of what has been called, as I'll suggest in a moment, the Australian settlement. So that emerges from the strikes of the 1890s. It's supported by both labour and Liberal kind of figures. Um, Importantly, that the political context, as I've mentioned, the rise of the labour Party, we also have the emergence of other political parties in this period, um, Australia's democratic system and generally gotten by without political parties before you get to about the late 1880s, and in many ways it's a part of the economic decay and problems that I've been talking about, the parties emerge out of that. And critically, um, the basis for party organisation, leaving aside labour, I mean it obviously has a very specific set of concerns around the working class and unions and industry, but otherwise it's a tariff issue, it's the issue of free trade versus protection that becomes the basis of party organisation in New South Wales and eventually, Initially in the Commonwealth as well, so when the, the, the federation is formed in '91, there are three parties, labour and the other two are fiscally based parties. Free Trade Party, Free Trade liberals, and the protectionist Liberals. OK, so the kind of settlement that I'm talking about here comes out really of that party configuration, and the most common way in which Australia was governed in the early 20th century until 1909, Was with a liberal protectionist prime minister, Edmund Barton and later Alfred Deakin, supported by the labour Party. That's normally how Australia was governed up until 199. There were some periods of exception, so there was a period in 1945 where the Free Trade Party and some conservative protectionist governed. Without labour support, um, and that actually is the point at which the arbitration Act was passed. It had been a real governments, two governments had come and gone in trying to get an arbitration act through the federal parliament. It was highly controversial because labour, of course, wanted it to be all encompassing and they wanted it to um give preference to unionists and a whole range. Things like that and of course many liberals were very reluctant to do that or opposed to it. So governments tended to fall on the issue of arbitration. Eventually, ironically, it's passed by a relatively conservative free trade government. It's often the case, isn't it, that it's it's conservatives who often get those things through. It's called, what are they the phrase they use? Nixon to China, it's called, you know, the fact that. Um, recognition, US recognition of China comes from a Republican president, you know, more or less, uh, so that kind of idea, it's often conservatives who, who, you know, are sort of able to break through because, uh, they're seen as somehow more reliable, they, they're better able to go down the more moderate path or whatever kind of sent away. That's basically what happens with arbitration. Now once the court is established, its second president, not its first president, 2nd president was this man. Called Justice Higgins, HP Higgins, he was a radical liberal. In fact, he was attorney general in a labour ministry. There was a labour government that lasted about 4 months in 1904, uh, in Australia, led by a man called John Christian Watson. And of course there was no one on the labour side who felt sufficiently qualified to act as an attorney general, uh, so they asked him to do it and so he basically did the job of Attorney General, you know, that ministry, without joining the cabinet, you know, so he wasn't subject to cabinet discipline, but they basically got him to do the job. So he'd been a politician. Uh, in Victoria and then in the Commonwealth, he becomes a High Court judge and then his specialism becomes, uh, essentially as president of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Now this has very important implications, you've seen that picture because I showed it to you last night, I believe, and I showed it to you illustrating the ways in which the gold rushes generate, you know, um, Uh, an engineering industry and, uh, this was based at Ballarat originally, Sunshine Harvester, HV Mackay was the, the entrepreneur who did this. They eventually moved to what is now the Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, named after the company. Um, so, um, they, they produced this, this highly sophisticated, successful, uh, piece of machinery, sold well in Australia, they even managed to export it, but Mackay was a shocker of of an employer. I mean he was a really miserable character. Um, and eventually, um, uh, he's taken to the arbitration court. Now what, what happens is the federal government had come up with this concept and they called it new protection. This is under Alfred Deakin, OK, liberal protection as prime minister, supported by labour. They come up with this idea of new protection, and what new protection involves is essentially, there's obviously the tariff regime, OK, you've got a protective tariff. But you've also got an excise act. And basically the way this was supposed to work, it basically said to an an enterprise like this, a factory owner, it says, OK, we'll give you protection against the American product, the American imports, we'll put a tax on on the American imports, but we'll only do that, we'll only um allow that to happen. If you provide um a a fair and reasonable wage, OK, so the legislative regime essentially required, The employer to show that they paid a fair and reasonable wage or else they wouldn't get the tariff protection, and so the legislation was designed through a system of sort of rebates and so on to ensure that you would only get tariff protection against the imported product as an employer, if you paid a fair and reasonable wage, it linked protection for the manufacturer to protection for the worker in a very direct way. Problem? Any problems with that? Of course it was unconstitutional, and the High Court eventually struck it down in 1908. The Federal parliament is not empowered to regulate wages, OK, even today, it can't really regulate wages. OK, so it was eventually struck down, but by then the principle of a living wage had been established because in 197, It's fought out in the courts, it's fought out in the arbitration court, and Higgins sits down what has been called the harvester judgement as a part of that. Decision involving sunshine harvest, that's why it's called the harvester judgement, obviously. And he laid down that a living wage, you know, after investigation, witnesses, all the rest, I spoke to women about household budgets, for instance, a living wage should be 42 shillings a week, that's 6 days, so 6 times um uh 767 yeah, sorry, that's right, isn't it? Yeah, so 66 day week, 42 shillings a week was a laborer's wage, that's a fair it was considered a fair and reasonable wage to allow a labourer. To have a wife and 3 children, they calculated. Very arbitrary, but they thought that's a reasonable sized family in this period, many were bigger of course, um, and that was the living wage. And, and that is established as a concept that would be very influential in social policy for decades and decades afterwards. It became fairly generalised across the economy in the 1920s, so it took a while, but it's established in 1970. This is a fundamental foundational principle, if you like, of Australia's economic and social order. The concept of the living wage, a wage that was not just the minimum, Um, a wage that wasn't simply about capacity to pay, but a wage that would allow you to live as a civilised human being, as a, as a, an ordinary human being, a normal human being in a civilised society. There's a lot of the language that that Higgins uses is the language of civilization, what it means to live a civilised life in this society, so the living wage concept. Comes out of that in 1907, and even though the, the kind of legislative regime around it is invalidated by the High Court the following year, the principle is now in place, and so the court over a series of decisions, sets down refinements, if you like, of the living wage concept. You'll notice it is a masculinist family wage. This is, this uh, this is the male breadwinner system. It was not until the 1970s that the masculine aspect of this was abolished, and that women and men were basically given access to the same living wage or basic wage as it was then often called concept. It's, it's for men, and there there'd be refinements later, which I'll talk about in a later lecture that that specifically sought to exclude women from the male breadwinner wage. OK. So the term has been used by Frank Castles, a social policy scholar, the way Australia has, he says, a wage earner's welfare state, a wage earners welfare state. OK, and this is the idea that it's, it's, it's a welfare state, but it's centred on the concept of the of of the wage earner and particularly the male wage earner, the male breadwinner, and Paul Kelly, the journalist, has said, you know, well actually, We can talk about this as an Australian settlement that emerges in the early 20th century, and there are its various components, all of which I've talked about, I think, in one way or another. So white Australia, it's all based on racial exclusion. We've talked about protective tariffs. Australia adopts its first really protective tariff in 198, so at the time all this is happening with Higgins, it's basically being argued in the parliament, OK? So that's happening as background, sorry, there we go. So first protective tariff, 198, there was an earlier tariff regime, but it was set at a pretty low level. Arbitration, I've just talked about having a central court and of course there are equivalents in the states as well. So it wasn't just the Commonwealth one that they exist in the states, there's either courts or boards, all under the imperial umbrella and state paternalism, generally it's the idea that the state plays a central and important role. OK. Let me leave that there and just in the very last part, talk a little as I said very briefly about the First World War, which comes at the end of all this in 1914. And it's really important to keep in mind, we'll come back to World War 1 later in the course cause it, it bears comparison quite obviously with um Australia's experience of the Second World War, which was very, very different. If we did not remember the years 1914 to 18 or 114 to 19 as a war, we'd remember them as a depression because the Australian economy shrank. Now economies don't normally shrink. Economies will stagnate, they'll have low periods of growth. The Australian economy shrank between 1914 and 1920. Um, Australia funded its war effort in part by printing money. By printing money What happened OK, and they were able to do that, of course, because Britain went off the gold standard. One of the other things we would also remember 19 if we didn't remember 1914 as the outbreak of World War One, we'd remember it as one of the great financial panics of, of, you know, the last couple of 100 years, because that's what happened. The financial, the global financial system went into a meltdown, Britain went off the gold standard, um, so you know, that is. Pound sterling was not backed by gold, because they basically wanted to print money too, and so everyone's printing money to pay for the war effort and of course it is inflationary. It creates unemployment, it increases the cost of living, um, it and eventually. Provokes social and industrial conflict in Australia. There's an increase in strikes culminating in 1917 in a general strike in Australia, a bitter general strike that the government basically wins, governments and employers win. It involves government because it, it begins really as a a strike in the New South Wales tramways, um, so it's really begins as a a strike by government workers. But you can kind of see why World War 1 would also be problematic for Australia in other ways. Australia's a small country at this time, its population's what? Between 4 and 5 million or something by the time we get to this period. Now, if you send somewhere between 300 and 400,000 men, almost all men, in the prime of life out of the country. All of the demand that they generate is where? It's not in Australia, it's not, it's not, it's not stimulating any production, really not much anyway, a little bit, but not much. Most of the demand they're generating has been transferred to another hemisphere, either to Palestine or Gallipoli or or to Europe, to Britain. OK, you've taken a large, Um, component of demand, if you like, a large driver of demand out of the economy. You've also of course taken significant labour out of the economy too, and farmers in particular had difficulty attracting enough labour during especially the early period of the First World War, and of course they suffer another drought. There's a drought in Australia in 1914 to 1015. International trade is greatly disrupted, you know, for instance by submarine warfare. The dangers to shipping, cessation of trade with the enemy, so obviously trade with Germany and other enemy countries is banned, OK, that has a dislocating effect. And if you're an importer of German pianos in 1914, You're out of business. So what happened? Well, one of the things that happened, I'll talk about this next week, is that it actually helps to stimulate local production. OK, so toys, for instance, that would once have been uh imported from places like Germany have to be produced locally. Pianos gives a nice boost to local piano production, to take examples, but broadly speaking, this is a dislocating problematic war in terms of the Australian economy for the kinds of reasons I've been talking about. It is mitigated slightly, and I'll end on this note, it's mitigated slightly by the following. Billy Hughes is prime minister, and he's labour Prime Minister and then from 19, late 1916, early 1917, he's on the non-Labor side, there's a big split. labour is the government of Australia in the early part of the war, but it falls apart. If you want to know more, come and do Australian political history with me and the other course that I'm teaching at the moment. Um, but the point here about the economy is that Hughes is quite successful, Uh, in doing deals with the British to buy up goods that they often don't need. The whole wool clip, for instance. Now you might ask yourself, why the hell would any country buy from another country goods that they don't need. Indeed, it's even worse, goods that they couldn't even get their hands on because there was no shipping or lack of shipping to actually transport these goods from Australia to Britain. What's going on there? Why would you do that?

SPEAKER 2
If you're sending those soldiers to help with it.

SPEAKER 1
That's basically what's at the heart of it, but the British government knows that Australian solvency depends on its capacity to place its exports on the market, and the market basically means Britain for the most part. If Australia cannot sell its exports, it cannot contribute to the war effort.
