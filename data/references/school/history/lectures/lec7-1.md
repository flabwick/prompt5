SPEAKER 1
Yeah, um, we're looking more broadly at that, um, very extended period. Of economic growth and I think relative prosperity that occurred after the Second World War.

SPEAKER 2
So thank you so much. Right, it's a pleasure. It's great to be here. I'm conscious that there are a lot of words in these slides and I'm, I kind of want to move through a bit of content. I hope you can go back to them if there's anything that particularly interests you, because I, there's nothing more boring than a lecture reading through stuff that's on the slides. So they're there for reference and I hope you find them useful if you want to come back to them. OK, um, my last lecture, uh, with to you dealt with the economic policy challenges facing Australia at the end of the 19 at the end of the 1940s. The, the international dimension of the agenda for post-war reconstruction, and in that lecture I wanted to emphasise a couple of things. Firstly, the shifting contours of the international economy in which Australia found itself or needed to navigate its way into. That the sort of those old complementary ties to the United Kingdom, premised on protectionism, export of agriculture, import of highly manufactured goods, capacity for industrialization within those bounds, and the restrictions on consumption being tied to struggling economic and currency being replaced by the new world sketched by the United States. Promising a more open international economy, freer trade in industrial goods, much less so in agricultural products, investment in secondary production, but also control, dependence, and the export of profits. So with American investment in Australian industrialization in 50s and 60s, what you also got was American. and the export of American profits, but also clearly and central to your reading for this week, new opportunities for consumption that reflects that level of services growth and industrialization growth. In that lecture, that last lecture I was attempting to deal with what did this mean in terms of the wider world, Australia's place in the wider world, new markets, new prospects for development. And I suppose I was drawing out that it was a world of profound realignments. The focus of my lecture today is on the domestic dimension really of what came to be called the long economic boom, what in a sense was seeded in those post-war years that folded on arguably until the mid 1970s. Uh, I ended, I think, last week, last last years, my last leg. With this kind of graphic evocation of what in a sense was the political dimension that faced Australians by the time we get to the 1949 election. You've had a labour Party in power really associated with that ambitious post-war reconstruction agenda, centering, you read the white paper on full employment, on those kinds of concepts and that kind of intervention, um, being so closely associated with state control. So here you have the 1949 election being depicted as the the the the the the the the the roaring train of labour socialism breaking through the gates of public opinion, bugger it, we don't care what you want, you're gonna get planning. To the rather more sedate, urbane image of Menzies as the incoming Prime Minister luring the young, attractive female voter towards, and I don't think this is fair at all, Holden Holden labelled free enterprise because it wasn't a free enterprise car at all. Anyway, nonetheless, that's the kind of framework within which that 1949 election is being cast, a stark contrast. Between socialism versus capitalism, although I suppose I'd suggest to you that that phrase capitalism would not be much used at that time. They would tend to use, and you can see it in this kind of these advertisements here vote labour in 1943, homes for the people. There's a lot of contemporary relevance in the issues that I'm raising here as opposed to what the Liberal National Party is Country Party is offering in 1949. Where you see not so much capitalism but freedom, choice, individualism, control versus liberty, the ideologies or the values associated with economic systems rather than the economic systems in itself. Now I know you're a group of economic historians. You don't want to get political ideology forced down your throats, but I would argue that it is impossible. Most times, but particularly in this period, to understand economic choices without looking at the ideologies that drive them, and I suppose that is one point that I want to develop in today's lecture. That 1949 election was central to what would become the long endurance of the Liberal Country Party coalition. It's worthwhile just pausing to remind ourselves that party, those parties were in office from 1949 until 1972. And Robert Gordon Menzies was Prime Minister of Australia from 1949 until 1966. So that is one huge dominance of a political agenda, a remarkable image spanning a period of extended change. Uh, how do we characterise that relationship between that solid party political dominance and the economic change that is rolling through that period? Uh, the age of Menjies, there he is, huge eyebrows, neatly dressed. One image of Menzies had a great speaking voice, my parents would always and that was one of the things that was so characteristic of Menzies's dominance, the way in which he commanded a public platform. Uh, equally a figure so closely associated, going back to my last lecture, with an image of Australia really within the British Commonwealth. Lord Warden of the ports, so recognised, so loved by Britain that that's the kind of status that he really significant distinctively is accorded as a Commonwealth leader, and that's a really unkind image, but that's Menzies later in his life watching his face. Carlton football team from the front seat of a Rolls-Royce. Now he wasn't particularly well at the time, but nonetheless, it's an interesting contrast to the way in which the Prime Minister then might go and see the football, which is rather different to the way in which Albo might go and see the football now. It's a Bentley well, never mind, probably the rolls stayed in Canberra. Nonetheless, I'm trying to evoke an image. An image of what one political leader through that period looked like. It was a carefully crafted image. It began with a series of radio broadcasts, the forgotten people might be familiar to you in 1942. An attempt in 1942, labour is in power, Menzies has lost office or had to vacate office due to his unpopularity in 1941. Non-labor forces are looking for a new agenda given Menzies' failure as a political leader of the old united Australia policy and the sense that much that was associated with the fusion of Keynesian and social welfare agendas would not go away. So how would a new political movement, a non-Labor political movement, position itself in that framework? And Menzies, you know, beautiful speaking voice, sees the medium of radio to reach out to the Australian people and say, I'm offering you a new image. I'm offering you a new political alternative, all leading to the creation of the Liberal Party itself in 1944, very much accordance with Menzies' own designs, Menzies' own networks. It's his party. Uh, and you might be familiar with this again, lots of words there, I don't want to go through them all with you, but the forgotten people essentially are the middle class. The rich can look after themselves. The poor have, sorry, the working class have the labour Party and the labour movement, but in the middle, there is this group of Australians who are underrepresented and who are unacknowledged. And that Menzies would say is the core of the nation. I exclude at one end, the rich and the powerful who are able to protect themselves. I exclude at the other end the scale of the mass of unskilled people, almost invariably well organised and with their wages and conditions safeguarded by popular law, the union movement, the arbitration system. Those exclusions being made, who do I want to speak for? The kind of people I myself represent in parliament, salary earners, shopkeepers, skilled artisans, again, that sharp distinction, unskilled workers, skilled artisans, professional men and women, farmers and so on. These are in the political and economic sense, the middle class, they are for the most part unorganised and unselfconscious. I am going to give them a movement. We cannot exclude them from the problems of social progress, for one of the prime objects of modern social and political policy is to give them a proper measure of security and provide the conditions which will enable them to acquire skill and knowledge and individuality. But really crucially, and you will have seen this language pops up every now and again, certainly on the right wing of the Liberal Party, uh, quite frequently. I represent not the leaners, Ah, come on, where's the handout? I represent the lifters, those people who are prepared to take responsibility for themselves, who will look after their own interests, who are not prey, slaves to greed, fear, newspapers to public opinion. But again, this is typical Menzies rhetoric, landless smen sell the vapours of the street corner. They don't have property, they don't have possessions, they don't have an investment. They're just drifting. Landed men smell the brown earth and plant their feet upon it and know that it is good. Really powerful language, well, you might say surely people weren't sucked in by that, what does he mean by landed landless men? But this is a rhetoric that coming out of those years, firstly of deprivation in the 1920s and 1930s, then of planning in the 1940s, starts to look really serious, who's going to give me my land, my security, my home, my place of refuge and safety. OK. The political synthesis, so it's a remarkably successful image. The endurance of the Liberal Party in government, the fact that in a way that the Liberal Party still often goes back to this rhetoric. Um, what does it represent? The political synthesis Menzies represented, what were its central elements as they folded into an economic framework and the priorities of the next stage of the Australian national project. Arguably it's enduring, as I've said a couple of times, the Liberal Party still prides itself on its philosophy, in contrast to which the the ways in which the labour Party prides itself on its people. But again, here's a challenge for economic historians how do we fit the ideology and the economics together? OK, let's try and put a little bit of perspective on this. Even towards the end of the age of Menzies, that fit, Between ideology and economics or the lack of that fit was coming under scrutiny. The most famous, most often quoted intervention was actually towards the last years of Menzies actually being Prime Minister. It was Donald Horne's book The Lucky Country, a celebrated diagnosis, popularised but far from alone. Again, it might be familiar to you, it's worthwhile just reminding ourselves what Horne was arguing at the end or in the. Little really of the long economic boom, that period of prosperity that really spans from the late 1940s to the mid 1970s. So in the midst of that process, what is Australia? Well, we're a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people's ideas and although it's. People are adaptable. Most of its leaders in all fields, so lack curiosity about the events that surround them, that they are often taken by surprise, and no one exemplified this more for Horn than Menzies. It is imperial regalia presiding over a world that was so rapidly changing. Now there's a lot of this stuff, you know, people often say, oh Horn, he was a pathbreaker, not really. There's a lot of journalism at that time, some of it coordinated by Horn in magazines like The Observer, The Nation, a new form of journalism, a new form of current affairs reportage, the Financial Review is getting up into its stride. You have a really informed readership. Hall would call them the BA businessmen, the relatively well educated people who want really to know what is going on in society, who are the managers? What are we doing about productivity that are starting to ask questions about what does it mean to have economic rather than simply political interests in the future of the nation. So in the 1960s, these questions are already being raised. And then through the 1980s, Australians were being left in little doubt about how they should see the Australia of the long economic boom. Again, that span of unprecedented national prosperity, so defined by men. Now no doubt there's an element of political opportunism there, certainly for the Hawke government from 1983 onwards, but it's also a diagnosis, as your readings will suggest as you progress later in the course, that is picked up by a lot of economic commentators. That view, to put it bluntly, was one that included, as Dyer and Meredith put it in their um in their uh textbook. That was a period of some significant missed opportunities. We could have done so much better with the opportunities that were available to us in the long economic boom. There's no doubt about the gains of this period. As it's been summarised by one economic historian in the formulation that from 1940 to 1970, the Australian economy provided 80% more people, more than double the standard of living they had previously enjoyed. So at that objective level, right. But what are the relativities and what are the context? The verdict now is the transformation could have been so much more effectively managed to secure long-term sustainable goals in efficiency, productivity, competitiveness and integration, words that are familiar enough to your generation. How does Australia become a competitive international economy, but weren't really part of the vocabulary of economic commentators in this period, even within my own lifetime, and partly because of the kind of mastery of that guy in saying, come on you lot, grow up to what it means to be a sophisticated economy in a competitive world, those phrases mattered. After the election of the Hawke labour government, again I'm just trying to contextualise the period that we're looking at today. After the election of the Hawke labour government in 1983, the treasurer Paul Keating made high political theatre out of condemning the failures and complacency of Australian governments during those years when they could have capitalised on affluence and secured lasting prosperity. And of course you could argue, well, of course he would. The agenda of the Hawke-Keating government was precisely. About getting rid about getting rid of those things, those elements that were so central to economic policy in the long economic boom and protection, deregulate the economy, make the economy more competitive, privatise major public assets. This is the new agenda of the 1980s and it's anathema in all sorts of ways to that political contract which underpins so much of the popular discussion. But I'll qualify that shortly of the of the 19 1950s and 1960s and all coming under the remit of a labour government. The argument might be made, you might come back to this, uh, in your tutorial discussion of the Hawke Keating government. Everybody could see the need for change. It was crucial that a labour government pushed it through. Because at least the labour government could in a sense carry the workers, if I could put it bluntly, with them. No one's denying the need for change. The issue is partly why is there such resistance to change. Australia Keating argued had suffered from an awful cultural cringe under Menzies and again there's that emphasis not so much on the economics but on what values were people holding onto that meant that they couldn't see the glaring need for change. As Prime Minister Keatings put it, Sir Robert had held us back for nearly a generation. He had presided over, you've got the phrase there, uh, the golden age when Australia was injected with a near lethal dose of old fogism by conservative parties. When they put the country into neutral and we we gently ground to a halt in the nowhere land of the early 1980s. Menzies and his admirers, including successors in the John Howard led opposition government after 1996, belonged as Keating quipped to the quaint complacent age of the Astor TV, the AWA radiogram, and the Morphy Richards toaster, sharp, bitter edge to that old, quaint, nostalgic, longing for a past age. Well, again, in a way, I hope that's not too much of a digression, I just want to stop and pause for a moment at that language, because again, it's seen as a heroic reinvention. Let's get rid of that archaic past, captured in those brands. But let's just pause for a moment and think what those brands represented. They were all That's a AWA radiogram, that's an Astort television, that's a Morphy Richards toaster. They were all products of protected small scale manufacturing, inefficient, certainly, never export oriented, but they did provide jobs for Australian workers. And in many instances, they were largely Australian owned. And when challenged by competition, They went and the jobs of the workers who were made them went with them. AWA began producing radio electronics after its foundation in 1909, developing factories based in Homebush, Sydney. It became an icon Australian brand and a versatile business. Those of you who know Sydney landscape, Skyscape, there still is the AWA Tower. You could see it once, now you can't see it because it's dwarfed by a whole lot of corporate skyscrapers, but it's still there, I think, on Kent Street. It became a versatile business offering in particular rental schemes to people who could not yet afford to buy relatively expensive new technologies, radios, televisions. You don't have to buy them, you can't afford to buy them. We'll make them available to you on higher purchase. Until it was partnered by the UK based Thorne Electrical Industries in 1973, and by 1979 it had ceased all local production, its appliances being made much more effectively and cheaply by Mitsubishi in Japan. Gone. Astor Televisions was a brand of the South Melbourne-based Melbourne Electronics. It began production in anticipation of the introduction of television broadcasting into Australia relatively late in terms of the Western world in 1956. Australia came very late to the television age. And Astor Television's sponsored variety shows. The Astor Show in Melbourne, the Astor Showcase in Sydney, there are some images, um, in a valiant attempt to compete with, The equivalent US content, Australian television is full of American cheap content. Why don't we make our own? Now I put those up and you laugh, a bit quaint, bit silly, but this is Australian content and as store televisions partly because it's a way of increasing sales, is supporting local programming. But by 1970 that firm had been taken over by the Dutch-based Phillips Company, which dropped the brand name in 1979 and itself stopped local production of television. Morphy Richards had always been a British brand, but Imperial, the company had small sub subsidiaries in Australia, Canada, and South America. But it went through a radical makeover and division in the late 1950s in a tussle over whether it should begin to introduce new lines rather than staid old pop-up toasters and designs to cater for changing tastes, and it too ceased any local production not long after. So what's my point? Each of these icons, perhaps in unintended ways, were also part of Keating's swipe at the long economic boom. Those unsustainable local, heavily protected industries and insular national home brands that could not or would not adapt certainly looked heavy, dull and derivative when the world was full of change. But that was the AWF that was, I think it's the Astor factory at its height. That's its workforce at its height. That's what it looks like now. Eventually, with those icons went the jobs and skills of those who made them, perhaps the neighbourhoods those factories supported, and maybe even a little bit of what we might call national pride. So what was at stake in the long boom? This is not peculiar to Australia, it maps over major transitions in economic trends, indicators and relative performance, especially in Western economies. It, by extension corresponds readily to a significant division in prevailing paradigms in economic thinking and the characterization of the fit between economics, economic policy and government, the change of mind, as it has been termed, from a nation building Keynesianism to a market driven neoliberalism or monetarism at its end. One version of Keynesianism with its feet in the 1940s emphasised redistributed practises and state intervention. You had that in the white paper of full employment, recognising inherent imperfections in the market. Another form of Keynesianism more attuned to the 1950s and 1960s focused instead on countercyclical man management to ride through the inevitable fluctuations in the market. Keynesianism is not a monolithic phenomenon. Different people pick up elements of the. Tool kit and use them for different purposes. The Keynes and Keynesians of the 1940s were not the same as the Keynesians of the 1950s, and the debates between them are to some extent even more volatile in the 1950s and the 1960s than those in the 1940s. So economic thinking, even within the Keynesian orthodoxy is in itself changing, and it, by extension connects to other wider perhaps more diffuse patterns of political, cultural and social change, how Australians see themselves and their place in the world. And now for us all, as I've suggested, I just want to round up this point, uh, there is always the lesson. You can get it in blockbusters like Paul Kelly's uh, I've forgot the title. End of certainty or George Magainus' the Australian Moment. When he argues in 2012, our vulnerability came from a very simple understanding of what had fueled the golden age. We, like most rich nations, thought that government could still manipulate the economy through its own spending activities to secure full employment. The coalition thought it had enough tools at its disposal to fine-tune the economy, but the world was rapidly changing. Inflation was damaging relationships with nations within nations in between, to think that a few politicians working from their offices in the bush capital of Canberra could defend Australian interests against this new uncertainty was fanciful. That is just one of many popular influential characterizations of why the long economic boom unravelled. It's worth pausing at again just for a minute, not the polarity. The foolishness of government, remote from the real world, in assuming it could achieve an overarching objective, full employment, when that pursuit only fostered inflationary tendencies in the economy which damaged other relationships, the appropriate networks between people determined by the discipline of uncertainty, risk, competition. It's a diagnosis, but it's also a way of characterising a choice and the interests it reflects. It should not be taken as a given, as self-evident, without some closer exploration. So what might some elements of that closer exploration be? The wider context, again, the international dimensions are significant. With deep reservations, the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbaum in his major study of the 20th century refers to the decades we are discussing today as the golden years. Megalogenis uses golden age. And Hobsbawm's argument is that in a little over 2 decades following World War 2, we in which we there are, there were a little over 2 decades following World War 2 in which with whatever level of continuing and profound inequality between the circumstances of people around the world, nonetheless, Hobsbam, and again he's a Marxist, so he doesn't quite like saying this, but he has to admit. A single increasingly integrated and universal world economy delivered sustained increases in life expectancy, improvements in the basic conditions of life, a quadrupling of manufacturing outputs, and perhaps more in agricultural production, exponential increases. Exponential increases in the availability of energy and mobility with environmental consequences and inconceivable transformation, the technological possibilities of modern life, the list could go on again for all of those who had access to what the post-World War world looked like. Some historians or some people have referred to this as the great acceleration. And you probably can't see that in any great detail, but these are profiles of all of these socioeconomic trends, all systems trends. This point here is 1950. And you will note that a kind of a universal phenomenon, these are global figures of those that comes out in those tables, is that something fairly fundamental, something exponential starts happening to the world, it's access to resources, it's use of resources, and the changes that those resources make possible around about 1950. Some of the elements might be termed you can look at in world population. Numbers, mobility. Some might be in primary energy use. All of a sudden we've got access to cheap fuel, at least we will until 1973. Or urban population, the number of people who are moving into cities, what do people do when they move into cities? Well, they start to consume a little bit more or they stimulate consumption simply by the fact that they're moving into cities, no longer in a sense being able to kind of feed themselves. But produce surplus product for other people to buy and so on and so on. Now I'm not going to spend any more time on those figures, but they are powerful. They do suggest that the world is changing fundamentally in the period that we're looking at. So what does Australia's experience of that change look like? If those are the aggregate figures for the world, what choices, You've got Greg Whitwell's reading, I think for this week, Suburban Imperative, where he says there are a series of choices that Australians are making in the 1950s about what they are going to do with their slice of this cake. What choices do Australians make? Well, the trends are clear, uh, and again, I'm stealing a lot of this from Whitwell. Um, this is just a profile in GDP 1966, 1967 prices really through that period from relative prosperity on the eve of the First World War. A marked dip in the 20s and 30s. We don't really get back to 1914 levels until 1939, but then look at what happens. This is Australia, so these are Australian figures. So by the time we get to 1971, we've got twice the figure of 1947, more than 2.5 times that of 1933. So here in aggregate GDP some kind of acceleration is going on. You can see this in other areas as well, transformations in the profile or the structure of the economy, uh, rural industries steadily declining. I know David spoke to you about mining yesterday, I think the important point is mining comes late. In what we identify as the long economic boom, and I probably, I probably run out of time to talk about this, but mining isn't, yeah, mining in a sense defines the, what comes out of the long economic boom rather than what sustains it. Manufacturing is the interesting one to look at again, it's those ATA televisions. And it's the AWA radios, there's a big surge in the 1950s, kind of carried on through into the 1960s, then we start to taper off. Because then in a sense we can get it cheaper from overseas. Services, of course, is really interesting. What are we buying in, what do we want, what are we spending our money on? Uh, and you can relate this to population growth. Again, that point I made earlier on. Australia's population spoke about immigration in an earlier lecture. Australia's population is growing really fast during this period. It's stimulating part of this productivity. Why are we bringing people in? OK, the first incentive might have been populate or perish or get invaded. But increasingly immigration is being identified as a long term investment in increasing productivity. And to some extent it's been reflected in those skills. So what we're looking at is undoubted affluence. One of the popular, there's a building named after him, like so many influential economists of this period, a lot of these economists writing through the 50s and 60s were based at the ANU. Uh, in 1980, 1968, Heinza published a really influential collection of essays called A Small, Rich Industrial Country. That was how Art described Australia in 1968, and I think, you know, historically there's something really arresting about that, particularly you probably can't read it, but he goes on to suggest, who are we like? Well, we're kind of a bit like Sweden, and we're a bit like the Netherlands. We're a bit like middle ranking industrialising European economies. No one would have described Australia as a small, rich industrial economy in the 1920s or the 1930s. Arguably, they wouldn't describe Australia as a small rich industrial country now. They certainly wouldn't look at these kinds of comparisons. Who are we like? But in the 1960s, you could think about Australia like this. Those of you who are doing international relations, that idea of a middle ranking power. And the particular capacities that a middle ranking power can exert in an international system. Same kind of thing is going on in economics. OK, we mightn't have muscle, but we've got brains, we've got skills, we've got investment, we can exert influence. And the, you know, again, these tables I think are from some uh taken from uh the claim. You can see, and I think I've shown you, you, you can see how this period of the post-war economic boom is a remarkably sustained period. Of high achievement. Over a sustained period. Now, how might we characterise this? The heroic interpretation would be, well this is Keynesian countercyclical economics, macroeconomics at work. We ride out the fluctuations. Ian McLean would come back and say, no, look, we don't need to call it Keynesian, we just need to call it clever policy adjustment to changing circumstances. Any government within, with any kind of smarts within this situation would have done much the same. That's a debate for you to have, except to some extent it's not that simple because it takes a while for Australian economic managers to get a clear sense of what they needed to do. The first shock was the Korean War boom in 1950-951. I'm really running out of time, so I'll just do this very, very quickly. It's kind of really simple. The Korean War breaks out. The United States needs lots of wool for uniforms for soldiers because they don't know whether this is the beginning of World War II, and if it is, Korea gets damn cold in the winter. So we need to buy up all, and they insisted on buying up all of the excess of Australian wool stocks. Wonderful. Graziers get a great deal of money, suddenly in their pockets, the price of wool goes up by 250% within a couple of weeks. Graziers, I had an uncle who was one of them, bought a Mercedes on this, um, never got rid of it, uh. What do farmers do with the money, that's they spend it. What do they spend it on? Imports. Mercedes, balance of payments trouble. What do they also do? Well, they force up costs. We still are in an economy where wages are partly being driven by inflation. So if inflation goes up, then unions start saying, look mate, prices are going up, you've gotta do the same for my wages. So wages start going up, you start getting into a highly orchestrated inflationary spiral. What is the government going to do about it? Well, we need to stop it. So let's all of a sudden clamp down on money availability, access to credit, let's pull back the budget. No, well, the public service was told to cut 9000 jobs in a, in a work office sounds familiar really, doesn't it? In a workforce in Canberra at that time, I think at 40,000. All of a sudden pulled back, what you get is a recession. Because you can't get the timing right. now Fadden as treasurer is saying, look, this is Keynesian economics, when it's going well, you pull back, when it's going bad, you pump in. But there are always lags in economic investment. There are always lags in macroeconomic management. So the Korean War boom was just one indication that it's really hard to pick the moment. But nonetheless, Keynesianism does reign supreme. Uh, this is, seems like a bit of a cruel joke. If you want to go to the University of Melbourne to the commerce school, you can see this thing, which is a hydraulic machine built out of ex-Second World War aeroplane parts that was used to teach macroeconomics at the University of Melbourne. It essentially is a hydraulic system with a series of levers and valves that you use to regulate the flow of coloured water. So when you've got a little bit of pressure building up here, you syphon off that water to direct it somewhere else. Go look at it. This is, you know, a cheat sheet from learning Keynesian economics at the University of Melbourne at this time. It's how do we manage a macroeconomic system? You just have to get the balances right. As Frank said, I've got a particular interest in this bloke because I wrote. A biography about him once, but he was one of the gurus of teaching, you know, Keynesian macroeconomics to Australia. His argument was our role as an economists, as economists is to regulate how much money people have to spend. You and we will adapt. Uh, this is precisely what we're trained to do to identify what it is we have to give up together and how much in order to get a little more of something else that we want to present the facts to the people and to lead them to choose what they want. We're like psychiatrists. We have to manage your mentality, we have to manage your spending through budget and taxation processes. That's a really rude summary of Keynesian economics and and macro, but, but this is the kind of mindset within which a government is working. How do we manage the choices that people are making to achieve stability? And again, you could argue if you go back to those tables, I won't go back to them, but from 1950 through to the 1960s, we've got stability. So you could say, well, you know, government's doing its job. When things are getting a bit overheated, we pull back. When things need a bit more stimulus, we push in. But relatively, Australia's slipping. Uh, real, and as you can see from this table in comparison to the OECD, we're doing well in ourselves, great, but this is not the first time we saw it in the second half of the 19th century, didn't we? Wow, really affluent society. We're at the top of our game, top of the world. We continue being affluent, but look what's happening to Germany. Look what's happening to the United States. We're slowly starting to fall. Why? What choices are we making? Well, this I suppose is where wet worlds, the suburban imperative comes in. Where are we putting our money? What are we choosing to buy? And you could say these are all perfectly legitimate choices. To buy a house. Not to rent a house. What else? To fill the house with a range of appliances, well, you know, we've got all these American commodities and these American soap operas telling us what it should be like to live in a modern affluent house. So this is what we need and we why we need a car. We need a car because we're living in suburbs, it's not so much that we want a car, or of course we want a car, but we need a car to get to work, to get the kids to school. Because our cities, again, remember that graph on urbanisation are growing. So we see these as choices. The crucial phrase for Woodwe's book is the imperative. You see them as choices, but to what extent do you actually have a choice when these issues are being structured for you in this way and without being cheap, we could bring in Bob Menzies again and say, what are we doing? Landless men smell the vapours of the street corner, landed men plant their feet upon the brown earth and know that it is good. The best Australian citizen owns their own home. That is your birthright. Familia Do you want your own home? Yeah, of course you do, but within what economic settings? OK, let's pull back. There is, I would suggest, a pattern of public policy that's, that takes that is starting to take shape in Australia through this period. Um, And it's Exemplified by a really great book, it's a bit dense, um, but government and capitalism, old book by Butlin Barnard and Pinches, where their argument is that what we see in the 50s and 60s, Is a policy choice that Australian governments are making to support private choice, to subsidise private choice, your capacity to make your own decisions, Rather than for the public to provide those services. So, school retention rates are appalling in Australia coming out of the Second World War. an earlier lecture I showed you how few people are actually going to university. Well, partly that's because very few people are actually finishing not just year 12, but their intermediate exams. So what are we going to do to start getting kids into school? Well, you could say we're going to put a lot of money into public schools, but the policy choice that the Menzies government makes is, well, actually what we might do is start offering rebates to people who send their children to private schools. Or rebates to people who choose to invest in textbooks for their kids going to school, so the schools won't actually provide the textbooks because we want you to be responsible, we want you to take charge of your own child. So we'll use the taxation system, you'll submit your receipts and we'll give you a rebate. We'll do the same in health. Health, public health, the concept of public health, again I think I spoke about this in the post-war reconstruction lecture, was a real priority. What are we going to do to invest in public health? Doctors get really upset about that because it stands on their professional toes. Remember the forgotten people, one of Menzies forgotten people, are the professionals who want to be left alone. So doctors are saying, don't you conscript us into public health. You start providing a system of private health insurance. That will be subsidised by the government, so you take out, uh, private healthcare, we'll subsidise you for doing that, we want to give you public health. We'll subsidise your choice of private health. Now that, because we want you to take responsibility for your own provision. This, again, I'm rushing through this, but this is such a pattern. Repeated over and over again through public policy choices that are made in this period and you could say ide ideologically, well yes, it makes sense, we want to encourage incentive. But who's incentives? Who has access to that little bit of extra money that they're going to put into buying their son or their daughter the better textbook. So that they can get the tax deduction at the end of the financial year. It's most marked again in a kind of a topical way in the renegotiation of the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. Now you might remember in 1945, the principle behind the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement is that the government would build houses for rental, the rental rates of which would be kept at a level. Commenssurate with your income, so no one would pay above a certain percentage of their income to rent a com a publicly built house. What the Menzies government progressively does culminating in 1956, is rewrite the terms of the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement to say we will either build homes that we will then sell to you. Using your rent as down payments on owning the property or upfront if you've got the money. We're not in the business. A socialising housing. We're in the business of rewarding the incentive of those who are prepared to pay for their own home. So by the time you get to 1956, the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement is about, and again this will sound topical, maybe you think this is right. It's about assisting people into private home ownership. Rather than regulating the the the rents that people should pay for publicly provided housing. And that's not just an economic decision, that is a decision that reflects the changing social status of housing. I own my own home, so I'm a better person. I rent, so I'm a leaner. And it just rolls through the system in all sorts of ways. I don't have time to go into this again, partly what is driving this uh I've already given this table in immigration rates. We are seeing in this period a huge shift not only in who, how many Australians, new Australians are coming, but also where they're coming from. Look at the shifting indicators. We can't get enough from the United Kingdom, so where are we going to go? Well, we might have to go to Greece or we might have to go to the Netherlands. By the time you get to the 1960s, it's even more pronounced in terms of where these people are coming from, and they're coming as I suggested in an earlier lecture, some of them are coming as cheap labour, increasingly they're coming as highly skilled labour because we've got jobs for them to do. Where are those jobs? Well, they might be in towns like, Elizabeth, which was purpose built in South Australia to build, Motor cars, General Motors Holden, purpose-built, beautifully designed town, state housing commission, there is the house for rent again, exemplifies the model, uh build the cars, bring out a lot of British workers, it's a place to grow. Any of you who know, and you know, there is Elizabeth herself, opening, it looks like Canberra, was modelled on Canberra, opening up Elizabeth. Any of you who know Elizabeth now, any of you that's from South Australia, any of you who've ever listened to Jimmy Barnes, who is a product of exactly that kind of skilled tradesmen brought out from Britain to build motor cars, but then the factory closes, they're closing down our town. So It's not that these issues are not being discussed at this time. There is an increasing critique of what are the priorities that are being observed in economic development, not just in Australia but in most Western countries.
