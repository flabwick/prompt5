actually did that before and turned it back on, nothing. Very, very sorry about the situation. I'm But I OK.

SPEAKER 0
Uh like this Go Sell on what the hell.

SPEAKER 1
So this would have been working all day and then it's just. manually override. Uh, we'll get there. Oh, I'm gonna get a start. OK, hold on one second. The docking camera just turned on. Did it come up here? Yeah. But the PC is not. it's all Testing 12. Good, right, here's a start to the semester, hey? Oh, it's working great, OK. Good. Uh, and the cables down here, isn't it? OK, great, thank you, thank you very much. And is that that's the proper port for it, that one where I've got that USB that's terrific thanks. Is there anything I need to know for this time or is it just, well thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thanks for helping me. And 12, this one's working as well now. Right, OK I OK, good.

SPEAKER 0
OK. I think you, I think you have a space that

SPEAKER 1
you gotta do. Oh, you're right. That's what happens when you get old. Thank you. I was just reflecting that I used to teach in this class 31 years ago in my first job at this university. Um, let this be a lesson to you. You should move on rather than sort of, I think Paul Keating, we might as well quote the famous treasurer, his phrase, like a dog returning to its vomit, is the phrase, but I'm sure that we'll have great fun. Um, now, let me just Yes, I was very young when I started, I know, yeah, um. There we go. Oh, beauty, look, we're almost there, maybe. OK, oh yeah, no, we don't need all that. Slideshow, tell me it's showing up behind me, is it? Oh jeez, fantastic. Um, great, alright, we're there. I feel vindicated cos normally when things go wrong like that, it's me, but it's not me, it was it apparently, um, oh well, that was me, I imagine. Right, OK, um, so, uh. I'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet and then all and pay my respects to their elders, past, present, and emerging. Um, so I'm Frank Bongiorno and I'm your convenor, coordinator for the course, um, so welcome. uh, if you're not here for the Australian economy, past and present, you are in the wrong lecture theatre, um. But assuming you are, welcome to the course. Uh, I'm doing most, but not all the lectures. We do have guest lecturers coming in from time to time. In fact, we have a guest lecturer, um, at our very next lecture, which is tomorrow, um, over in, in Law theatre, uh, uh, Boyd Hunter, whose work you're also reading, um, for, uh, the first tutorial. So, um, you won't have to suffer me every week, uh, but, uh, I am giving most of them. Um, so, uh, all I'm going to do today is very much kind of overview. I'm happy to field any queries that you have about administrative issues, um, but of course there'll be opportunities to do that both here and in tutorials as we go forward. Are there any preliminary issues that anyone wanted to raise or problems they run into at this stage that I can deal with? OK, everyone's happy at the moment. Good, terrific. Um, who here's a first year student, who's coming to the university for the first time? Welcome to ANU as well. Um, you, you know, maybe you'll be here in 31 years as well, I don't know. Um, but anyway, uh, so welcome, welcome to the ANU. The course tends to sort of be a bit of a mixture really of, of first year students and sometimes students, uh, who are in later years coming back to do a, a 1000 level course. Um, so, let me give you that, that overview, um, today as I work through that. So why Australian economic history, you are wondering. Um, I'm assuming most of you are not doing a garden variety bachelor of Arts. Would that be a fair comment? Are there any BA students here? Oh well, that's pretty good. But the rest of you are probably doing other things, um, and so I've tended to pitch this as, you know, why an economic history course within studies that are probably directed towards things like economics or commerce or whatever, and, and that's really, I suppose, what I kind of have in mind today. So let me go forward. Um, economics in many ways is, is, um, a kind of interdisciplinary field. Um, it can bring, uh, in philosophy, uh, all of you who are doing, uh, economics, uh, as, uh, I suspect several of you are, will know that, uh, um, modern economics obviously often has a strong mathematical base, plenty of equations in there. Uh, Psychology has become, I think, increasingly, uh, and explicitly important in the study of economics in, uh, recent decades, uh, political science, sometimes when political science and economy are paired, particularly, uh, within a kind of Marxist tradition, it's called political economy. Um, and history, and that's really, uh, where we're coming from in this course. I'm a historian, I'm not an economist. Most I think of those who are coming in to lecture would also be historians rather than economists, although not Bod actually. So some, some, um, some of us are, are basically coming at this from a historical point of view, others from an economics point of view. But history is also a discipline that borrows from other disciplines. Um, it, it's a study of the past, but, um, you'll all be familiar with, you know, terms like political history, social history, cultural history. Inevitably, uh, in, you know, uh, the study of history, you tend to draw on other disciplines. I mean, much of my work has been in, uh, political history, and inevitably, I tend to draw on political science or political studies in the work that I, I do. Um, so, um, history has that much in common with economics that it, it draws on, on other disciplines depending on what kind of history it is. So, cultural history very often, uh, relies on anthropology to take a, a, a particular example. So, um, One of the things we're trying to do, I guess, in a course such as this one, is to confound your understandings of disciplines of self-contained bodies of knowledge. Um, they, they're never self-contained, they're they're they're sort of permeable, um, but they always have, uh, other influences that shape the ways in which those inquiries proceed, and that's dynamic too, it shifts over time. OK, so why history? Why might history be useful or valuable in a study of an economy? OK, now, you know, a lot of the economic studies that you would do, macroeconomics, microeconomics will probably lack a strong historical base, um, but you'll get economists to admit, uh, over in CBE or the Research School of Economics, that, Um, what they call economic theory inevitably depends on an analysis of history, OK, it draws on, Uh, particular readings or understandings, interpretations of the past and so economics and history, I think are very much uh natural bedfellows. So let let me give you an example of how we can use history and understanding economies better, explaining, say the present shape of the economy as a product, as I've said there of long running historical processes. OK, the, the nature of the Australian economy today is very different from 30 years ago. I mentioned when I first lectured in this, in this room. It's, it's very different indeed from, uh, 60 and 70 years ago when Australia was a more industrialised society, where manufacturing, for instance, was a greater component of the workforce, a greater share of gross domestic product, a greater share of the overall economy, and so on. A good example I think is mining. I think mining dramatises, this is obviously a very important part of the modern Australian economy uh in a range of ways, it's been central, Uh, to, I think Australia's economic prosperity of the last 25, you could argue the last 60 years really, I mean, iron ore mining in this country took off in the early 60s. It now forms, uh, minerals form the largest component of the export economy. Now that, that wasn't true um in my lifetime. In the 1970s, uh Australia's the, the most lucrative export was still wool. I think coal overtook wool as the most valuable export at the end of the 1970s, so that has changed in my lifetime. The importance of education as an export, effectively an export industry has also shifted and become greater. Tourism has become greater across that period. Um, but mining has certainly um uh increased dramatically, uh, in, you know, the last several decades. Um, what does a historical approach, um, do for us in, in, in, in trying to untangle that? Well, are there precedents? The answer of course is yes there are, because Australia has had, I mean, coal mining, as I'll talk about later in the course going back to uh the 1790s, so a very long time ago in the European history of this country. Um, but you know, metal mining going back to at least, uh, again I'm talking about the European history or the British history of the country, from the 1840s onwards when copper mining began in South Australia. And then of course from the 1850s onwards, the gold rushes in Victoria, in, in New South Wales, for about 20 years between 1850 and 1870, gold overtook wool as the most important, most valuable export. OK, so there were precedents for the importance of mining. Exploring the impacts of of metal mining in those early periods can be useful in understanding the ways in which mining operates on the economy today. Um, there were other periods where, um, uh, you know, mining has been rather important. I'm talking primarily of, of, of metal mining, um, a period around the sort of late 19th century, uh, the, the increasing importance of gold mining in Australia has often had an inverse relationship to the overall health of the economy. So when the economy's going bad, Um, there is usually a trend towards, um, the, the discovery of new gold fields and, and an increase in gold production. This happened in the 1890s, a period of depression, it happened again in the 1930s, a period of depression. So, um, that's one of the explanations behind the increasing importance of mining at the end of the 19th century, the end of the 1800s. A new period of metal mining, a new resurgence of mining, the 1960s to the 1980s, 1 of the things you'll learn later in this course, Australia had an effect of prohibition on the export of iron ore between 1938 and 1960. Now you think of how important iron ore exports are to the economy today. There was a period there of what, whatever that is, 20 odd years, a bit over 20 years, where iron ore exports were effectively prohibited. Now you might wonder why, well, because Australia was believed to have only very limited reserves of iron ore during that period, and of course iron ore was a strategic product in a context of war and and war seemed um, You know, almost inevitable by the end of the 1930s, so, you know, you had a period there where um there were virtually no iron ore exports, all the iron ore in the country was being used in Australian steel production, OK, for local production, and then of course that embargo is lifted at the beginning of the 1960s. And, well, you know where we are today and have been in recent decades in relation to that particular export. You cannot understand that process unless you actually look at the history, OK? It's not that, you know, the iron ore sort of sits there in the ground waiting for someone to come along, and they come along and then they export and then it's important all of a sudden, and eventually it overtakes things like wool and wheat or whatever. It doesn't happen like that. The iron ore embargo. It was a decision of government, the decision to lift it at the beginning of the 60s was as a result of lobbying by mining industry, by state governments, particularly the government of Western Australia and the federal government, was open to that because it appeared that there, that in fact iron ore was much more plentiful than it had seemed back in the 1930s, the discovery of new fields and so on. Um, also, we tend to think of, again, looking at mining and metal mining, we tend to think of it as a source of kind of unending wealth. I mean, that's been a common view that the title of Geoffrey Blainey's History of metal mining in Australia, written back in the early 1960s at the time it was taking off again, 1963 in fact. The rush that never ended, the rush that never ended, so this this idea that, you know, you have a kind of gold rush in the 1850s and, you know, a, a series of waves, um, and, and, you know, he obviously wants to show a broad continuity in the history of mining in Australia, but in fact, you know, mining isn't um a a a kind of pure good. Uh, it, it can have major uh drawbacks, it can actually damage economies in certain instances, it can damage polities as well. Political systems can suffer under the impact of mining in certain kinds of circumstances. Have you come across the term the resource curse? Is that a, a, a, a term you're familiar with? So, you know, a a a country um such as, uh, Congo, for instance. In Africa is a good example, incredibly rich in, in, in minerals, uh, but you know, major problems in terms of political stability and corruption over the years. Uh, the, the richness of its its mineral endowment has not actually brought about, you know, things like political stability and economic affluence. Now, that often has to do with the interaction of resources, uh, such as, uh, well, mining mineral resources with other. Parts of the economy with the institutions in that society, are they, you know, strong political institutions that can withstand, um, uh, you know, you know, corruption, the problems of corruption or forceful lobbying, uh, foreign interference, and, and, and, and, you know, foreign lobbying of governments and a whole range of things such as that. So, you know, the term resource curse has often been used for that particular problem. Uh, a very highly developed mining sector can suck resources and labour from other parts of the economy, and in fact the Australian economy has has suffered these kinds of problems. Um, one of the, the difficulties that the Australian economy experienced earlier this century was that the, the, the thirst for labour and investment in the mining sector, which was very lucrative, of course, was tending to starve areas such as manufacturing and, and, and also. was pushing up the value of the Australian dollar dollar which was making it harder for manufacturers of cars, for instance, to, to be able to export, or you know, manufacturers more generally to be able to, to, to export or even to place their products on the local market at a, a price that would be competitive. OK, so, um, the Dutch disease, I hope there's no, no one here from the Netherlands, uh, that will be offended, but the other term is, um, for this is, is Dutch disease. And and again it comes out of a history. Of of that economy. So, um, other, you know, other issues around mining, it's a finite resource. In the end, uh, mines bottom out. OK, you're not dealing with a a resource that's necessarily endless. Um, the social and environmental impacts of mining, OK, can be very negative, OK? And, and we, we know this particularly in the developing world, where corporations often come in and aren't too, uh, you know, uh, choosy. If you like, about how they go about their business. They often go about their business in a way that um creates significant social dislocation can damage the environment, and they lead to cleaning up to to to others, to governments, to communities and some Australian companies have been guilty of this, some Australian companies at this very moment are um subject to litigation in other countries because of these sorts of issues, um, safety issues as well, of course, which, I guess we can, we can also put in in in that sort of situation or that sort of a category. Um, fluctuating international prices, busts tend to follow booms and, um, you know, this has been a characteristic of dependence on, on, on mining, and uh, Uh, you know, you can go out into the Australian hinterland and you'll find ghost towns, which are, are basically the remnants of perhaps a gold rush or a tin rush or whatever from earlier periods in Australian history. Some of you've probably been through the the snowy mountains and I think it's gone now, I think it was destroyed in the the fires of of 2019, 2020, but a town like um Kyandra, which, which would have had thousands of people and, Uh, you know, you go past it or used to go past it, and, uh, you, you essentially had, you know, a few old dilapidated historic buildings that were sort of hanging on through heritage preservation and, uh, um, I haven't been up there in recent years, but as I said, I think they were actually, uh, virtually destroyed in the the bushfires a few years ago. So, you know, the ghost town is, is a good example of, of, um, You know, that, that, you know, it's a reminder that, that, um, you know, uh, a mining boom will often be followed by a bust. And of course, um, this also, mining exposes a particular economy to the vagaries of an international market. One of the attractions of higher levels of industrialization for many countries in the 20th century was that manufactured products tended. To attract more stable prices. So if you could, you know, export, uh, manufactured products such as Italy does that has done so successfully over the years, um, you were less subject to the vagaries of the market than if you're trying to place your copper or your, you know, gold or or coal or whatever it is on the iron ore on the international market. OK, um, Historians, um, and. I guess scholars using historical or historically based methods also have a series of intellectual tools that can be really helpful in understanding how economies develop. And one of those that I'll refer to, and I suspect other lecturers too will refer to during the course, is the concept of path dependency. Have you encountered that concept before? Do you know what path dependency is? So it comes out of a body of theory, which you don't need to worry terribly much about called historical institutionalism, historical institutionalism. And what path dependency is, it's basically the concept that, At any particular moment in historical time. The options available for development are limited, that is, that we're all subject to choices that have been made in the past. We're all subject to choices that have been made in the past, and that means that at any particular moment we don't have infinite choice about what we can do. We have a more limited choice about what we can do, and this is really how economies tend to operate. They can't operate, or they can't shift rapidly from one focus to another because someone basically comes up with the idea we can make more money out of, you know, uh, manufacturing, uh, televisions that we can make out of, Exporting wheat, OK, your economy, the choices that a policymaker or a business can make in any set of circumstances are limited by the choices that have been made in the past. And I'm sure you could, if you thought about it, you could think of a whole range of ways in which, um, The Policy choices in society in Australia today have kind of been shaped by the past. A good example actually in, you know, Australian policy would be something like funding of schools. OK, funding, funding of schools. So when a government comes in, it'll often, you know, particularly, I suppose, uh, you know, a labour government coming in 3 years ago federally, it'll it'll say things like, you know, we need to shift the balance of resources to schools that are most in need, which will, you know, the public schools, the state schools that are most in need, and, you know, away from wealthy private schools. And I'll come in with these. Sorts of policies and, you know, there's a Gonski review and all the rest of it. There'll be, you know, inquiries and and new formulas and all the rest of it. But in reality, when a government comes in, it's also subject to choices that governments in the past have made about how to fund schools. OK, no government is gonna come in and shift vast resources from point A to point B, simply because they told electors that it'd be a good idea to move in that direction. OK, any government is going to be subject to the choices of the past. Now, one of the criticisms that has been made of this concept is, so how do things ever change? How do things ever change? Well, they do change, and one of the other tools that has been developed is the notion of a critical juncture. That is, there'll be certain moments in historical time where things open up, where where new possibilities tend to open up for a range of complex reasons that historians are in a very good position to explore. OK, and I'll be suggesting to you during the course, in fact, I'll probably mention it briefly today, that there have been particular moments in Australia's history. That we can call critical junctures where shifts have occurred as as a result of that kind of um opening up that I'm talking about there, OK, where, choice is just a little bit less constrained, and it's often a very gradual process, it's not often, not always recognisable, easily recognisable at the time it's occurring, but you can look back on it and say, yeah, that was a critical juncture where there was a shift from one place to another. Um, let me give it another, I'll talk about another example here around this concept of path dependency in particular, and that's manufacturing. Now, what's the government's policy again, I can never remember, make something and what's it called? The government has some slogan. That's the one, Made in Australia they say, Made in Australia. OK, so this is all about, you know, increasing Australia's industrial capacity, we're gonna make things here. We're not gonna send raw materials overseas, uh, and, and, uh, and simply have them sent back to us as finished products, um, we're, we're gonna make it here and so on. Now, um, I, I don't, I don't have in my head at the moment, uh, what percentage of the economy, uh, belongs to manufacturing in Australia today. I'd say what, maybe 6 or 7%, it's very, very low. OK, so turning that around is very difficult, uh, and, and calf dependency kicks in here, of course. Australia clearly has all sorts of, it's called comparative advantage by economists around the export of largely unprocessed materials, whether it's iron ore, coal, whatever it happens to be. So, basically the government deciding, oh, we're gonna prioritise manufacturing, yes they can. Influence things, um, they can influence things. Think of the role of defence contracts. They can influence things, but they can only influence things again with that within that sort of limited sort of, um, domain that I was talking about for for decision making. So, but manufacturing is a great example I think of the interaction of different factors in an economy, because, Manufacturing industry was seen as the basis for a modern, a properly modern society in the 19th and 20th century. If you wanted a country that would be able to defend itself in a war, if you wanted a country that would be protected from radical fluctuations in the prices of, of raw commodities, uh, if you wanted to be able to build your population up. Um, you needed industry to do it, you needed manufacturing to do it. If you wanted a high standard of living, you would need to develop your manufacturing industry, that you wouldn't be able to build a high standard of living simply on the back of sheep or wheat or whatever. Apart from anything else, it would, it simply would not be able to employ enough people. Something like the wool industry is not particularly labour intensive, OK, to take an example. So what you get is you get government policy right through, you could argue from about the 1860s onwards, through to about the 1990s, that was designed to promote industrialization, that was designed to actually help along manufacturing. Because it was seen as a positive good. OK, it was equated with being modern, with a modern, uh, a modern economy. And there are some of the, the, the ways in which that was done. OK, the, this is all very topical again, isn't it? Tariffs. OK, so Australia applied them. Victoria began in colonial Victoria really in the 1860s, protected tariffs to build up your industry behind the tariff wall. Australia adopted its first protective, genuinely protective tariff as a country in what, 198, and then in 19, you know, about 1921, they go up again, and then in 1930, they go up again. And then, you know, in the 1960s, they're going up again and, and, and so on. OK, so these are taxes on foreign goods designed to protect local industry from foreign competition. And, and this was a policy that was pursued with considerable costs, as I suspect we're about to see again in, in the United States and other countries as a result of what's happening at the moment. But the Australian government pursued a very a a decided policy that aimed at promoting manufacturing, promoting industry. um Australian government has sometimes imposed import controls, OK, um, as, as a way of sort of protecting what's called the balance of payments, ensuring, That uh you're not bringing in too goods of too great a value compared to what you're able to export. So in the 1950s, for instance, Australia had import controls. defence industry, we're still seeing, aren't we, government using, defence this has been a big thing with the present government, government using defence industry in order to affect as a as a kind of industry assistance, effectively to develop manufacturing. It's a big thing for South Australia, isn't it? Because it, you know, again half dependency kicks in here. South Australia's had significant defence industry since at least the 1940s. Um, governments provide infrastructure to promote industrialization. The Snowy Mountains back in the Snowy Mountains. Snowy Mountains scheme. Hydroelectric scheme developed in the 1940s and onwards through to the 1970s, was basically about, it was about two things, it was about irrigation for agriculture, but it was also about providing sufficient power to fuel industry in New South Wales and Victoria in particular. OK, and that's government provided infrastructure, you know, made with government loans, big American loans and things like that, that government built, essentially to provide the power, uh, that the industry, that factories would need in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s to develop. Um, and, and various other things. Immigration was on Australia's post World War II immigration programme was basically designed to, to, to, um, you know. If you like, inhabit the factories to to to promote Australia's industrialization by providing labour, but also by providing demand. OK, by increasing the population, you'd be increasing demand, you'd increase the incentives for manufacturers to produce, uh, you, you'd increase economies of scale. So that manufacturers could produce profitably for the local market, OK, manufacturing was very much in Australian history conceived as producing for the local market, at least until the 1980s, but more of that later in the course. Incentives for research and development, so you basically give companies money. In order to, uh, so that they'll they'll, uh, engage in, in, in, in research that, uh, you know, provides high, higher tech forms of production that's supposed to improve their competitiveness and their overall performance and productivity and so on. So, um, the state can be very important in that, but it can't, it can't determine things, OK, it can't determine things, not in a liberal democracy, I mean maybe in, You know, Stalin's Russia, uh there are all sorts of ways in which, you know, uh, uh, Very rapid industrialization was promoted, including, you know, killing people who kind of resisted. But in liberal democracies where, you know, there are, there is considerable scope for markets and price signals and for personal freedoms, um, and where people demand certain standards of living, governments can't simply decide right now we're going to be manufacturers and we're gonna do that, um, and, and, This worked, OK, this broad, you know, sort of plan if you like, in a sense works. I mean, manufacturing did expand its share of gross domestic product and its employment. It's about 30%, just under 30% by the time you get to the beginning of the 1960s. So Australia is a very industrialised society by that time. However, however, Um, it's worth keeping in mind services, the provision of services like education, but many others as well, not manufacturing, have actually dominated the economy. They dominated gross domestic products. Right going all the way back to the 1800s to the 19th century, we often think of services as a mo, the modern services economy, they'll tell us. But you go to the statistics and you'll see that services have always, or at least for most of the European history of Australia, have been the largest components of the economy, um, because once you assemble a population, There is always going to be a big demand for services, whether it's, you know, insurance or education, uh, banking, uh, you know, um, street sweeping, the whole range of those sorts of things. OK, so, yeah, manufacturing is what, 29% of the economy, but services was a much bigger component even in 1959 1960 when industry, manufacturing was at its peak. In terms of exports, wool, wheat, minerals have tended to dominate exports, whaling and sealing in the very early history of European Australia, as I'll talk about uh next week. Um, so the export economy, Australia has sometimes um exported manufactured goods and continues to do so today, um, it's really raw materials that that have dominated the export component of the economy. And as I said earlier, manufacturing is now well below double figures in terms of GDP employment and so on. Um So How do we account for this broad shape of the economy as I've, I've set it out so far, um, and this is one of the challenges, I guess, of dealing with a particular national economy, because the Australian experience, in fact, often mirrors other developed economies, OK, there are some distinctive aspects to it, and I've already hinted at some of those, the, The very large uh mineral resource endowment being one of them, but in a lot of ways, the Australian experience does mirror other developed economies, and you know, the expansion of services, so the large, a large components of services which has actually gotten even bigger, is is a kind of standard pattern in developed economies. deindustrialization is another. OK, so the mature kind of European, North American economies, um, have deindustrialized, OK, you know, manufacturing has become generally a less important component. It's very uneven, some are much more. industrialising others, but that process has been very common. It's it's the appeal that Trump is making, isn't it, and has been making now for about a decade. I'll re-industrialize America, you know, uh, we'll we'll open up, we'll reopen the factories, we'll reopen the, you know, this and that. OK, it's a reaction against deindustrialization. Um, and, and the other, and capital intensive agriculture is, is, is another that we find again across different economies. Agriculture was very labour intensive in 19th century Australia, you know, in the 1800s, particularly during a harvest, for instance, um, by agriculture I'm thinking of cropping there rather than pastoralism, the sheep industry, but, The wheat industry, um, you know, basically required a vast seasonal labour force at at certain times of the year in order to, to operate, but agriculture in Australia has become increasingly uh, uh, capital intensive. Who is from a farming background, anyone would have been many more years ago. Um, so, you know, um, a much heavier reliance on capital than on than on labour, um. You know, when cotton, uh, um, um, production, for instance, took off in Australia in the 1960s, um, you know, it, it began really requiring some quite significant, uh, labour inputs, but it increasingly became sort of capital intensive, and, and, and that's been a process that has occurred across different types of cropping. Um Another aspect of um. I guess it's more distinctive, so you know, if you think of those, you know, as, as things that Australia often has in common with, with other uh developed economies. So what, what's distinctive about the Australian situation? Well, any country of course has a particular factor endowment, that is a particular kind of distribution of the inputs that are required to make anything, to produce anything. And, and, you know, so we're talking there land, labour, capital, and some would say also entrepreneurship, depending on which uh uh intellectual framework you're using, um. So, you know, how does this work for Australia? Well, foundational and fundamental, as Boyd will talk about uh in the next lecture, is the fact of settler colonialism, that um Australia was a particular form of colonialism, which in which land was appropriated from indigenous people. OK, so, um, it was fundamentally the land that the European invaders, that the colonisers wanted. For their agriculture and eventually for their mining, rather more than, not rather than, but more than the labour of the existing population. Now there are other forms of colonialism in which the emphasis is more on appropriating labour power rather than land. But in the Australian case, and this would be true broadly speaking of uh North America, it would be true broadly speaking of um uh New Zealand of, um, Uh, and, and Southern Africa, uh, up to a point, um, it's land that is appropriated, and that's fundamental to understanding the economy, it's foundational to understanding the Australian economy. The fact that that that that land was essentially taken from someone else, it was essentially stolen from someone else, and readily available for agriculture, pastoralism, and a range of economic uses, um. Beyond that, of course, the availability of land, also the availability of minerals, and these gave Australia a comparative advantage in the process in the uh um export of certain kinds of raw materials. OK, so the land was very suited, as it turned out. For wool growing, and Australia developed that particular industry to a very great extent by the 1830s Australia became the largest producer of fine wool in the world. Obviously, similarly with gold in the middle of the 19th century and as we've seen with certain types of uh other types of minerals uh since the 1950s. A third factor that we need to take into account, explaining why an economy develops in the way it does, uh, as I've already hinted in my discussion of, um, uh, the resource curse, are laws, institutions, and cultures. OK, so Australia, broadly speaking, has had, um, political stability. Governments have not generally been tossed out by overthrown by, you know, the military. Um, certainly governments come and go and political leaders come and go, but, but the institutions have had a, a great continuity and, and a reputation on the whole, for stability as well. And undoubtedly that is, um, very important around things like attracting investors, OK, and, and, and Australia has been a net importer of capital for much of its history, in fact, probably for all of its history. Um, government policy, as I've already indicated, can be very important too, if you have governments that are strong enough to set down policies that can actually shape economic outcomes, um, that can be very important in, in, in, in determining how an economy develops over time. I've referred to tariffs, for instance, the iron ore ban, I've already talked about. These are examples of state interventions that can play an important role in shaping an economy. Um, the law, uh, the reliability of the law, um, very important to investors when Australia was federating the colonies, the various colonies of Australia were federating in the 1890s. 1 of the main concerns of the, the British government, the imperial government of the day, was that British investors would be protected. Especially by the system of the courts that was going to be set up, they wanted, for instance, the avenue of appeals to the Privy Council in London to be kept open, so that if a British investor had uh um you know, litigation that they wanted to pursue, that that they. Wouldn't be reliant on near Australian courts that they could appeal to London, to the heart of Empire, OK? Obviously, uh, in the 20th century, those avenues were eventually closed off, but, you know, the reliability of the law, a sense, um, that, you know. Um, the rule of law prevails, and indeed the, the, the, the ways in which, uh, law enforces certain types of, of behaviours and prohibits, as well as enabling certain types of economic and political behaviours can be very important in shaping an economy. You know, do the, the laws, for instance, allow for um a kind of um uh capture. Of certain parts of the state by business, now in some countries that can happen, where some, some people would say that the mining industry has too much influence on governments in Australia, on particular state governments in Australia. Now where that becomes very extreme, it can actually, um, you know, it it can undermine um economic development, OK, it can lead to forms of corruption, it can turn a resource endowment into a resource curse. OK, so, um, laws are very important. The nature of industrial relations, OK, is a country strike prone or is it prone to lockouts by employers, uh, those sorts of issues can be immensely important in shaping the ways the economies developed. Australia had uh a particular, very unusual, almost unique. System of industrial relations, very centralised, in which, uh, the courts, there are certain types of courts called arbitration courts, or sometimes wages boards, played a major role in setting workers and in setting working conditions, wages and conditions. OK? Um, that often led to complaints from employers and businesses that wages were too rigid or they were too high because of that particular centralised system. That system is not not entirely gone, we still have awards and we still have tribunals, but certainly the highly centralised systems that we had between about 1904, 1900, and the 1980s have largely been wound down and, and, and that has shifted the ways in which the economy's worked. It has influence on wages, conditions, flexibilities, rigidities, and all the rest of it. Things like technical capacity, um, skill, education, now, Um, the, the nature of tertiary education in in Australia today, uh, and unfortunately things like the fees that you now have to pay, uh, all of that, uh, really emerged from a particular state intervention in the 1980s, around 1987, 1988, in which the governments of the day, the Hawke government, uh, it's education minister John Dawkins, basically said, The university system needs to be much more attuned to the needs of a modern economy. It's to serve the needs of a modern economy, it needs to train the workers of the future for their lives in our sophisticated, high-tech Australian economy. Well, it didn't quite work out that way because they envisaged that we'd have all this high-tech manufacturing, and I suspect most of you here, some of you might, most of you, you here are probably not headed for a future in high-tech manufacturing, but the governments of 1987, 1988 thought you might be, and they thought that tertiary education should basically ensure that that happens, or at least promote that outcome. So, those sorts of of state interventions can be very important, the nature of an education system can be very important in shaping um a um an economy. And things like trade policy and practise too, again, this is regulated by by governments, OK, can be through tariffs, but more generally, governments enter into free trade agreements, uh, they enter into a whole range of, of, uh, um, kind of, uh, agreements if you like, with, with countries around the world, sometimes multilateral, involving many countries, sometimes bilateral, uh, these two can shape the ways in which economies operate. OK, we're almost out of time, and, um, I don't need to, to labour all this today cause we're gonna be doing it right through the course. But one of the things I'm, I'm gonna contest, I think, and, and, you know, this will be done in a, a sort of, hopefully not, a non-dogmatic way during the course, is a kind of popular narrative, and I'll end on this note, a kind of popular narrative about.
