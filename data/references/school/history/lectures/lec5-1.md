SPEAKER 1
Right, we can start. I'll begin by acknowledging traditional owners and pay my respects to elders, people and country. OK, um, today, uh, I'm gonna be dealing with, um, transition from depression of the 30s to the Second World War. Uh, big theme will be industrialization, um, but I'll be talking about other things as well. Uh, Nick Brown, Nicholas Brown will be lecturing tomorrow at 12 on post-war reconstruction. Uh, so we've got some guest lecturers in the next little while. Nicholas tomorrow, we've got Selwyn Cornish next week, so appeal to everyone to come along. Uh, he's the Reserve Bank historian, we'll be talking about the rise of central banking. It's a, an excellent lecture, so please do come along to that. And, um, Nick's lecturing next week as well on the international aspects of post-war reconstruction. Nick Brown, that is, so yeah, um, this is the, you'll probably be pleased to hear, this is the last that you'll hear of me for um uh uh a little while, but I'll be around of course. OK, so, uh, depression of the 1930s to World War 2, that's broadly where I'll take you. Overview of the Great Depression and the road to war from Australia's point of view, couple of, um, bits on economic change, uh, and the, you know, basically in relation to the Second World War, economic change, just an overview of the, the course of the war itself. I'll be looking at the issue of industrialised Australia and uh defence, um, just looking briefly at a few aspects of the war economy, and then, uh, obviously a conclusion. So, let me begin with the depression of, um, the 1930s, just a reminder, I showed you that in the last lecture, but important to keep that in mind, the structural change that was occurring in this economy, uh, in the period between the two wars, and it's critical, as I said last time. Uh, to keep that in mind when we think about Australia during the Second World War, um, because that shift, I mean the fact that, uh, Australia has now become a significant manufacturing nation, a significant industrial nation for a country of this size by 1939 matters a lot for the, the defence of Australia, uh, between 1939 and 1945. OK, so the frailties of the economy, um, to which the First World War had contributed, um, also led to the depression of the 1930s. Australia, um, as we've discussed in the course already, was extremely exposed to international fluctuations, uh, in trade and investment, um, as well as changes in com com commodity prices around those that, that, Handful of significant commodities commodities that Australia traded internationally. Australia um as that kind of economy, a fairly open one in many respects, certainly an open export economy, um, not so open in terms of its imports, as you know, because of the tariff regime, but certainly any economy, a small economy such as Australia's dependent on its export trade in that kind of way. Was going to experience a depression in the early 1930s, there was no escaping that, um, but war debts and post-war borrowing in the 1920s greatly increased the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, um, collapsing commodity prices, disruptions to shipping, of course, during the war, and the virtual cessation, the end of international lending during that period of, of the war. Um, and, uh, you know, certainly for for developmental purposes at any rate, I mean, clearly Australia did take out loans in order to fight the war. Australia was hit by all of these problems in, in 1930, it experienced a catastrophic balance of payments problem and strong pressure from its creditors, which were primarily City of London, but now also some New York um banking interests. Um, so, uh, a new labour government was elected, uh, in, uh, the, uh, late 1929, led by James Scullin. Um, and it responded to that opening up, if you like, of the balance of payments deficit, the difference between, uh, what Australia was earning in income and what it was paying out in order to, uh, meet its interest bills and to import goods and services, that opening gap, how did the government try and deal with it? Well, firstly, by that tried and. method of raising tariffs to try to reduce the flow of goods and services into the country, to increase the protection of local manufacturers, local producers, so that it would help to close the balance of payments gap. So that was one method. Another was a grow more wheat campaign, so it urged wheat producers to. Uh respond to declining prices, declining international prices for wheat, simply by growing more. Now you can imagine if every country adopts that kind of solution to dealing with, uh, Declining commodity prices, what do you end up with? Well, you end up with a glut that simply pushes the price of wheat even further down, and this is precisely what happened in the early 1930s. And indeed, because the government had had said that, you know, it would effectively guarantee payments to wheat farmers at a certain level, the government found itself embarrassed and unable to meet its commitments that it had made to wheat farmers when it told them to increase their production. OK, so they're the sort of initial measures, there were a few others, the government abolished compulsory military training, a way of saving a few a few pounds, but, um, very much emergency measures, uh, in 1930. Um, the adoption of, um, the, um, I'll come back to him in a moment. No, let me do. So I'll just quickly go over this before I get onto the Premier's plan. So, um, in 1930, uh, an amissary, a representative of the Bank of England came to Australia, Sir Otto Niemeyer, and became really the subject of all sorts of popular criticism because his basic message was that Australia had to tighten its belt. It had to, um, decrease its spending, it had to, uh, uh, you know, governments needed to, to balance their budgets, decrease their spending. Wages needed to be cut, um, it was essentially a prescription for a radically deflationary policy that this was how um the government, this is the only way the government would be able to help the Australian economy out of the depression, and you can see here that, you know, he was subject to disparaging cartooning that, you know, basically presented him as a kind of bailiff who'd turned up in Australia. Uh, to, to, um, uh, essentially close the doors of the, of the business, um, so, you know, his, uh, visit to Australia in 1930, you know, really became a subject of, of nationalist agitation, labour movement, agitation against the money power was the phrase that was often used, you know, as, as a, a, a, a, a, you know, kind of a shorthand for finance capital. Um, and also some. Anti-Semitism. They managed the labour movement managed to construct him as Jewish even though he wasn't. So, you know, there's a long standing kind of left wing discourse around the Jewish financier as a, as a, as a, an enemy of the people and, and Niemeyer was kind of fit within that sort of, um, discourse in 1930. Um, Niemeyer's prescriptions are basically, as I said, deflationary and orthodox, and it's important to have an idea, I think, when trying to understand why orthodox or conservative opinion basically said this is what you have to do in a depression. In order to turn things around, critical, central to this was the gold standards, OK, now, um, countries had gone on and off the gold standard. Britain, uh, Australia effectively had gone off the gold standard in the First World War, Britain under Winston Churchill actually as as Chancellor of the Exchequer had brought, Um, uh, Britain back onto the gold standard in 1925, and that's often been criticised, that decision, as, um, uh, effectively, um, making the British economy less competitive and, uh, uh, paving the way for the depression that was to come. But this is the basic theory behind the gold standards, you know, as it's evolved from the early 19th century, really, from the early 1800s. That's why, of course, Australian gold was so valued in in the 19th century because it was used to back currency. The idea here was the stock of gold would determine the level of money supply, so, um, any money, paper money issued by a bank or by government eventually as they were. Um, needed to be exchangeable with gold in order for it to be, uh, considered a reliable currency, a currency that you could, um, you know, reliably, uh, uh, make your transactions with. So, backed by gold, if a trade deficit occurred, the problem that Australia had in 1930, The orthodox way of dealing with with this is that um it was necessary to export gold, to send gold out of the country, to fill the gap, OK, to fill the gap if you like, between what you were earning and what you were paying out. So, you know, you exported gold as a way of closing the balance, uh, of payments, uh, deficit. Now what happens then is with the gold exported from the country, of course, the money supply has to shrink if you're sticking to the gold standard, right, because the money supply is backed by gold, if you're sending bullion out of the country, it means that you're essentially having to shrink the amount of money that's in circulation. The effect of of that is that prices um will, will, will drop. OK, there's less money in circulation, people have less money at their disposal in order to buy things, prices are going to drop. And the idea is that if prices drop in general, that means there'll be lower pressure on wages, wages will be deflated as well, and this would gently allow exports to rise and imports to decline if there's less money in in circulation. Uh, it's, um, uh, um. Obviously harder for people to buy imports to afford imports, so there's a kind of self-correcting process that is supposed to occur in a a a sort of a conservative deflationary environment. So people understand the basic principles here. And so the idea here is you avoid inflation, you know, you, you're basically reducing the money supply as the amount of gold to back it is, is, uh, exported from the country, so you, you avoid inflation, prices go down. But the problem of course is a social and political one as much as anything else, because a reduced money supply imposes economic distress. If there's less money available, there's less investment, businesses are unable to employ the same number of people, they tend to, they'll sack workers, uh they'll stop hiring, and so, you, you know, in the process of that kind of self-correction. That is supposed to occur, there can be really considerable distress. So, famously, of course, John Maynard Keynes replied to conservative deflation, uh, advocates would say, in the long run, in the long run, exports will rise and imports will decline, and it will be self-correcting and there'll be, uh, things will be brought back into balance, OK, in the long run. Keynes's reply, people know it. What was Keynes' reply to that? In the long run, we're all dead, OK, in the long run we're all dead. What he was doing there was drawing attention to the bit at the bottom. OK. While you're waiting for the, the, the balance to occur, people are are are are basically, you know, don't have enough food to eat, don't have anywhere to live, and so on. OK, so that's any questions about that? So just a basic overview of how the gold standard works and how it fits in with the kind of conservative deflationary policy that's advocated by a Bank of England representative in Australia, who's absolutely attached to this kind of idea. Now, This is what governments come up with in Australia, when I say governments I mean governments, I mean there's 7 of them, uh, basically, uh, leaving aside local government, so the federal government and 6 state governments. I'm focusing here mainly on federal government, um. Basically government spending cuts. Um, so government did try to cut its expenditure as best it could. It was a labour government, so it had this problem that it was also supposed to be committed to maintaining living standards, but that was intended to balance budgets to restore business confidence. I've already talked about increasing production, so that was another measure, tariff increases I've I've mentioned. To cut off imports, help local manufacturers relieve pressure on the gold reserves by closing the gap between what was coming into the country's earnings and what was going out in payments, wage cuts, cut, you know, so basically wage cuts for public servants. Um, all of this sort of thing was intended to restore business confidence, to, to, to create the resources for businesses to, to invest and to, to, to export more effectively because they could be more competitive if they were paying their workers less. This was the idea. Uh, tax increases would help balance the budget, so if you're collecting more from people, uh, in the form of taxes, that would, um, help you to, to restore budget balances. Uh, interest rate cuts on local government bonds, so that is if you were, the government was lend um borrowing money from people within Australia, that would, um, you know, basically the idea was that you would cut the interest rate, that you were paying those people, and that that would help to balance the budget, there'd be more money available to the government if it was paying investors in government bonds less, and this is where governments started to run into, um, I guess certain kinds of philosophical difficulties, because this was seen, if, if you started doing this sort of stuff, it's seen as as crossing a line potentially because it's about the sanctity of contracts. So if, if, you know, You, you, you, you borrow, you lend money to your neighbour over there at a certain interest rate, you say, I'm gonna pay you 3%, uh, you know, uh, you know, basically the, the, the cost of borrowing here is 3%, and then as the, uh, person who is borrowing, you basically say, I'm only gonna pay you 2% from now on. That's a breach of contract and you, you know, obviously you can't do that in ordinary contracts, but governments can, of course, they have the power to say to people, well, we borrowed from you at 3%, but I'm going to cut the rate that we're paying you because they have the political power to do it, but it, it, it entered sort of philosophically difficult territory for governments in a liberal democracy where sanctity of contracts is is sort of seen as very important. Um, the suspension of the gold standard was another technique used that effectively Australia went off the gold standard in the depression, as Britain did. Um, and also another technique that was used, um, was the valuation of currency, and Australia did this, uh, in 1931. And one of the effects of this is that it can make your exports more competitive. OK, if you devalue your currency, you're able to sell effectively at a, a more competitive rate on an international market. So it assists exporters, it also helps local manufacturers, again, the idea is to repair the balance of payments. The problem of course is if you have multiple countries devaluing. It's a little bit like the problem that you get when you have countries putting all putting up tariffs at the same time. It can be a beggar thy neighbour approach, but certainly, um, there was an argument during the depression, uh, put by leading bankers that there was scope for the devaluation for a moderate devaluation of currency that would. Help the Australian economy, given its particular structure, in particular, given its high level of debt and it's very limited capacity to earn export income to help pay that debt, because really dependent on fundamentally three significant commodities, wool, wheat, and gold. OK? And the other technique was trying to convert overseas loans to lower rates of interest as they matured, OK, so as a loan came to the end of its contract to argue with the bankers in New York or or London or whoever it was that in the circumstances of the depression, the the rate of interest should be lower. So all these sorts of methods are used by governments, including the labour governments of Scullen. To try and deal with this crisis, this massive crisis of, of, of, of national insolvency. Of course all of this was entangled in politics and I won't go into this in enormous detail here, I obviously deal with it in the Australian political history course in greater detail. But you know, you, you had an a a series of plans if you like, solutions that were offered, so you won't be surprised to hear that there wasn't a a a a sort of a, you know, a kind of an agreement that emerges about what needs to be done in such a crisis, you inevitably had a series of, you know, different alternatives and plans that were put forward. One of those was put forward by Ted Theodore, former. Queensland Premier, treasurer, initially in the Sculen government, although he has to stand aside because a corruption scandal from Queensland catches up with him and so he has to sort of stand aside while that's resolved. But Theodore comes up with this idea for a mildly inflationary policy. In other words, he wanted to print a a a sort of a, a moderate amount of money. Um, which would be effectively a fiat currency, a fiat currency, FIAT, as in the car, fiat currency is currency that's not backed by gold, OK? And so his idea was a moderate amount of a fiat currency. I think he had it about 16,000 pounds or something, no, sorry, 16 million pounds, I should say. I don't quote me on that, but it was a moderate, uh, uh, printing of money, and that this could be used for public works. And that it would have the effect, it would have an inflationary effect, as printing money tends to do, but of course that's what they kind of wanted. They wanted a mildly inflationary effect, they wanted prices to increase in moderate amounts, OK, because one of the problems in a depression is that prices are going through the floor. OK, so that's the Theodore plan for a mildly inflationary uh strategy. And it, it, it, it's a kind of proto-K Keynesianism. I mean, by the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s, all economies basically were more or less being run in this kind of, that's how we run, as you would all know, you know, you, you folks who've lived through uh the COVID and all the rest of it. I mean, what did, what's the word they use now, quantitative easing, they call it. You know what quantitative easing really is though, don't you? Printing money, right? That's what quantitative easing is, that's what central banks did during COVID in order to deal with that crisis. So that was just on a grand scale, if you like, the kind of ideas that Theodore was proposing during the depression. Now he was outflanked by Jack Lang, a populist labour Premier of New South Wales, elected in October 1930. He comes up with an idea and it's partly to do to outflank uh Theodore, who was his political rival. And his idea was that Australia should suspend its payments of its interest bills. OK, now this is a much more radical measure, quite obviously. And it was widely criticised, it would destroy Australia's credits in London and New York, um, it would have negative effects on the reputation of the country, uh, that borrowers in the future would, would, uh, either be unprepared to lend to Australia or that they only do so at much higher interest rates because of the higher risk involved and all the rest of it. And Lang actually did default on New South Wales's debts, he did so under the Sculle government and the Sculle Sculle government basically paid New South Wales's interest bill and then tried to recover the amount. OK, and under a, I won't go into this in detail, but under a a a financial agreement. And a change to the constitution that occurred in the late 20s, basically, the federal government did effectively become responsible for state government debts for state government borrowing. So effectively, the federal government was the custodian of Australia's creditworthiness by the time we get to the 1930s, and that placed federal governments here in Canberra by this stage, of course, in a difficult situation because if you did have a state government such as Lang's defaulting. Really, the borrowers were gonna come after the federal government. Rather than after Lang, rather than after New South Wales, and that's really what they did. Lang defaulted again, uh, later, when, Uh, we I know we don't have a picture of him when uh. Um, Joseph Lyons became prime minister, so Joseph Lyons split off from the labour Party, became the head of the United Australia Party government at the beginning of 1932. Lang defaults again and this time the Lyons government basically takes a much harder line. It's a conservative government, it's less tolerant of Lang's shenanigans. It, it takes a much harder line about pursuing New South Wales over its debts. OK, so the Lyons government basically again pays, but it takes a much more stringent approach to recovering the money. And at one point you had Jack Lang, who's treasurer and premier. Uh, sending, um, uh, sending public servants with suitcases into the banks in Sydney to withdraw the government's money, a million pounds, I think they withdrew in suitcases. OK, and then they took it back to the treasury building and locked it up in the vaults there. Why? Because he was worried that the federal government would go directly to the banks and say that's our money, that's legally our money. OK, they obviously couldn't do that, uh, unless they were prepared to use force, and they did contemplate force, uh, in relation to the New South Wales Treasury building. And so the Treasury building's full of money and armed guards as you'd expect, and, uh, it, it's operating effectively like a bank. For, for a few months in 1931. So if you won the lottery, you turned up at the Treasury building to collect your winnings. Uh, public servants out in the countryside would be paid, um, by, you know, money essentially carried in suitcases by armed public servants in trains. Um, this, this was going on in the early months of 1932. I know it's bizarre, isn't it? Yes. Oh yes, yes, and there's all sorts of litigation going on, uh. So what would the federal government have done to force their hand? No, well that's controlled by state and local government, so federal government couldn't do anything much about that, yeah. Sorry, did you have a question yet? Um I'll come back to it though, yeah. I was Yes, yes, often even in in the fairly recent past, premiers have sometimes been treasurer as well. John Bannon in the 1980s in South Australia was Premier and treasurer, for instance, but yes, so Lang's in the Premier's office is in the top floor, and the treasury is underneath with all the vaults, basically. So, to answer your question, there were ways in which the federal government was able to seize certain monies, there were certain grants, for instance, that were, you know, owed, In the ordinary course of events by the Commonwealth to New South Wales, and, and, you know, it just wouldn't pay them, so I did that sort of thing, but we're talking defaults of over a million pounds to to New York and London bankers, and so it's a, it's a large amount of money that needs to be recovered. Um, the Lyons government passed legislation in early 1932 to strengthen its hand in dealing with, with New South Wales, um, to try and, uh, you know, authorise the seizure of government assets and government monies, monies that, I mean, a classic one is, is income tax because. Income tax is mainly a state tax in this period, OK, so there was a federal income tax as well from 1915, but most income tax was paid to state governments, and so, you know, the, the, the, the federal government is flirting, can it, can it actually force people to pay their income tax liability directly to the federal government instead of New South Wales as a way of recovering the money. Um, in the end, the solution, Do people know how this was resolved as it was in May 1932? OK, so it's first of the dismissals in Australia, so the governor dismissed Lang, he sacked him. He said that um Lang had issued an illegal directive to the public service to seize monies that were owing to the Commonwealth, um, and, uh, he dismissed Lang. He, he used that as a, um, the rationalisation for dismissing Lang, uh, so there was an election held in June and Lang was defeated, labour was defeated. OK, so. That was sort of the the resolution of that crisis, but um that that that's the crisis that unfolds in 1931, 1932 between New South Wales and and the federal government. So, um, I've dealt with that, yeah, so you had this, this battle of the plans, I've talked about that. The plan that the, um, federal government, the, the skull and so if I go back now to the sculle government before it's fall, and I won't go into the circumstances of its fall, which is a political history issue rather than I think what we're dealing with today, um. The the official government position, Scullin government's position was the Theodore plan. What I described earlier is that mildly inflationary printing of money and public works approach. They couldn't get it past the Commonwealth Bank board which needed needed its cooperation and couldn't get it through the Senate. labour didn't control the upper house of the Federal parliament. And so what they eventually settled on is called the Premier's plan, a plan that's more or less agreed between the premiers. Uh, although very reluctantly and partially by Lang, um, who agrees to it and then breaks it straight away through his defaults, um, but the Premier's plan was a broadly deflationary policy. It wasn't as radically deflationary as old Niemeyer back in 1930. His idea was called the Melbourne Agreement, the Niemeyer Plan or the Melbourne Agreement was radically deflationary. But the premier's plan was broadly uh deflationary, OK, so, you know, cuts to, to government spending, cuts to public service salaries, there are also cuts going on, the, the arbitration court cuts the basic wage, so there's a broadly deflationary aspect to it, but keep in mind, governments are also running deficits. They are running budget deficits during this period. And of course that is inflationary. I mean if you, you are running budget deficits routinely as governments were during this period, there was an inflationary aspect to government policy as well, but certainly the broad thrust of policy was to cut, cut, cut. And of course the problem with the cutting and the cutting is that that, you know, there's less money in circulation, people are being paid less, it means they can buy less. There's a kind of bottom of the barrel aspect that goes on with this. And, and that's why these ideas became so criticised in the 1930s internationally and were in many ways superseded by, uh, Keynesians. Economic policy, you know, really internationally from the mid-30s, I mean the, the New Deal in the United States embodies some of those kinds of ideas. Hitler, his rearmament and, and, and expenditures of the 1930s in many ways foreshadowed the the the kinds of inflationary policies that that would become de rigueur in the decades ahead. And Australia adopts a broadly Keynesian approach from its first wartime budget in November 1939. OK, so, um. I'll leave it there, just a a a broad, before I get onto the war, a broad sense of the imperial context. Australia is a dependent economy. OK, not quite a colonial economy, but it has all the features really of of a colonial economy. It's a highly dependent economy. And so what's happening in Britain in particular is critically important to what's to to the Australian scene. And here are some important developments here that that do shape um the Australian experience of in response to the depression. Um, Britain adopts a tariff in 1931. Now Britain had traditionally been a free trade country, but it adopts a tariff in 1931. Now the broad thrust of doing that kind of thing, and it's reinforced by some of the things further down the list, is that it facilitates a move towards a more um autarchic approach. I talked about autotaki, didn't I, in an earlier lecture. Um, because if you've adopted a tariff, it means that you can give preference to some countries over others within that tariff regime. You can't do that if you're a free trade country or you have very, very low tariffs. Your capacity to use tariffs to say, give an advantage to this country in your market and a disadvantage to this country is rather slight. I mean you can do it, they do it in all sorts of ways now with licences and. You know, I regulations, but broadly speaking, you need to have a tariff at a reasonable level to have tariff preference, to be able to use tariffs to to try and direct trade. It's really what Trump's doing at the moment. Britain also drops the gold drops the gold standard, OK, and that, um, is, is in many ways destabilising for the global order. Um, but broadly speaking, of course, um, uh, imperial countries, countries that were part of the British Empire. Um, kept a peg, if you like, between their currency and pound sterling, OK, so Australian, the Australian pound tended to track pound sterling, OK, because of Australia's integration within the imperial economy, because Australia traded mainly with Britain, you couldn't adopt a drastically different value for the Australian pound compared to the British pound, pound sterling, so, but Britain. Did drop the gold standard, and what that means again, the, the effects of that were to concentrate, um, trade, or to, to, to, you know, begin to concentrate trade within that imperial bloc, um, as distinct from trading with other countries. Australia is a participant in the Ottawa Agreements of 1932, whose basic purpose is to maximise trade within the empire. OK, to maximise trade, to bring about greater stability within economic and financial stability within the empire, and economic growth within the empire by concentrating as much trade as possible within it. What you're seeing here in the 30s is the division of the world into more sharply defined trading blocks. Does it sound familiar to you? We seem to be entering that world once again at the moment, but not with Britain leading it. The United States and the the the kind of result of this was the formation of something called the Sterling block. It's important, as I explained in recent lecture to understand what this is all about. The Sterling block is a bunch of countries, most of them kind of British Empire countries, although Canada remained out of it, because of its very close economic relationship with the United States, but the Sterling block, Basically is a group of countries that trade in pound sterling. OK, they trade in pound sterling. It's almost like a system of barter, in a way. It's almost like a system of barter, so, you know, Australian wool for British manufactured goods, and yet you're trading in sterling, so it's almost like exchanging goods directly in a way. OK, because you, you, you, you've um essentially doing your trade in currencies that are pegged to one another. And the sterling block as a whole, of course, had the capacity to to earn hard currencies. The hardest currency of all, of course, the one everyone wants is the greenback. Everyone wants American dollars. OK, you can buy oil with it, you can do anything with it. OK, so they all want American dollars, they pool their hard currencies, they pool their American dollars, and they draw on them by agreement. OK, so Australia would earn American dollars from the export of wool. OK, and under the sterling balances, the sterling agreements that would be put in a pool, and Australia might say, oh, we want to spend this amount of money, this amount of American dollars to buy this machinery, but, um, what, what we, we won't spend this money we earned in American dollars on our wool, but if you British wouldn't mind giving us, um, you know, allowing the export of these cars. You know, basically, uh, at a certain rate, at a, you know, a particular rate. So it's, it's based on a kind of a series of, if you like, bargains, a series of bargains among these countries about how they'll use their the the pool of hard currency and what kinds of arrangements they're prepared to make with one another in each other's markets. OK, so it's broad thrust is imperial Autarchy. In 1936, Australia adopts what's called the trade diversion policy of 19 of 1936, and its purpose basically, Is to strengthen. This imperial Autarchy, to strengthen Australia's trade with Britain, to uh redirect trade from Japan, cause it was a developing trade between Australia and Japan in the 20s and 30s, particularly in wool, and so it discriminated against Japan, it also discriminated against the United States, but it discriminated in favour of Britain. This was all about Australia's, and I'm gonna get onto this now, as I get onto the war, Australia's industrial ambitions. OK, because Australia hitched its wagon to British industry. OK, it wanted, for instance, British car manufacturers to set up in Australia behind the tariff wall to ensure that Australia had a car industry, so that's one of the ambitions of the 1930s. And so, imperial uh preference, the trade, sorry, the trade diversion policy was really about tying the Australian economy more tightly to Britain's. OK, for the purposes especially of industrialization. And as you get to that period 1936, 738, 939, as I'll talk about in a moment, it's also closely tied to the demands of defence. This is a much less secure world and everyone knew from the First World War, you needed industry if you're gonna be able to defend yourself. OK, so when we, if we go back to those numbers. Right at the beginning, that's where it's coming from, in a lot of ways, and it's coming from a range of impulses, we talked about some of them last time, for instance, the, uh, so it's not been used for some time, we don't want to shutdown or cancel that, um. Um, you know, the, the development of the consumer economy and all the rest of it, but it's also being driven by state policy, through things like tariffs, government contracts, and all the rest of it. So let me talk now, briefly, having done all that, about how this pans out in the Second World War. OK. So, The Second World War was a good war for Australia economically. We don't normally describe wars as good things and they're horrible things, but if we compare World War 1, the experience of World War 1, the experience of World War 2, well there you have it. OK, if we didn't remember the First World War as a war, we'd remember it as a depression. OK, the the economy contracted, look at it. But World War 2, gross domestic product grew by 26%, GDP per capita grew by 17%. This is a period of immense economic growth. How do we account for this? Look at, look at industrialization, as we said before, already approaching 50% of the economy by 1939, look at it, 10 years later. Over a quarter. OK, this is an industrialised country, OK, and World War 2 had had a great deal to do with that. It's important to keep in mind that um, Australia had re-armed from about 1933 onwards. OK, Australia had re-armed. The Australian government relied on British naval power, and what was called the Singapore strategy, the idea of a naval base in Singapore that would protect Australia. But the Australian governments of the 20s and 30s were never foolish enough to believe that it was a foolproof plan. They always suspected that there were problems with the Singapore strategy, because it depended on Bri Britain being willing and able to send naval assets to the Pacific in the event of war. What would happen if Britain were threatened in the northern hemisphere? Would it be in a position, To send naval assets to a to a base in Singapore, the, the base itself, of course, was only completed on the eve of the war in 1938 and indeed was abandoned for a time as a project during the 1920s. So, there was always a fear that that that the reliance, Australian reliance on uh the naval power of Britain would would be uh misplaced. And so Australia really from the early 1920s does pursue a kind of alternative path alongside it. And this is the path of a of defence self-reliance, and, and it's heavily, heavily dependent on, um, industrialization. It's heavily dependent on uh state sponsored defence industry. And so you get this during the 1920s and 1930s, the development of government factories, the development of government laboratories, uh, all of which are basically engaged in this process of making Australia more defensible in the event of an attack, and the enemy is always conceived as likely to be Japan. During this period, OK, so Um, you, you have these two tracks, and one of them bears significantly on what we're talking about here because it was a promoter of industrialization. It basically said, look, uh, Australia is vulnerable, perhaps not to an invasion, but Australia is vulnerable to, uh, coastal raids, that Australia is vulnerable to air attack, and the only way that the country can be defended if British naval power isn't. is if we're industrialised, as if we have high tech by the standards of the day, industry is capable of defending Australia. So one of the preoccupations of Australian governments of the 1930s under the kinds of stuff I was talking about earlier, this sort of thing, they want an aircraft industry. So the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporations formed in 1936. Um, in order to do that, And by the time we get to the Second World War, Australia is indeed capable of producing its own warplanes. Now they weren't the world's best warplanes, but they, they saw combat back, there were lots of them. And by the end of the of the Second World War, Australia had the 4th largest air force in the world. OK, after US Soviet Union, United Kingdom, then Australia. That's the scale we're talking about. Australia was, One of the leading, it was in the top 10 manufacturing countries in overall output. OK, it's not relative to population overall, by the time we get to 1945. OK, so if you want a clue about why Australia was able to defend itself successfully in the Second World War, this is critical. Australia did form an alliance with the United States from 1941 onwards, after Japan's entry into the war. But the appeal and usefulness of Australia to the allies generally and to the United States is that it was both a food bowl and an arsenal. It was able to produce large amounts of food very efficiently, uh for Australian forces, for US forces, but it was also able to supply goods on a significant scale. Australia even had a go at a tank, so before Australia had produced, A motor car that had a go at producing a tank. This was often done in the face of hostility from the United States, uh which preferred that Australia simply relied on overseas supplies of planes and tanks, but this. The Australian government really in many ways continuing its policies of the 1920s and 1930s, continued that course of of self-reliance of, of basically arguing we could not in the end be utterly dependent on even an ally for our, for our defence, for the country's defence. And so it goes down this sort of path. In terms of financing the war, Australia also does it very differently from the First World War. You go back to the First World War, how Australia do it. It, it, it took out overseas war loans, it printed money for inflationary, it did some domestic war loans. Um, Australia comes out of the First World War in an economically weak position, with huge debts and, uh, with, uh, not terribly much to show for the war economically. Australia operates very differently in the Second World War, um. It financed the war through high levels of taxation. OK, in 1942, the federal government through a court case gains control or initially through legislation, then through a court case, gains control of income tax, for instance. So when you, who's put an income tax form in here, you've done an income people put an income tax here, you do it to the federal government, right? You don't do it to your state or territory government. That's because of the change of 1942. Um, people on lower incomes, working class people, were drawn into the income tax system for the first time. They were paying tax. Most lower income people had not paid income tax previously. There's a transition going on here, of course, from reliance on customs and excise, the old tariffs, to reliance on income tax as a primary form of government revenue. World War 2 boosts that enormously, so, High levels of taxation, that also has the effect of suppressing demand. So if you're taxing people, they have less money to spend on consumer goods, it means that there's more money available for war-related production. You're not stimulating demand for chocolates. OK, because you've basically taken money out of people's pockets through taxation. The other way that they sought to take money out of people's pockets was by persuading them to lend money to the government. OK, and they were war bonds, and, and one of the, you know, major preoccupations of figures like John Curtin, the Prime Minister during the Second World War, was to go out and persuade people to buy war bonds, to lend money to the government again took money out of circulation, it made money available to the government for war-related matters. In terms of also um uh the, the general buoyancy of the economy, remember it's uh Australia, um, most of Australia's fighting is done in the general vicinity of Australia, and this stimulates demand for goods within Australia to supply both American and Australian forces and some British ones too, OK? OK, you don't have demand being dragged out of the economy, as happened in the First World War, when you had, you know, 300 and 1000 people, men mainly sent to the northern hemisphere. The most of them are here. I mean, obviously Australians are fighting in Europe and Africa as well. Uh, Middle East, but much of the fighting, of course, is done here, particularly from 1940, late 1941 onwards. So that's also a factor in driving economic growth in driving development. There's a massive transition from peacetime to wartime manufacturing, and then of course eventually, as you'll hear about tomorrow, uh, back into peacetime manufacturing after the war. OK, so this gives an enormous boost. Women are drawn. Into the, uh, industrial economy on a significant scale. They're brought into a non-traditional occupations, you know, one very conspicuous example was the so-called Connie, tram conductors in Melbourne, but more generally, women are brought into the, uh, industrial economy and the service economy on a much larger scale. It, it really lays the foundations for, uh, women's higher levels of participation in the paid economy. Outside domestic service, that traditional role in the post-war era, they had to set up a women's employment board to set the wages, and indeed in some occupations, women's wages were approaching the male rates by the time you got to the end of the Second World War. Certainly 90% was very common, uh, during the Second World War. You had women also involved in uh. Filling gaps in rural production, so women's land army was formed in order to, to do the harvest and and so, particularly harvesting which was still very heavily dependent on, on labour. So, You had all of this, this going on, the government itself is much more um uh uh. You know, sort of, um, interventionist in the economy than it had been in the First World War. So governments introduced a rationing system for a whole range of goods. They sort of begin with petrol in 1940, but a whole range of goods, clothing, um, uh, various necessities, uh. A whole range of goods are rationed during the Second World War. You had to have a ration booklet, uh, in order to buy the goods, so you handed over your money, but the money wasn't enough. You also had to have a ration card for, for, for tea or whatever it was that you were, you were buying. Um, so the, the purpose of rationing, of course, was again to control the distribution of resources between the war economy. And the consumer economy, and to minimise uh uh those going to the consumer economy, um, You know, you had all sorts of strange austerity measures that the um Minister for War organisation of Industry, John Dedman, You know, became associated with this idea of a victory suit, and you can see there, there's no proper waistcoats and the cuffs are a bit crude and all the rest of it, and the idea is buy the victory suit and help, you know, Australia win the war. But it was, it was all about, you know, again minimising the inputs into the consumer economy. The idea was here that, you know, it's a kind of cheaper sort of more austere suit but um you know, it's your patriotic duty.
