SPEAKER 1
OK, are we ready? Ready to go. Um, I'll begin by acknowledging traditional owners of the land on which we meet, the Nunar and Nambu and pay my respects to people, elders, and country. Um, that's the title of today's lecture, um, but, uh, for the first part of it, we have Doctor Nicole McLennan from the National Museum, who has come in to, uh, lecture on a particular aspect of, uh, this topic, and that is horsepower. So, without further ado, thank you to Nicole for, Agreeing to do that, and let me just go in and find, oops, there we are. Horsepower, uh, so Nicole, uh, works as a curator and social historian, uh, historian of immigration, uh, some years ago, uh, at the National Museum, she worked on, uh, an exhibition on the horse in Australia called Spirited, I suppose, uh, the, the, um, some of the material, uh, that you'll be hearing about today came from that particular experience. So without further ado, over to Nicole.

SPEAKER 2
Hi everyone, um, now for this talk, what I want you to do is to use your imagination. I'll be talking to you about a time when horses, not cars filled the streets. It is recalling the loads, Malcolm Kennedy observes that many historians have been preoccupied by the impact of railways in accounts of developments of the colonial economies. Meaning the vital role of animals such as horses has been largely overlooked. Yet for a period of about 100 years between 1830 and 1930, it was the horse that provided the source of motive power. On which the city was built, industry, agriculture and transport depended, and the economy was ultimately founded. Horses arrived in Australia with the first fleet in 1788. Some seven horses were picked up at the Cape Town, but in the first decades after European arrival, horses remained scarce. Instead, early colonial society was powered by enforced convict labour. 12 years after the first fleet, horse numbers still remained small. In 1800, there were 203 horses. More than half were owned by military officers, while Emancipists, these former convicts and free settlers, owned 68, and the government just 30. It was a situation which changed rapidly as more horses were bred and imported into the colony. It was largely to satisfy the demand of those wealthy emancipists and free settlers who bought bred and rode horses as symbols of their success. By 1808, they owned 666 horses, while officers owned a further 227 and the government 47. Prominent entrepreneurial family, the MacArthurs, were among the first to use horses as a source of power, both for pleasure and profit. They ran a light horse drawn vehicle and a heavier cart, and apparently Mr. McArthur also set a plough to work and sometimes used by oxen and by horses. Horse numbers continued to increase. By 1847, there were over 70,000 horses in the colony of New South Wales, which at that time included present day Victoria and Queensland. By 1850, there was a ratio of 1 horse for every 2.5 people. Uh, the picture on the screen is one of the earliest depictions of horses in Australia. The spread of settlement owed much to the saddle horse. Using saddle horses, squatters could occupy and control livestock on large areas of unfenced land. In this work, the squatter and his horse were almost inseparable for managing and defending the run. The practise of moving cattle and sheep out to new grazing land was known as over landing. And it required a team of skilled riders and their mounts. Although time consuming, over landing was a cheap and effective form of transportation. Overlanders can move stock from New South Wales to markets in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide at a fraction of the cost of coastal shipping, and during the gold rushes, there were huge profits to be made by droving livestock to the gold fields. The average over landing team for a mob of say 1000 to 1,000.5 cattle comprised some 10 drovers, a cook who was also in charge of a horse-drawn wagonet, and a horse tailor who cared for the 40 or so saddle horses which were required for short trips, or some 120 horses which were required for longer journeys. For a drover, horses were their tools of trade. Even when stations were enclosed by fences, their vast size meant that mounted stockmen were required to muster stock, that is to gather them together, to move the herd, to cut out beasts from the mob. And boundary riders were engaged to scout the edges of the property, to check on the condition of the beasts, to fend off predators, to deal with injured animals, and to make running repairs to fences. Horses also powered the productive farm. Farmers required a range of horses, saddle horses for travelling around the property, again moving stock and venturing also, just travelling generally beyond the farm. Light draught horses for pulling, be it a cart loaded with farm supplies or buggy to get the family to church. And a team of draught horses, so draught horses being those great big huge horses, um, that could be hitched to a wagon to take produce to town to power farm machinery like a chaff cutter or a thresher, or to pull the array of horse-drawn farm implements needed to till the soil, plant the seed, spread the fertiliser, harvest the grain, among other things. Now fueling horses, as in feeding them, was a crucial aspect to using horsepower, whether for speed or for strength. Horses need to be fed early enough to digest their food in order to become productive animals and maintain their condition. On farms, it was also essential to devote space to growing the food required by the livestock. Now one man, Travis Bridgeman, noted on his father's farm, they cropped 140 acres for oats and hay every year to feed the horses, sheep, and the milk cows. The ability of a farmer to grow fodder required for his stock reduced his costs and ensured that his property was self-reliant. Any leftover from the harvest was sold, typically to be purchased by horse owners in the towns and the cities. And indeed by 1900, 1/5 of the hay produced on farms in Victoria was being consumed by horses in Melbourne. So working horses also set the rhythm of the day. As a boy on the family farm in the 1930s, Lee Knight recalled how the day of the farm was structured around horses. He said, you'd start early in the day by going and getting them the horses out of the grass paddock. Then they had to be watered, fed and harnessed. They then had to be walked to the paddock which was being worked. After being attached to the plough, harrows, combine, or harvester, they then began work in the paddock. They stopped regularly for the horses to have a rest. A lunchtime break was more for the horses than for the farmer. At the end of the day, chains had to be disconnected, the horses mustered, and equipment gathered in the dray. The horse team then had to be walked to the stable yard. There they were unharnessed, fed and watered, sometimes rubbed down, cuts, scut cut or split hooves attended to, and after all this, the draught horses were taken out to the grass paddock for the night. It was then the farmer got to eat. Knight's account of his day took place, as I said in the 1930s, but the daily routine of those in charge of horses had barely changed for over a century. Whether the work was in saddle or in draught took place in an urban or a rural setting. That routine encompassed fuel, work and rest. In the earliest days of settlement, the ability of colonists to transport goods over long distances or more uh or move heavy heavy loads was limited by the lack of draught power. That is, you know, that pulling actually it's technically pushing power, they push a vehicle along. Initially bullocks had the advantages over horses and haulage. Because horses required more care, more expensive gear were less hardy and cost more. The widespread use of horses only became economically viable as the condition of the roads improved and the price of draught horses reduced. Another turning point in the development of an effective and efficient horse-drawn haulage industry was the design of vehicles suited to a local environment. While most early vehicles were imported from Britain. In the second half of the 19th century, the United States became more reliant as a source of design of horse-drawn vehicles that were better to be able to be better able to be able to withstand Australia's rough conditions. A wide range of horse-drawn vehicles were used in haulage across Australia's roads and tracks, but the wagon was the favourite of carriers in both urban and rural areas. The largest horse-drawn vehicle, the tabletop wagon, was developed in the 19th century, and uh the two images there show tabletop wagons. It was built in Australia for local conditions to enable the transport of bumper loads of wool and wheat from properties to the local railhead or port. Designed for heavy haulage, it had a concave tray that helped support large loads of up to 12 tonnes. The number of horses required depended on the weight of the load and the condition of the roads. As you can see from the top one, they're not always very good roads. Usually one horse was needed per tonne, and I'll let you do the math on those. The expansion of the rail network was not a problem for the horse industry as it created demand for carriage to and from the lane the line. Railheads became the focus of horsework as in between the rail lines were vast areas that needed to be traversed. As late as World War 2, horses would be relied on to haul wheat and wool to the railheads. Horses were equally crucial to passenger transport, as they can maintain speed over vast distances. Teams of between 2 and 6 horses pulled the coaches. Again, the horses needed rest, food and water, in this case, every 24 to 48 kilometres. And the teams will change regularly. Coaching firms competed to be the fastest on the roads to the newly found gold fields, and a network of hotels was established to support the changing of teams along the route. Perhaps no no company was more successful than the Cobb and Co. An enterprise begun by an American. Until the 1850s, its operation was underpinned by male contract, which whose, sorry, the the successful delivery required a regular organised transport with vehicles stoutly built to withstand the toughest conditions, good horses, and plenty of them, and skillful drivers. By 1870, the company was vast. It harnessed 6000 horses a day, covered 28,000 miles, which is about 45,000 kilometres a week, and received 95,000 pounds a year for carrying the mail. As a number of scholars recognised, the power of the horse was not in just what it could pull or how fast or how far it could travel, but in the vast number of associated trades that emerged to ensure that horses continued to work. A large proportion of country towns um were reliant on this, the saddler, the blacksmith, the coach, the implement maker, the grain and fodder merchant. They all used horses to make their living. To take the 5 examples pictured. Farmers loaded their horse drawn wagon with harvest and sold it to grain merchants like Sam Ward at Hill End. In turn, Sam retailed the hay, chaff, and corn to the horse owners in town. In the same town during the 1870s, some six settlers, including Richard Russell, were able to make a living. In addition to manufacturing harnesses, collars, and saddles, the country town saddler might repad an old buggy or sulky seat or even mend a farmer's boots. Businesses like Dave Price's general store in Wentworth offered a range of goods including horse-drawn and agricultural implements. Like other store holders, he knew that when a team arrived in town and empties its load at the railhead, it restocked with supplies, returning to the farm or station laden with his, hopefully his, general merchandise. We and Percy's um towers carriage factory and Charters Towers supplied a range of horse-drawn vehicles, the cheap sulky for a quick day's travel, a dre to transport goods, or a covered buggy to accommodate a small family. While travellers passing through Gulgong might stop at a hotel like the Harp of Erin. Their horse and carriage would be accommodated next doors Queensland's horse bazaar stables, and locals who required transport could hire a saddle horse or a carriage from the stable or purchase one at their regular auctions. Remember what I said about imagining a horse filled street? Think of that as rush hour. Urban areas were also home to humans and horses. By the 1850s, the centre of Melbourne was famed for its horse bazaars and saleyards, as well as related trades including haylofts and granaries, farriers and saddlers. Meanwhile in Sydney in 1900, it was home to 50 livery stables, more than 100 saddlers and coach builders, and over 200 carriage and buggy proprietors. In 1916, Sydney was believed to accommodate more than 13,400 horses. City authorities introduced laws to help control horses and other beasts. In Melbourne, the earliest laws established to market the sold horses among other livestock, while others gathered um governed the actions of carters, porters and drivers who were in charge of horse-drawn vehicles. Additional regulations made it illegal for horses to be ridden on the footpath and for horses to be fed in the streets, except from in nose bags. In the suburbs, the local dairy and bakery encompass stables as they use horse-drawn vehicles to make their deliveries. Indeed, well into the 20th century, horsepower remained well suited for short local trips, such as the delivery of perishable staples that might include ice, fruit and vegetables. Uh, in the National Museum, for example, we have a, uh, a milk cart which was in use in Melbourne until the 1980s, which is extraordinarily late. As the population of cities increased, so too did the demand for public transport, as only a small proportion of the population could afford to own or maintain a horse. In Melbourne, the establishment of the Melbourne Omnibus Company in the late 1860s revolutionised public transport by providing regular urban transport at a cheap price. By 1881, that company had 1600 horses to pull its 178 buses and a team of 470 men to drive and care for those horses as they serviced 15 routes around the city. With the large number of horses in urban areas, cleanliness, disease, and odour became a mounting concern. One English writer announced that the whole of Australia reeks of horse sweat and stable dirt. The accumulation of manure was also responsible for a creation of of an army of boys to clear the streets of horse waste. They were known as scoop boys in Melbourne and block boys or sparrow starvers in Sydney. Uh, you can see one of them down there. Not quite a boy, probably a young man by the looks of things. At the end of World War 1, there were still more than 200 block boys working the city streets, cleaning manure. As a Testing the limits of horses through contests of speed, endurance and power were familiar a familiar pastime in colonial Australia. Perhaps the earliest contests involved uh horses were of course races and kangaroo hunts. As early as 1795, horse racing took place near Richmond in the colony of New South Wales, and in 1810, Governor Macquarie permitted a horse meet to be staged over three days. By the 1840s, horse racing was commonplace and even small settlements gathered together um for picnic racing. Historian Ken Inglis observed that by 1870, racing was nearly, most nearly a national sport. Today, horse racing is perhaps the last remnant of the economic power of the horse. Annually in Australia, some 500, 50,000 horses take part in races, mainly on the flat, but also in jumps and in harness. Moreover, horse racing attracts some several million people to the track and about 10 billion in bets on races. While racing helped relieve the boredom of colonial life, it also proved a way to measure the performance of individual horses and the success of breeders in engineering faster horses. The agricultural show likewise was a showcase for breeders of horse flesh and inventors of horse-drawn machinery. Um, the show emerged from ploughing competitions where the skill of the horse and driver were tested. They assessed breeds, examine performance under saddle or in harness, and rewarded those judged the best in show. While on the one hand, a source of pride, these competitions allow for the promotion of successful breeding programmes with the aim of securing future custom. Even at the end of their productive life, a horse had value. Until synthetic materials became widely available in the mid-twentieth century, horses' bodies were recycled to produce a wealth of products. Leg bones were turned into knife handles, ribs into a dye called bone black, and remaining bones were ground down to make a fertiliser. Horse hides were turned into leather, their hooves were carved into toothpicks and combs, their flesh was used as pig feed, while other remaining products might be boiled down into an oil or glue. Horse horsehair in particular was a versatile material that commanded good prices. Lightweight and durable, it was used to pad furniture, stuff mattresses and saddles, insulate walls, and to add bulk to clothing, and as medical thread. A host of business took care of the collection and recycling of horses' bodies. They were known collectively as noxious trades because of the foul smells and the waste products they generated. Rapid decline in the use and numbers of horses in the literature is overwhelmingly linked to the arrival of the motor car, truck and tractor. Jim Fitzpatrick, however, observes that the bicycle provided an earlier indication of this shift. He notes that as early as the 1890s, the bicycle attracted attention as a cheaper form of transport that was always saddled and ate nothing. It would become known as the poor man's horse. On farms, however, it was the tractor that provided an obvious indication of the power of horses being usurped by the horsepower of machines. Implements that have been previously pulled by horses were modified to enable them to be pulled by a tractor. In the city, the transformation, um, the arrival of the car rort was perhaps more dramatic. Andrew Brown May observes that the aesthetic experience of the city had changed as smoke, noise, and speed began to replace the sound, pace and odour of the horse-drawn age. By 1953, the horse population in central Melbourne was estimated at just 500. With hundreds of horses a week being sent to the abattoirs. The success of the motor car also had a disastrous flow and effect to industries that have flourished under the rein of the horse. Among others, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, and saddlers, who did not adapt to motor car construction, which many of them did, um, found themselves without a steady stream of work. As horses disappeared from the streets, stables were repurposed as a garage for the family car. By the 1930s, horses in urban areas had become part of the past. Underscoring this, most Australian cities held a back to the horse parade or pageant. The Melbourne event in 1932 involves a procession of 1000 horses and horse-drawn vehicles to a carnival at the showgrounds. Yet, as Andrew May points out, the assembled throng was recognised for what it was, a ghost of a bygone era. Thank you.

SPEAKER 1
Terrific. Thanks very much, Nicole, and I, I guess the, the horse would, uh, um, still have its era to come in the north, of course, in the cattle industry, uh, particularly in relation to indigenous labour, um, in the 20th century, um, and I think that dramatises something we'll talk about in the weeks ahead, of course, and the differences between southern and northern Australia and the, um, you know, the, the different bases of the economy, uh, the fact that Southern Australia is very much a cash. Northern Australia is a mixture of rations and and cash, so there's a kind of complex story there too. Also as you were speaking in the comment, it occurs to me that you, you could argue that there were two really significant industries in 20th century Australia. That were built on the horse, and one of them you hinted, and that was the Saddler and coachmaker, which is fundamentally the basis for the car industry in Australia. So Holden in Adelaide was a, was a, a saddler and and coachmaker, basically, um, and, and of course adapts to the assembly of, of imported and, and some locally produced, um, uh, components, uh, they'd often import the chassis of the car and other components would be produced locally. And um they adapted um you look at the of

SPEAKER 2
some of those early cars, they look very similar to horse-drawn vehicles.

SPEAKER 1
And the other big industry of course, uh, is indeed the racing industry, which is an absolutely huge industry still in, in modern Australia. So, um thanks again, Nicole. I, I, I mean, any quick questions before Nicole whips off that anyone would like to ask? Alright, well, we'll continue on then, thanks very much. OK, see ya. Um Right oh. So, we've got about 25 minutes, and what I wanna do in this part of the lecture. Is to place what we've just heard really in a broader context of the energy that runs this economy, OK, and I'm only gonna take it here up to roughly where we are in the course chronologically, so probably 1930s, 1940s really as, as Nicole did. Um, and, and to, to get a sense of, of, of, you know, how it is that, um, the economy is actually fueled, and it's, it's easy to take for granted, it's not a lecture that I used to give, uh, when this course began actually, in its current form, uh, some years ago, but I guess it, you know, as we've become. More conscious of the, the, the problem of energy, um, uh, and particularly the whole issue of renewables, um, it, it prompts various questions, I guess, about, about how the economy and, um, economies really that we've been talking about in the course were actually powered. Um, so let me begin here. I'm not gonna talk about horses, obviously, because we've heard about those at length. I'll be focusing elsewhere. Um, but really important, um, to, to think about, um, these very traditional forms of energy. Many forms of energy were traditional, um, they were ancient, and they were human, and I mean, Nicole's hinted at some of those already. Horses, of course, um, were really involved in a kind of partnership with, with human beings and, and, and. That human beings were um offering some of the energy required to to make horses work for the economy, but just going through there, walking, uh, pushing, carrying, digging, hauling, lifting, rowing, all of these are very traditional forms of, of human energy. Um, they require food, um, for instance, they require the whole range of forms of care that we need for the reproduction of, of labour, but they're of fundamental importance to the economy. I mean, people, um, for instance, tended to walk, um, in the. Days before, um, cars in, um, periods when public transport networks were often poor, um, or inadequate for people's purposes. Nicole talked about the bicycle, but it took, you know, some while before the bicycle was really recognised as a, a form of transport, as distinct from a form of leisure. OK? Um, that's really only happening at the very end of the 19th century, so walking is very important. Pushing and carrying um the human energy required for instance, on the walls, you know, so um. You know, wharf labour, particularly from the middle of the 20th century, became very automated, that the rise of the container containerisation as it was called, but if we're talking about something like wharf labour in the 19th century, in the early decades of the 20th century, it is labour intensive, it requires great strength, OK, um. And one could go through all of those carrying, digging, we've talked about the gold rushes, quite obviously, um, human labour involved in digging for gold, hauling, lifting, rowing, all of these are really important in powering the economy. Um carters and drivers that Nicole, um, talked about, for instance, you know, were involved, yes, they used horses, but, um, we're also clearly using human labour for various forms, they're transferring goods. From a particular, um, cart or carriage to a warehouse or whatever it happened to be. So all of that, um, is, uh, you know, very hard work. Geoffrey Blainey very interestingly points out that a number of these forms of labour also give rise to, um, forms of kind of competition and leisure. A very good example would be the woodshop. I guess everyone here would be too young maybe to who's seen woodchopping as as a competition? Maybe you've seen it as a show, agricultural show. Um, you know, much bigger once upon a time, when I was a kid than it is than it is today, but a good example really of a form of labour that gives rise to, to a particular kind of competition. OK, um, so many were traditional and human. Coal, um, black coal emerges as a source of energy from the very earliest years of colonisation of Australia. OK, um, coal is very controversial today, uh, renewables are seen as an alternative to coal, um, decarbonisation is really, I think, a, a, a goal of. All governments in Australia to a greater or lesser extent today, but it emerged as in Australia as an important source of energy as early as the 1790s. OK, so you have convicts being used to mine coal at Newcastle from 1798. It's a domestic energy source. It, it, um, heats homes, for instance, um. Very importantly, it's not a significant export until the 1950s. Black coal and indeed brown coal, um, as used down in Victoria from the Latrobe Valley, are very much about domestic production. OK. Coal, as a big export industry, really begins to take off in the 1950s. It's a post World War II thing. Uh, it eventually overtakes wool as as the most, uh, valuable export at the end of the 1970s. So it becomes very important and it remains important today, um, uh, but, uh, it's essentially for domestic production in the period that we're talking about here, you know, roughly up to the Second World War. Um, it's a, a marginal energy source, I think, compared with many others through the 19th century, including the horsepower that we've been talking about. Um, communities developed around black coal mines, closely knit working class communities, you'll know many examples of these. Obviously Newcastle and Cessnock were, were, um, prominent examples in the Hunter Valley, um, uh, you know, the Maitland, of course, as well, in, in, in that area and elsewhere. So, um, working class communities developed, um, around black coal mines and, and, you know, often. You know, have very distinctive identities, um, very powerful sense of localism, uh, in, in those sorts of communities, strong traditions of, of unionism, but also of workplace organisation more generally, um, so, uh, you know, very important aspect if you like of labour history, um. Increasingly important in the 1850s since it was used for railway locomotives, OK, so the first steam locomotives in Australia, Um, appear in the 1850s, and coal is absolutely central to the development of the railways. It fuels, um, uh, it, it, it fuels railway transport. OK, so as horses and bullocks, and indeed, um, uh, well, paddle steamers, of course, uh, sometimes the more commonly used wood, timber, um, as they gave way to rail, that increased the demand. For coal, and it made coal a strategically very important product. It meant that workers in the coal industry um had potentially great um industrial power and so some of the great conflicts in Australian labour history, strikes and lockouts and all the rest of it centred on coal mining communities, some of the big strikes of the Depression era, the late 1920s, the early period of the. Depression in the early 30s was centred on the those coal communities and, and particularly in the, in the Hunter Valley. It was also, of course, a source of pollution in towns and, and cities. Coal is a, is a dirty product and, uh, it, it, um, contributed to pollution, to respiratory problems, and, uh, many other environmental type of, um, uh, sort of, um, uh, destruction. Gas and oil are also widely used, um. We've talked a bit about, about whale oil, but oil, um, can be derived from other sources as as well. I mean, we're familiar obviously in the 20th century with deep sea oil, but, you know, it could also come from shale industry. There are a whole range of ways in which oil can be, um, uh, derived, and, and gas as well was widely used for power, OK, so the gas stoker was a, a major occupation. In the later 19th century, and the question of how gas, particularly um would be uh would be supplied, would be um retailed, was very much um a a political issue. Should it be left to the private market, should it be nationalised, uh, and taken over by by governments and so on, yeah. Yes. Uh, so gas is, is basically found, um, in, uh, you know, sort of underground seams and things like that. I mean it's basically taken from underground seams, uh, it's, it, it's a relative, it's not a huge industry in, in Australia, the gas, the gas industry, but, It's very important for things like lighting. So, you know, when, when, you know, people used gas to, to light their homes, for instance. I mean, that was, that was quite common. Um, so, yeah, gas, um, oil, they, they, you know, and you can see there that, um, often it was private companies that actually did the retailing of, of, of, um, particularly of gas, yeah. Um OK, bullocks versus camels, Nicole's talked a bit about this, but, um, camels were widely used in outback Australia as an alternative to bullocks. Bullocks sort of have a, um, a kind of mythological, I talked about mythology in relation to economic history at a number number of points in the, in the course, um, and, you know, the bullocky is, is, you know, one of those kind of national types. Um, Joseph Furphy in his novel Such Is Life, which is, um, You know, attributed to Tom Collins, but the actual author is a man named Joseph Fifi. The whole book, you know, sort of the great Australian novel of the early 20th century centres on the lives of these, of these bullockies. So, um, it, uh, bullocks are a major, um, uh, you know, means of, of transporting goods as an alternative, often a cheaper and more, um, hardy alternative to horses, as Nicole mentioned, um. But particularly in in more isolated outback areas such as western, uh, New South Wales and Western Queensland. Um, a, a camel industry develops, um, really through imported camels and the workers, the con they're, they're essentially individual contractors come from various Middle Eastern countries. OK, so this is the beginnings, if you like, really of a Middle Eastern and Islamic presence in Australia and so to this very day, you'll find the occasional outback mosque. I saw one at Broken Hill, uh, a couple of years ago. Um, uh, these, uh, you know, there there's a, there's a a mosque, an old mosque in Adelaide, for instance, uh, this is very much a, a legacy of, um, the use of, um, of camels by, they were called Afghan labour, but Afghan was a catch-all word. They weren't really all from Afghanistan. In fact, most of them would be, I think, from probably current day Pakistan actually, um, many of the, of the, uh, the drivers of those of those camels, um. And they became an object of hostility of the labour movement in the later 19th century. Um, you won't be surprised to hear. So, you know, bullet drivers, um, coach drivers of various kinds, would, would mobilise racial resentments around, um, those, the, the, the, the camel industry. Uh, it is an aspect of labour politics in the 1890s. OK, um, any questions about any of that? And there there you've got such is life, um, I won't, I'll, I'll leave that on online for you to read if you, if you wish, but it, it very much focuses on the lives of, of the Bullickies, um, uh, who in the Riverina, the southern part of New South Wales. Remember, um. If you needed to transport goods in an area where there was no rail railway lines, so in other words, you needed to get goods from uh uh pastoral runs or from, from uh wheat farms or whatever to the railhead. There weren't too many options for doing that, and, and bullocks were basically one of the ways you could get them there. OK, so the economics of agriculture and pastoralism depended heavily on whether you could transport goods, whether it was wool going in one direction or supplies for a pastoral run going the other, whether you could do that efficiently. If you were too far from the railhead, um, the costs of doing this via bullock or by horse or whatever or camel for that matter, um, it would become prohibitive. OK, so, um, the economics of transport was very critical to, uh, the, uh, the industries, those pastoral industries. but can't mention the bicycle and so I won't, I won't labour it, um. But, uh, it does become an important source of transport really from the very late 19th century, as I said, it was more considered a, a, a leisure item before that. Um, and, you know, the, the bicycle's one of the ways, for instance, in the 20th century, in which shearers would get from one pastoral run to another as they, you know, did the shearing at a particular run and, and the work cut out, as it was called there, they go on to another run. Often using a bicycle to get from one place to another. So it was an efficient form of transport, a cheap form of transport. Um, as Nicole said, easier than, uh, cheaper than maintaining a horse. Um, and, you know, again, the options, or the alternatives weren't, um, terribly useful. Uh, you know, you, you generally didn't have trains that could get you from one pastoral run to another because the pastoral runs tended to be some distance from the railhead. Um, so the, the, the, um, bicycle, um, you know, suggested itself as an alternative. It would to some extent, particularly in bush areas, be overtaken in time by the car, of course, and, um, I'll talk tomorrow actually, about the, the rise of the car, including in, in rural areas, but certainly the bicycle does play a role, um, in, uh, In both urban and rural transport. Now I've already talked a bit about this and and and it's again it's it's a reminder I think of the very traditional nature of, uh, critical sources of energy in the economy, so um. We, we've talked about, you know, how the, uh, journey between Britain and Australia, um, you know, became much quicker over the, the decades, you know, from an 8 or 9 month journey at the time of the first fleet, through to the occasional clipper ship that could actually get to Australia in not much more than 2 months. Uh, by the time you get to the 1850s or 1860s, more commonly it would be 3 to 4 months, but nonetheless, uh, a major change. All of that occurs, you know. Really without steam. It's not, it's not that these become steamships. They don't. They're more efficient uses of sail. They're more efficient uses of the routes that were available, particularly, you know, discovering those that had the best winds for getting to Australia. So very important to keep in mind that often it's very ancient and traditional sources of energy. Um, which are being used more efficiently. OK, so, um, clipper ships, uh, which did what was called the Great Circle route, where they'd effectively go all the way around the globe, but they could do it within a few months, not, not the, the sort of, you know, almost a year type stuff that happens in the, um, late, uh, 18th century, the late 1700s. And another good example, um, of this sort of phenomenon, you know, so the use of wind. Um, is, is the use of windmills, and of course, you know, all of you will be familiar with that particular aspect of the Australian landscape. Um, they're imported from the United States initially, there is some Australian manufacturing of them from the 1870s, another good example of a of a of an economic linkage, rural diversification. Uh, producing, uh, new, uh, manufacturing industries, and they're used to draw bore water, so, you know, the sort of artesian waters under the, under the, under the ground. But again, in both instances, you know, it's a new, if you like a new technology that is using wind in innovative and effective, um, sorts of ways, um. And let me just, yeah, let me, I'll go back to um that one in a moment. One of the ways in which steam does emerge, Is on ships that, that, um, predominantly use sail. Now I don't know, people might have seen the SS Great Britain. Anyone here been to Bristol in the UK cause the you you've been to, to Bristol? So the SS it's a museum, you know, right there in the harbour, the Great Britain still sits, it's an enormous iron-hulled ship, um, but it combined, um, steam and and sail. OK, combined steam and so on, the way they do this is, you know, if you had really strong winds, you know, the roaring 40s were at their, their best, uh, um, you, you basically wouldn't bother with steam, you'd just let the wind do the work. If, um, the ship became becalmed, uh, that's when you, you, you'd turn on the, the steam, basically, you turn on the steam engines in order to, uh, make up for the fact that you didn't have wind. So, but, you know, combined. The two could be a very effective way of getting a ship, uh, between, you know, Britain and Australia very quickly, um, but important that these aren't ships that that rely predominantly on steam or exclusively on steam, they combine older and newer, uh, technologies. Um I won't labour this one, but the uses of water as well and water wheels, um, quite significant in the, um, gold mining industry, OK, used for things occasionally like times, like, you know, crushing crushing, all sorts of, of uses within mining. So the uses of water, again, pretty traditional form of, um, of energy. Uh, steamships, of course, do eventually take off, um, particularly from the 1860s as a result of improved engines, but they only came to dominate from about the 1880s, um, which, uh, was really, um, enabled, if you like, by the male subsidy making them profitable. So in other words, it's it's essentially a government subsidy. The uh shipping companies would have a contract to deliver mail, mail to Australia, mail from Australia, and that meant that they could use steam, uh, much more efficiently. It wasn't really, um, economical, if you like, to use steam for simply transporting things like wool, or indeed immigrants, um, but it was, uh, efficient to use it for mail because you were getting government money, you were essentially being paid, uh, uh, tax. Taxpayer money to carry the mail as quickly as you possibly could, not unlike what Nicole described for the coaches, OK, for the you know the Cobb and Co coaches, which were also essentially operating on government subsidy. We keep coming back to this in this course, don't we, the importance of state subsidy. It's there from the very beginning in convict society, but look at all of the way it's insinuated in this economic history that we're talking about, including here with maritime transport. The opening of the Suez Canal through Egypt in 1869 also provided more access to coal ports for steamers. The ships would increasingly hug the coastline, OK, as they, they went through the canal and. And, uh, that meant that they could basically go in and, and refuel, whereas the original, the, the, the main route to Australia, uh, with the clipper ships, of course, goes right down, uh, south of the Cape of Good Hope, of, of, of present-day Cape Town. Um, and they, they didn't hug. In fact, the whole point of that was not to hug the coast. It was to, to head out to make use of those, those winds, um, which were, uh, in, in the, you know, basically in the south. OK, um, I've talked briefly about paddle steamers, um, these were immensely important, uh, in, as you can see there, in transporting wool, uh, in, uh, getting supplies from the cities, um, to pastoral runs, but they're increasingly overtaken by rail. OK, it's very, um, obviously as the. Rail network develops in the 1860s, 1970s, and 1980s. Um, the paddle steamers have declining importance. They become, again, you know, sort of, I guess, an object of great nostalgia. Um, but, um, they are to some extent overtaken, um, or to a large extent overtaken by the uses of, of the railway network. Um, the, um, the railway reaches Bourke, um, in, in western New South Wales in 1885, I think, and that has a very, um, as you'd imagine, a pretty negative effect on the Darling River. Uh, paddle steamer, uh, trade. Uh, that said, it does continue for some years. One of the climactic moments in the shearers' strike, the, the wool industry strike in 1894, was when, uh, presumably unionists actually burned, uh, one of the paddle steamers, uh, um, on, on the, the Darling. Um, so they are still being used, but they're becoming a declining of significance by that time as a result of the rise of, of the railway network. But the big, the big railway lines have basically reached the major centres by essentially 1890, OK, and uh, it means that there's less dependence on the uses of, of, um, of paddle steamers. And there are some examples of those railways, they're, um, almost exclusively run by government, OK, built by contractors, uh, private contractors paid by government, but the railways themselves, we have a handful of exceptions in Australia, are basically government railways, so again we see the importance of the state of of government in this process. Um I just very briefly here talk about black coals, we're almost out of time as usual, black coal in the 20th century, um, it was, you know, an unhealthy and dangerous industry. I mean there are just within a couple of years, uh, in the early 1920s, 2 hideous, uh, um, mining accidents at Mount Morgan in Queensland which killed 75 workers and, And at Bellbird, which is at Cessnock, uh, which I mentioned a few moments ago, which killed 21, you can still, I haven't been to Mount Morgan, but you can still see the memorial at Cessnock for those miners, or at least you could last time I was in Cessnock some years ago. Um, very importantly, it's an industry that's absolutely wracked by the most antagonistic industrial relations. Um, it, it embeds deep inefficiencies, um, it's a poorly organised industry. Um, it is, uh, and, and, and it, you know, relations between capital and labour in the industry are famously antagonistic. As I mentioned earlier, huge, um, um, industrial disputes on the eve of the depression, at the beginning of the depression, including the shooting of one minor shot dead by police in a clash at Rothbury and the Hunter. And of course in 1949, uh, 1 of the, the, the landmarks, if you like, in the final months of the Chifley labour government was the, the coal strike, um, blackouts uh through Australia, um, and eventually the, the labour government sends troops in to to actually cut coal in the mines to, to break the strike, um. So, uh, you know, an, an industry in which uh extremely antagonistic industrial relations, and it really depended on the, uh, industry getting its act together, um, after the, uh, during and after the Second World War. Uh, for it to be turned into an effective, uh, export industry, there was no prospect really of coal, black coal being a significant export industry, um, before, um, I mean, uh, greater efficiencies were embedded, um, after the Second World War. And, and, you know, he had a slightly better uh set of industrial relations, um. Very importantly
