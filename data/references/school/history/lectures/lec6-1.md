SPEAKER 1
She sometimes texts me during Carlton games to console me about how they're going and and and it seems half genuine actually, which is quite nice, you know, um, that must, we must be just about, um, how do we judge this? Do we, let's go. Oh, yeah, there we go. Good. OK, good. Right. OK, well, um, welcome everyone. And, um, I was just saying to Nick, uh, I probably should be giving half my salary back at the moment, shouldn't I? Because, uh, Nick will be guest lecturing for us again, and, and in some ways it's kind of part two. so those of you who weren't here at the last one, Nicholas Brown, Professor Nicholas Brown, uh, from the School of History. Uh, and, um, lectured on, uh, the, uh, um, post-war reconstruction and it's domes mainly in its domestic aspects last time. And, uh, this time round, Nick will be picking up the, the, the international, uh, political economy and, and, uh, so on, aspects of that. Um, so thank you again to Nick. Uh, just a reminder, tomorrow, very important that everyone come. Selwyn Cornish is going to, who's the, um, Uh, official historian of the Reserve Bank, uh, amongst other things, will be lecturing us on the rise of central banking, uh, in, uh, Australia, so that's tomorrow's lecture, so again, I get, I get a, a, a, a, a very easy ride, I think, uh, to the break. So, uh, thank you again.

SPEAKER 2
He doesn't know, I've got, I've got a, uh, uh,

SPEAKER 1
um, what, what they call a handout, a handout for you, great big thick wad of handouts for, you know, the 100 students that I expect to turn up tomorrow. Um, so thank you again because it's greatly appreciated. And I do have to dip out to another event at 5:30.

SPEAKER 2
Now I know I'm supposed to be talking about that, but I didn't get to the end of what I wanted to talk about in terms of post-war reconstruction itself. So I do want to backtrack a little bit, but the international dimension I suppose is fundamental to everything that I want to say and that's partly why I began, uh last week's lecture by highlighting, Uh, the Atlantic Charter, which is really the United States saying in 1941, look, the world that's going to come out of the Second World War is going to be a very different world, our world, to the world that went into it. Um, I suppose I wanted to make, just to make two points I hope that maybe came through, uh, in, uh, last, Wednesday's lecture, um, and that is that we often talk about the Keynesian revolution as if it was the solution, or it's often presented as the solution, but I suppose, what I was trying to draw out last week was that the Keynesian revolution in fact defied profoundly new problems for economic management. Uh, those new tools of government were easily politicised. Uh, that shift towards macroeconomic control of demand, uh, and the reconfiguring of the relations between the public, state sphere, and the private or the citizen or the employee or the consumer sphere became readily politicised, uh, in the late 1940s, and I know you've got the white paper on full employment as you're reading for last week. It's very easy to read that as a manifesto. It's also got some inherent problems sitting within it. What do you do if demand gets out of control? How do you pull back those pressures which are, which are no longer amenable to direct influence? And I suppose what particularly comes through with the white paper on on full employment is the prominence of the budgetary tool, the really increasing centrality. Of each year's annual budget, it's kind of appropriate that we're having this lecture this afternoon in terms of setting the new registers for economic management, not simply in terms of how much have you got to spend, but what interests are you seeking to advance, what interests are you seeking to control that whole countercyclical reactive, corrective role of economic policy, and that's something again that I want to come back to in a later lecture. So there is that inherent problem, the politics, as well as the economic policy of the Keynesian revolution. In whose interests are you intervening? And alongside that there's the waning faith in or confidence in broader schemes of state direction as we so often associate them with the labour government of the Second of the 1940s. The the fading faith, uh, faith in direction or planning of resource allocation and control. Now, as I suggested, if we go back to labour in the 1940s, we shouldn't overestimate the extent to which labour itself, even though we might want to think, wow. of a left wing aligned socialist reformist party was itself very uncomfortable with that ideal of being too readily portrayed as being a party of the state rather than a party of the people. But what I suppose I'm emphasising both in relation to this as well as the centrality there in the shifting political agenda that will sit behind so much of the economic policy that we'll be looking at really through the 1960s and 1970s. And again, you might think I'm kind of backtracking too far. I probably am. It's there, I think, in the contrast between two really significant referenda that that that really define the shifting political agendas of the 1940s. As you might remember, I said last Wednesday that the 14 powers referendum of 1944, in which the Commonwealth government was seeking to say, we have had these powers to regulate or control very broad areas of economic. for the duration of the war, we're doing a really good job. They're central to effective economic management. Why won't you give us permission to carry them over into peace time? The Constitution enabled them to exercise those powers in times of war emergency. Once the war is passed, can we please continue to have those kinds of controls, and you, I'm not going to go back over them into peace time. That referendum was comprehensively lost. And many ways that lies behind the urgency of the white paper. Having lost that referendum to secure direct controls of the economy, the government's move was then to say if if we can't get that, then at least can we get a public commitment to regulating macroeconomic policy. Even there, there's that kind of debate that's running through the 1940s. labour did win the next referendum, the 1946 referendum on social services, um, which had a much simpler proposition. Do you approve the proposed law for the alteration of the constitution that would enable the that would enable the government to regulate the following specific areas, maternity allowances, widow's pension. Child endowment, unemployment relief, pharmaceutical sickness and hospital benefits, uh, medical and dental services, note the parentheses, but not so as to authorise any form of civic conscription. That's the response to doctors saying, don't you dare seek to regulate a private profession. So you can have government support for medical services, but you will not civilly conscript doctors, dentists, chemists, any of the professions who are claiming they have a right as private citizens to regulate their own conditions of employment. That gets through, and I suppose my basic point is that even there, you have a contrast, a sense of what's happening to Australian politics in the 1940s. No, we don't want comprehensive planning. What we do want are a series of specifically targeted benefits. They're called social services. The word welfare is absolutely avoided. They're not talking about social welfare as a broad distributive entitlement. They're talking about social services as something that you provide to people in need to help them compensate for the fluctuations of the market. And that again I think is a really interesting distinction is what's going on during this period, but there still is a huge political pushback. The referendum gets through, but there's a really strong campaign against it from the professions and from those interests that are starting to galvanise around what will become, uh, or what has already become uh the Liberal Party. And without going into this, Canberra's plan to. Take over the work of our state parliaments. This is the Canberra bureaucrats who wants more power so that he can order you around from Canberra. The queues you make you're made to stand in, the shortages he makes you endure, endure, the manpower muddles and so on. So even there in 1946, there's a sense of how far are you prepared to let the government go in planning some basic elements of the economy. And I just want to give you that, I suppose, as a, as a kind of a a contrast. So let me now take you through some of those, and I began this discussion, I want to go back to it, some of those basic elements of the post-war reconstruction agenda, which I would argue were more enduring, even though over the next couple of decades they will be adapted to the shifting politics of Australian government. So one I've already given you is the commitment in the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme to the systematic repatriation of returning soldiers. So they're not just going to be treated as here's a block of land, here's an opportunity, here's that kind of go out and be free. Idea that applied to First World War veterans, these are people whose need for skills, retraining, education, assistance, you can see the list there, what do you need? Do you need housing, do you need full-time training, do you need rural training, do you need loans? Do you need legal aid? This recognition that what you are getting in a returned serviceman, what you are getting in society more generally is a problem that needs to be addressed if we're going to make post-war Australia work. And again you can see the language is still still there, post-war planning now for post-war jobs, planning now for post-war jobs. One of the major enduring changes that comes out of that period is the recognition of the importance of a university education. Not many, you can see the numbers there, but a significant proportion of those returned servicemen are enabled to go into university places. So many that the University of Mel. For example, couldn't take them all. So a university campus was established at Mildura to take first year enrollments in those disciplines which were identified as particularly important for post-war reconstruction medicine, engineering, dentistry, science, and architecture. And even in that graph you can see how that those reconstruction scholarships, these are scholarships that are given to returned servicemen, men and some women coming back from the front or who've been mobilised into war, is a really distinctive change in the profile of university enrollments. It's in a sense, never going to be the same again. It's not until around about 1952 that you start making Commonwealth scholarships available to people like you. Students from schools who need assistance to attend universities, but at least what you have in this period, and I think this graph shows that more effectively, is the beginning of a more systematic recognition that university education from a woefully low rate in 1950.03% of the Australian population attends university. And it's really not until the 1970s that we start breaking through that 1% bracket, after which it really as you can see, increases significantly. But at least what you get coming out of that post-war recognition of education, training, skills is what I suppose we might call, and you might come back to this later on in your reflections in this course on something that I suppose economists might call human capital. This is not just muscle to put into jobs, but this is what kind of economy do we want to build around those new areas of specialised knowledge. I also gave you last week the significant transformation that occurs for the recognition of women's abilities, or not really women's abilities, but the significance of the Women's Charter in 1943 is to say, if you want women, In the workforce, having had all of this patronising stuff about the kind of specialised treatment that you need to offer women in the workforce because they're women, what you need to do is give them social services that will enable their participation. So how can you increase women's participation in the workforce if they don't have access to childcare? Now, as you know, as we know now, these agendas don't get locked in place and solve the problem forever, but my point is thresholds are being tested. Thresholds are being slowly eroded through this period. If you really are thinking about what does it mean to renew an investment in an idea of what the Australian economy might be, these are some of the areas you might want to address, and I'm still struck. By this conference deplores the continued neglect of the native race and demands immediate measures by the federal government to arrest the process of extermination. So just pause for a moment, when anybody says to you oh, Australians really didn't know until the stolen generations process what was going on. In 1943, this women's conference is saying we know what is going on out there. Is implicitly a process of extermination. I also gave you the example of regional planning, that the commitment to, OK, what, what we've realised is that the nation has extensive resources beyond the metropolitan cities that are often degraded that we need to use. It's going to be, and this is not a partisan point, not until 1972 that you get another Commonwealth agency, which is specifically established under the Whitlam government, it was called the Department of Urban and Regional Development that takes the need to systematically assess what does the economy need in terms of investment in basic services to function more effectively. Uh, and this is an attempt to rethink spatially what economic development in Australia might look like. I'll come back to the Snowy Mountain scheme later on. I've just put in there, are you from South Australia. Nupta, a little town in South Australia, was a test case for a lot of what this post Second World War regionalism might look like. Uh, it's a small area, it turns it turns into a rice growing area because of a lot of the investments that is made into it. Um, there you can see the community swimming pool that was built in in Norita somewhere around about 1946, 1947 to in a sense make it possible for this place to be a a community that you want to live in. And I know I'm already running out of time, I can't resist this, but I was taught at high school by a wonderful Australian poet, Jeff Page, who has a little, uh, his first book of poem is called Small Town Memorials, and it essentially observes, why is it? That so many Australian country towns, every country town has a memorial to the First World War, and then he says, actually, you look a little bit more closely, they don't just have memorials to the First World War, they often have memorials to the Second World War, but the memorial to the First World War might look like a soldier on a thief. The memorial to the Second World War will be a spoon. A town hall. An improved park, something that says we're not recognising heroes anymore, we're investing in the capacity of this place to become a regional centre. Um, I'll leave it at that. So there's an attempt to rethink what communities might look like, what resources people needed if they were going to escape those huge disparities that characterised access to services, access to opportunity in Australia at the on the eve of the Second World War. It's not really a joke. This is the way in which communities live. One of the things that Nupta was doing by 1950 was holding one of the first Grand Prix in Australia, motor car races. Let's get people out here on a weekend in the year to kind of celebrate what a regional community might look like. More seriously though, one of the aspects of the, of, of regional planning during this uh in post-war reconstruction was the rural reconstruction training scheme, which recognised that most of rural Australia was poor, eroded, under educated, lacking access to basic resources, and you can see there the series of reports, commissions of inquiry. It's what the Department of Post-war reconstruction did. Let's set up commissions of inquiry to show us what the problem is, whether it's access to land settlement, whether it's the kind of rural credit that people need, whether it's access to water conservation and land drainage. This is a systematic attempt to recognise what needs to be fixed. If we're going to get ourselves out of the hole we've found ourselves in, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this in last Wednesday's lecture, but Stuart McIntyre, well, you might have, it's, it's there, it's Stuart McIntyre's introduction, that, that observation that an American service has made when he arrived in Australia, uh, as part of his mobilisation of the Second World War, he said, this is what America looked like on the eve of the Civil War. Why is this place so primitive? So we have this sense that the great golden age of Australia is the most prosperous country in the world at the end of the 19th century, but by the middle of the 20th century, very different questions are being asked. Housing is another area of retention, and again it's a topical area. By the end of the 1930s, 2 decades really of very little housing construction. What do most Australians want, we want our own home. But here's the issue, what kind of home should you have access to? One of the, the, the, the signal achievements of post-war reconstruction was the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement of 1945. Which was the Commonwealth saying, again, we live in a federation, you've got to negotiate these things, but we will, the Commonwealth will make available to the states sufficient finance to build homes, uh, again, you've got the language there, dwelling of good standard and equipment is not only the right, the need, but the right of every citizen. What you might build those houses of was a bit of an issue. Uh, here's a Beaufort bomber. Beaufort factories weren't needed. Uh, just one was just outside Adelaide, were not needed at the end of the Second World War. We don't build aeroplanes anymore, so we start turning the industry, the. metal capacity the Beaufort aeroplane factories produced into the ability to produce prefabricated homes. So here's one mass produced industrialised home, readily available. You might think it's a bit ugly, you might think it's very modern. Here's a kind of debate that will run through Australia in the 40s and 50s. 0, that doesn't really look like a home. It's not made out of timber, it's not made out of bricks, it's very open. I'm used to a kind of a cottage, you can't have a cottage anymore, we don't live like that anymore, this is modernity. This is scientific housing, but I don't like it. That's not what I want, and here is this tension that's being negotiated in terms of what can industrial capacity deliver, what do people at the end of the war want? What are the really striking things, and I'm, I know I'm moving quickly here, but please go back and have a look at the slides if you want, if you, if, if anything particularly interests you. What are the central principles behind the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement, and it's absolutely relevant now to this whole debate we have about the right of Australians to home ownership. It's the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement is saying these houses should be built for rent. Because that way a government has control over the quality of the houses, the distribution of the houses, and the amenities that go with those houses. We don't just want endless speculative suburban developments, we want to control the housing market as it develops. Not only that, as you can see from that diagram, your rent will be fixed in terms of your wage. So, uh, uh, if a family income of the tenant is equal to the basic wage, the rebate, what you will get back should be an amount equivalent to the sum by which the economic rent of the dwelling exceeds 1/5 of the family income. So not only are houses going to be built for rent. Because we want to get them out there, we want to do them as a matter of state provision, but we will guarantee your rent, if you're on a basic wage will be no more than 150% of your income. And if it is, for whatever reason, because you're in a remote location or whatever, you will receive a rebate to keep you under that threshold. Now I'm not, this is not a party political point. It is in a way just a statement. It's asking you to imagine. I'm layering a sense of the world these people thought they were creating, what the role of the government might be in its dealing with private citizens. And it characterised so many aspects of the post-Second World War world, including the massive expansion into the area of immigration. Frank, I'm sorry, I, I stole this slide from you, but the, the basic point is two basic points. Firstly, the labour Party traditionally has opposed mass migration. Why? Well, you'll threaten our jobs, won't you? We don't want cheap labour, you're familiar with that argument, coming in here and taking our jobs. Secondly, this is the first time that a government has committed itself to an absolute threshold, the number of people, the word that was used was the maximum absorbtive capacity. What is the maximum number of people that we can take in every year to achieve what we want, which is stability, progress, and security. And this scheme, locked in place in 1947, really runs through uninterrupted until it starts to be chiselled away in the very different circumstances of the of 1972. Now there are a couple of the 1970s. Now there are a couple of significant points about it. there is a real, you've got it there, and Call saying you populate or perish. Now, as First Minister of immigration, I often think that statement is kind of trivialised a bit. Are we gonna populate or perish, otherwise we be overrun by Japanese. I don't think he's as crude as that. He's saying a nation of 7 million people. In a world that looks like the post World War, World War II world is going to look like, is not particularly strong. Yes, we might be strategically vulnerable, but our strategic vulnerability is also coupled to our economic vulnerability. What are we going to produce, how are we going to feed ourselves? What are we going to sell? How viable are we going to be in the world if we just stay dribbling along at this low population rate? We won't make enough people ourselves. We need to bring them in and we need to bring them in in large numbers, so yeah, we're gonna have to be highly selective. We'd ideally like to get lovely British immigrants and in all our publicity we'll say we're getting lovely British immigrants, but we can't get enough of them. And actually a lot of people don't want to leave Britain, the shipping's fairly short, but you know, where there is a lot of people, And I can take you back to that, is in displaced persons camps, all of those people in Europe who can't go home. They can't go back to where they've come from because those, there's a war. Or those places are now occupied by the Soviet Union, or they don't want to go back to communism, they don't want to go to communism. So the first place you go to are those displaced persons camps. And you go into those camps and you look around and there's a beautiful book and I am the son of an immigration official, so I've got a kind of a vested interest in this. My father was a chief migration officer in Greece in the 1950s and then in Rome in the 19 in Italy in the 1960s, which is why I was born in Rome, purely accidentally. But the role of a chief migration officer was to set up a desk in a village. And hope that people would come in and they'll sit in front of you and you'd look at them and you'd say. Yeah, OK, you'll do. What criteria have they got? You know, do the best you can. You're going to make mistakes, but remember this, Christ himself couldn't pick 12. How do you go about, Making a decision about who is going to be the ideal citizen for Australia. Well, you go for the beautiful bolts because why would they they look like us, they're tall, they're often fair. They come from the Baltic states. They have those qualities, those types that we like. And if we can't get enough of those, we might take Germans, if we can't get enough Germans, mm, maybe we'll take the Italians, and if we can't get enough Italians, we'll risk it with the Greeks. There's a shopping list, there's a desirable list of people that you would take. Initially, because what you want are bodies, but what you start seeing very quickly is, OK, not only do we want bodies, labour, To build our houses, to work on the Snowy Mountain scheme and so on, but we also want skills. So the first migration agreement that Australia signs with another country to assist in that mutual exchange of people is with the Netherlands in 1951. I don't have time to go over it, but you can see there that what the, what that agreement is saying is, we will take, we will choose who we want in terms of their skills. Engineers, doctors, you know, those kinds of skills that we need, and we have a response, and they will work for us in designated areas, we'll send them where we want them to work for 2 years, And it is our responsibility, including through the Commonwealth Employment Service, to place them in work after that. So this is not just who can we get, but by the late 1940s, certainly by the 1950s, this is a highly refined process of thinking about who do you want, not just in terms of fitness for work, but skills they can contribute to the economy. And you can see there the changing uh profile of of Australia's population from this point, and again my, my basic issue as in both of these lectures, is look at that decisive, that dramatic change around 1946. And almost you the uninterrupted growth after that. George Megalogenas in the book Fault Lines, Race Work and Politics, you can see from his name, he's Greek makes the observation that for a lot of these immigrants, what you were were underwogs. You come here to do the jobs that white Australians don't want to do. And that's the explicit argument that's made. And that is still a characteristic you might argue of each iteration of the Australian labour force. Where do people with relatively unskilled for their own circumstances, non-English speaking backgrounds go, well, they go to the jobs we don't want to do. They clean their hospitals, they work at our childcare centres or whatever. So, but I'm also arguing at the other end of the spectrum, you've also got an immigration programme that is doing two things, it's bringing in, Muscle, it's also bringing in brains, and those brains are challenging. One of the great issues that often emerges is how do we recognise the qualifications of people from overseas. You say you're a qualified doctor from I don't know, Lithuania, but you've got no papers, well, I know why I've got no papers. I'm a displaced person. So how do you prove it? I mean these debates, clearly we still live with. My argument is that they're set in place during this period. It's highly selective. Australian soldiers who were part of the occupying force in Japan who were against strict orders, formed relationships with Japanese women and married them, were not allowed to bring their wives back to Australia throughout the 190. It's only by special dispensation in 1952 that so long as they could prove they had married that woman and these men and women might have been separated from each other for four or five years, they were able to bring their wife back. So this is familiar to you all. This is a highly, it's inclusive at one level in terms of labour, it's exclusive at another level in terms of race. Sitting behind this, I suppose, is those are those kinds of transformations that we're all familiar with. Industrialization, what do we want those people for? We need them to start feeding the industrialization of Australia, and there's Ben Chifley standing beside the first Holden to roll off the production line at Fisherman's Bend in 1948. The problem is, of course, that we're not supposed to know this, but that car was actually built in Detroit. And it's called General Motors Holden because General Motors is very cleverly saying, ah, we can invest in the highly protected automobile manufacturing market in Australia, they'll stop other people's cars coming in so long as we can build our cars there. So even there you've got the beginning, I suppose, of a level of Americanization. Australia's industrialization is partly dependent upon how open we are prepared to be, not only to labour from elsewhere, but also to investment from elsewhere. And with investment, of course, comes the profits from General Motors Holden go? They go back to Detroit. The Snowy Mountain scheme probably doesn't really fit in this category because it is something that we genuinely did for ourselves, if I can use the we and it's a really, you know, it still is a remarkable global engineering experiment to turn a river around why, so that you can provide hydroelectricity for industrialization. At the time they were still thinking about um whether it would provide the kind of energy that was needed for defence and atomic development, even a nuclear reactor sound familiar, uh, and for the irrigation of farmland. This precious resource, water, why do we let the snowy river just run straight out into the sea? Let's turn it round, funnel it into the Murrumbidgee, then into the Murray, and look what we've done. It's an incredible piece of engineering. Clearly with Snowy 2.1, we're going back and trying to do it again. Even to be really topical, this place, the Australian National University was founded in 1946. Itself in a sense, if you think about the idea of post-war reconstruction. Those are three of the original founders, Marcus Oliphant is an atomic scientist, WK Hancock is a historian, Howard Florey is a uh biochemist. Both, all of them are being lured back from better careers overseas on the option that if you come to Canberra, and that's Canberra in 1946, they're probably standing somewhere over there on the shoulders of Mount Ainslie looking over this place, if you come here, we will give you an unparalleled thing. A university which is premised only on research, and research in four areas which are being identified as crucial to Australia's development. A research school of social sciences, What is the world going to look like? A research school of Pacific studies, well, all of a sudden, we're in the Pacific. We're, we're there. We've got to think about what we're going to do with. Decolonizing states, we've got to think about what we're gonna do with Papua New Guinea, a research school of physical sciences. Oliphant regretted it deeply later on, but was involved remotely in the development of the atomic bombs. about the new age of and the research school of medicine, a cutting edge discipline that had the capacity to train, but it's a research only university. No undergraduates, you're not supposed to be here. The only way we're going to get these people back is if you offer them unparalleled resources. So all I'm trying to suggest is, and already I'm running very much out of time, is that this is the kind of agenda that sits behind post-war reconstruction at a very pragmatic level. The politics of it are another matter, because the politics of it are, as you can see already about a certain kind of direction. So when labour campaigns in 1943, it can be in terms of homes for the people. Everybody should have access to a home. The following classes of people should have access to your home. In 1949, and I'll pick this up in a, in a later lecture, uh, the new Menzies Liberal Party's primary campaign is, here is a car that is free enterprise. It might be American free enterprise, but nonetheless, I'm going to woo the voter, who is the voter? A young, glamorously dressed woman from the clapped out socialisation that Chifley's offering to the prospect of a new future. OK, let me quickly try and cover what I'm supposed to be talking about today, but they are kind of connected. How does all of this relate to the changing international settings of all of this experiments? I've been, I've spoken to you so far last week and today about the domestic dimensions of Keynesianism, it's inherent tensions, debates over the role of government, the role of private enterprise, uh, in his autobiography, Nugget Coombs, again, one of the foundation architects of the ANU, talks about a trial balance. How do we find a kind of a balance between the sorts of interests that are currently at stake? And Coombs was as much as he was engaged in domestic issues. There he is walking through London uh at a at a major conference with Chifley in 1945. Uh, he's engaged in thinking about what should Australia's place in the post-war international world look like, because we can't do this by ourselves. We can't do this by ourselves. But the world is shifting dramatically. I've already showed you this. Britain essentially is bankrupt at the end of the Second World War. The United States is triumphant. The United States has already made clear in the Atlantic Charter in 1941 the condition of its entry into the Second World War. The world it sees in future is that trade barriers must be lowered. There must be free trade. The condition of Australia having access to lend lease through the mutual aid agreement was even more explicit. Uh, that in signing on to that mutual agreement, Australia agrees to promote mutually advantageous economic relations directed to the expansion by appropriate international and domestic measures of production, employment, and the exchange of consumption goods, which are the material foundations of liberty and welfare of all peoples. The language is great. But then it goes on to the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international conference and commerce and to the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers. So the United States is effectively saying, look, we've given you $23 billion in aid during the Second World War, and now we don't necessarily expect you to pay it back, but we certainly want access to your markets. So you know that whole kind of Ottawa agreement that I'm sure Frank's taken you over in 1932, the Commonwealth countries effectively saying we need to maintain a protective barrier within ourselves to keep out the United States. It's gotta go. It's gotta go. Now you are, to put it really crudely, in our hands. So Australia is facing a kind of a dilemma. There's a big shift in international architecture. There's a big shift in international way. We are still deeply dependent on Britain. Britain is still deeply dependent on, on us. During the Second World War, those ties have even got closer. Britain undertakes to buy all of our wool, all of our meat, because they needed to get through the wall. And the United States sort of comes along and says, you know what, that kind of agreement, that kind of closed market, you can't do it anymore. There's all so I'm, I'm just writing. And those of you who looked at the at the full employment white paper will also note that one of the elements of that of the commitment to full employment is no government can guarantee full employment in its own borders. The only way full employment will work is if all governments around the world are committed to full employment. But full employment is not the same as free markets. Because what Australia is saying um well. Government is also taking part in discussions relating to other forms of international collaboration designed to expand world trade and to mitigate fluctuations in prices of raw materials and foodstuff. So we can only guarantee full employment if you know, you let us also have access to your markets, and if you don't distort your prices in ways that mitigate against our workers maintaining their standards of living. So in that commitment to international full employment, there is an implicit sense that OK, you want to get access to our markets, but you also must allow access to your markets to the extent that we can guarantee our farmers' jobs, our manufacturers' jobs, exactly the time that the United States after the Second World War is protecting its farmers. All nations protect their farmers. Australia is saying, but we're an agricultural exporting country, so get rid of those trade barriers, if you're really serious about this. So getting full employment written into international agreements is a really powerful point. And it's one of those commitments that sits behind so much of Australia's international diplomacy through this period. So is seeking some way of stabilising the terms under which financial and monetary arrangements are governed. One of the characteristics of the interwar period is massive fluctuation in in financial and monetary relationships. What's coming out of the Second World War is a desire to stabilise those, but in whose terms? And there are two models under discussion. One is what's called the Keynes plan, and the Keynes plan is, it emerges really very early on in 1942. Keynes is already talking to the British government about if we win and if the United States is now the dominant country in the world, how are we going to protect the value of the pound? How are we going to protect our own market? So Keynes's model is what's called a clearing union, that is, all countries subscribe to it in terms of finances that they can and draw from it what they need in a new international currency to manage fluctuations. Keynes called this new international currency the Bancorp. And the clearing union would allow countries more extensive use of those economies experiencing exchange rate difficulties, measures such as exchange control and currency depreciation. So if we really want stability, we need to be able to regulate our internal market to achieve that kind of constancy. The United States comes back and says that's exactly what we don't want, that's exactly what you were doing before the Second World War. What we want is a stabilisation fund. You will commit to maintaining a steady rate of currency exchange. We don't want these kinds of fluctuations. We don't want these fluctuations in some funny money currency. We want them in the dominant currency that the world is now using, which just happens to be the United States dollar. So you will not restrict access of our currency to your markets, you will not manage at a bilateral level, your fluctuations in exchange rates. What we need is security. Now I'm putting it in really crude terms, um, but it's even early in this period. Australia is saying if we have no capacity to manage our exchange rate, because again, coming back to that old truism, we are essentially an agricultural exporting country, and the price of agricultural commodities fluctuates wildly, we're always going to be vulnerable to instability. So we can only enter into these agreements if something of the Keynes model prevails, that countries do from time to time as circumstances alter, have the ability to adjust their financial and currency arrangements. Already, however, there's a, you know, I, I've written a little bit about it myself. There's a London conference in 1944 before the Bretton Woods conference, which all of this gets locked in place largely in terms of the United States agenda, in which the Australian delegates are looking on and they watch the ways in which Keynes is kind of saying, you know what, we're really going to have to compromise because we are no longer as powerful as we thought we were. So, again, I'm just conscious of time. What we see in the post World War period is an attempt by Australia to lock in place as part of a range of international agreements, not only the domestic principle of full employment, but the international commitment to full employment, arguing that an international commitment to full employment means that countries must have the ability, To control their imports and their exports and their currency, to maintain that level of of of of jobs for all. The United States, however, is saying no, what we need is absolute guarantees of the constant movement of money at a set exchange rate around the world. Uh, and I, I'm sorry not to have time to go through this, but this becomes absolutely clear in 1945 when the America that negotiates its first dollar loan to the United Kingdom, because what the United States does is it abruptly terminates lend lease. There will be no more lending of money to you, there will be no more investment in you. What you will now do is take out a loan from us with conditions that we set that will need to be paid back in terms that we underwrite. And as, as Keynes put it, they're not interested in our wounds, they want us back up and running as a consuming country. They're not interested in our industry, they just want to be able to sell us stuff. And it's the same kind of principle, and again I'm not being conspiratorial, that the United States is applying in Europe through the Marshall Plan. What is the United States primarily interested in in the post-war period? How do we take these destroyed countries? And turn them rapidly into nations that can buy American produce, take American investment, and be part of a global free trade market. The only problem with that, of course, is that Australia of all the developing countries feels itself to be particularly vulnerable. Again, we come back to agriculture and an old patterns of industrial protection that are simply not competitive in that regime. So, what I'm talking about here, I suppose is just a long process of Australia seeking to. Feed into international negotiations, a series of principles that recognise the difference between developed, developing and underdeveloped nations, and this will be an agenda that flows in to uh to uh later lectures. And it has to be said, one of the things that, you know, we can, as talking from an Australian perspective, be quietly proud of is Australia proved remarkably effective in making this case, because one of the things that Australia starts doing in the 1940s is speaking into these forums as a developing country. We are vulnerable. We cannot play the same game as the big powers. Our natural allies maybe are in with other developing countries, other countries that need to protect their manufacturing before they can openly compete. And you start to see in this period a phenomenon that has will become increasingly characteristic of Australian economic diplomacy into the 50s and 60s, the ways in which when we seek to represent ourselves, we are seeking to represent that middle band, that middle power, those of you who are doing international relations will be familiar with that concept, that middle power strategy where the agendas are quite different. And we do have some success in writing these kinds of modifications into the general agreements of tariffs of trade, the International Monetary Fund, and so on. People often say, what is this thing about the, about the sterling area, so Australia is seeking to maintain the integrity of the British pound. Why? Because it's still not just a matter of sentiment, that's the post-World War II sterling area. OK, it's the old empire, but it's also a whole lot of areas, a whole lot of nations, a whole lot of common interests that are a sense seeking to stand apart from what they see as the heavy hand of American free marketeering. And we are still, and we will still, well into the 1950s, be defined by our adherence to the United Kingdom. You can see that in the Second World War, of course we shift to the United States. We're very dependent on them, so much of that stuff comes in by Lendlease.
