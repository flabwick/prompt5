SPEAKER 1
Yeah, you'll need to keep a focused on so that's good. I think that's ready to go. And we're ready to go. Good, good. OK, um, well, welcome everyone, uh, I have much pleasure in introducing uh Professor Nicholas Brown. Uh, Nick is a leading historian of 20th century Australia, um, with a particular expertise in, uh, political and administrative and cultural history from the 19, I'd say what, 1930s through to the 1970s, so very much uh uh mid mid 20th century in particular, but with many other strings to his bow, one of which is that, uh, in other years he has been the convenor and main uh lecturer in this course, so, uh, he knows what it's all about, uh, and uh we're very um very privileged to have him here today, so. Um, without further ado, Nicks on post-war reconstruction, this is on the domestic aspects. Uh, there is a, a, a lecture scheduled on the international aspects of that for, um, next week, but we're, we've, I'm very privileged to have, um, such a, a leading historian in this area, uh, uh, talking to us today.

SPEAKER 2
So thank you, it's a real pleasure to be here. I, I. I, I really enjoy teaching this course. I think it's a very important course in terms of the synthesis that we're trying to develop, um, and I suppose, um, I, one of the issues I suppose that often comes up for histo historians have a kind of a preoccupation with issues of periodization, and one of the courses, one of the issues I suppose that often occurs to me in teaching this course is how might you periodize Australian economic history. And that will be something perhaps for you to reflect on, I'm sure you already have, but as as the semester goes on. I mean there there are obvious options. There's the kind of the pre 1788, post 1788 starting point, uh, that takes you right back to your first discussions. I suppose and there's the 1840s, the ending of convict transportation, I suppose the first major depression that hits Australia, then there's the the 1850s, the gold rushes. Uh, the 1880s and the 1890s, again, that kind of exposure to a sudden infusion of international investment and that major world depression that has particular impacts for the kinds of vulnerabilities that Australia has towards the end of the 19th century. Maybe there's 1901 and all of those kinds of new social experiments, new protections and nation building and so on that follows on from that. Those of you often kind of think, actually know the real turning point in Australian economic history is sometime around the 1980s. It's the kind of the Hawke-Keating experiments when all of that old inheritance is pushed to one side, central to that old inheritance, and I suppose from my perspective. Is the turning point that is really marked by the 1940s and by everything that is associated with post-war reconstruction, and I really want to draw out that today and perhaps suggest why it is that that turning point has particular salience. Um, I'm assuming, uh, well, I, just to recap in yesterday's lecture dealing with the huge, the unprecedented impact of the Second World War, many of the issues that I just kind of want to recap will be familiar to you now. I mean, at a really basic level, when you look at the Second World War, you were looking at the mass mobilisation of people into jobs after 20 years really of chronic instability and uncertainty in the Australian economy. So all of a sudden along comes an impetus. Now there is something urgent for you to do, framed by that concept of total war. This is not, again, the the the standard contrast is drawn between World War 1 and World War 2. What do we do in World War 1? Really crudely, we send a lot of men overseas to die. Whereas in in the Second World War, what we build are new manufacturing capacities, new investment, new mobilizations of population, a new way of thinking about the Australian continent, the Australian resources, which is not just about what can we offer to Europe, but what can we represent for ourselves, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, and for those reasons, that kind of mobilisation of resources, that's one of the big changes that I think. During this period, particularly again, as you know, coming out of the uncertainty that the chronic crisis of the 1930s and really the uncertainties that prevailed for the two decades between the two world wars, and you can see both the immediate impact. I mean, what is the word there? What are the unessential industries? We don't need those for the sake of the war economy. We have absolute things that we must do. So the unessential stuff gets pushed back for a time, we'll focus on what are those priorities. And will mobilise people into those jobs, so there's the immediate crisis of the Second World War, but I'm sure you're familiar with this table, it's sometimes worthwhile coming back to. There are those things that clearly shift. In the 1940s and will stay shifted well until the 1970s. So whatever it is that turns around in the in the 1940s in association with the Second World War and you can see it there in terms of unemployment rates, stays shifted for a long period of time. What we're looking at is what the great historian Eric Hobsbaum would call the beginning of the golden age. Particularly for the Western powers, but he would argue with not equal access, but most emerging established new nations in the world from 190 from the 1940s through to the 1970s experienced unprecedented levels of access to resources, access to economic security, and I'll come back to that in a later lecture when I'll be looking at the, Uh, the, the, the years of prosperity in Australia from the 1950s and 1960s, but, but there you have it. Whatever is tracking through that period in terms of security in employment stays there. So we're not just looking at a mobilisation of resources. Under the pressure of war we're looking at arguably some significant structural changes. So let's look at that table and again the ways in which what is marked by the 1940s are some really profound shifts in terms of where people are working. A rise in manufacturing from the 1930s onwards, a relative decline beginning in the 1930s but really precipitating from the Second World War onwards in agriculture. I'll come back to this again, this is employment by industry. This is not necessarily saying these industries are becoming less significant. Partly what's going on in agriculture is it is one of those industries that really benefits from investment in technology. Investment in rethinking the kind of services that you might make available to regional regional Australia, that partly comes out of the Second World War. If we have to defend this continent, how are we going to defend places where we don't even have stable road networks? We can't even get the stuff there, and of course the rise in services. So again, what's shifting in this period is not just the immediate impact of the Second World War, but it is some larger structural changes. Structural shifts. The rise of services employment, agriculture, less labour intensive, more mechanised. The rise of manufacturing, and you'll be familiar with that. I know from the lecture on the Second World War yesterday, I'll be picking them up in on next Tuesday and in my lecture on the 1950s. Well, that's one thing. What might be another thing? Uh, well, this is kind of topical in a way, isn't it, the turn to the United States. I mean, we're very familiar with John Curtin's 1941, Pearl harbour is bombed, the Japanese are coming without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it quite clear Australia looks to America. That's often characterised as a strategic odd, we need somebody to look after us kind of choice. But what followed on from that and what would endure arguably until somewhere round about now, was a long-term shift to, I wouldn't characterise it as dependency. We'll discuss that. I'm sure you will discuss that, but certainly an increasingly tight relationship with the United States. Uh, it's a structural and economic choice as well as a a a military strategic choice that has been made. And again, it's, it's simply the fact that in the Second World War there are lots of Americans here. Uh, in mid 1943, 150,000 American soldiers are here. Why are they here? Because Australia becomes the base, first Melbourne, then Brisbane, from which the United States allied strategic command for the Pacific region is based. General Douglas MacArthur is first in Melbourne, in case the north northern Australia falls, then he moves up to Brisbane. With him come those soldiers who are being fed, requisitioned, looked after, R&R famously, I'll get to that shortly, no, I probably won't, uh, before they are deployed into the north. By the end of 1943, a quarter of a million Americans are stationed in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Now it's not just that they're oversexed, overpaid over here, they represent a new phenomenon. They're well, they are well paid, they bring everything that American modernity looked like in the 1930s, Hollywood, smartly pressed clothes, good wages, better education. The average American serviceman going into the Second World War was a well educated kind of guy, much better educated than an Australian soldier pushed into those same circumstances. By the end of 1944, 2/3 of Australia's imports came from the United States. So this is the beginning of a really close association with the United States. Why is it occurring? I'm sorry, my PowerPoint there's got a bit staggered. Well, it's partly because of course Britain, is no longer there for us. Secondly, because the United States, Roosevelt wanted to get involved in war in Europe, Congress was not very happy until it became absolutely clear that German submarines were going to target any US merchant ships that were supplying Britain. So in 1941 before the United States has entered the war before Pearl harbour, Roosevelt introduces the Lend Lease Acts. Initially to benefit Britain, but what this means, don't worry, I'm going to move on fairly quickly, but what this means is that from 1941 onwards as Australia becomes involved in the Pacific campaign with the United States, a lot of United States equipment and war material is coming in to Australia. This is, those figures are just from Townsville. Now I'm gonna talk more about the international dimension next Tuesday, but that is an American presence and it's not just that those machines are moving through, it's that the parts are coming, the skills are coming, the technology is coming, the investment is coming. The rethinking what being involved with American modernity might look like, is here, and you can see it. And it's a value to us, total US wartime aid to Australia was 285 million pounds. You've got the figure there roughly in Australian dollars now. Now, years ago I taught a course with our American historian Doug Craig, who would rather cruelly say, look, is it any wonder Australia chose the United States? That's the kind of car you would be buying in Britain at the end of the Second World War. That's the kind of car. You would be buying in the United States at the end of the Second World War. Now really, if you were going to choose, which would you go for? And my suggestion is it's not just a question of styling, size, and so on. It is a question of what does Britain represent the past and what does America represent the future. Uh, that is an American bulldozer that was brought out here to help clear past through the jungle of Papua New Guinea. That stayed here at the end of the Second World War because Australia was very reluctant to return this stuff. Lendlease was always ambiguous. Do you send it back when you don't need it anymore, how much do you pay for it? Well, why don't we take that and use it to clear large parts of Brigalow country in Queensland to turn them into farms for returning servicemen. Farms that will be systematically cleared so they can be more efficiently managed as mechanised units. Than what they were before the Second World War, so that's just a simple indication of, you know what this kind of shift meant. There is an idealism behind it, and I suppose post-war reconstruction immediately raises that issue. Why do, why do we care about post-war reconstruction? Why really in just about every Western country, every allied country during this period, does the concept of post-war reconstruction come to mind? Well, there is a kind of an idealistic reason behind it. The world, I'm sorry, I'm a bit on guard with you, the world went to shit in 1931. We were not even sure we were going to get through. We had areas of industrial crisis, militancy, unprecedented, and all of a sudden we have to turn to those same populations and say, I'm sorry it was so hard for you, but now you have to fight for us. So what often lay behind post-war reconstruction was a really genuine concern of what are we going to offer these people, that means that the world that they get at the end of this war is not the same as the world that they got at the end of the last one. So sitting behind that there really is a morale factor. How do we make this war worth fighting? And again, I'm not pushing United States barrow here, but I am suggesting the ways in which the language of thinking about what a post-war world might look like, is there at the heart of post-war reconstruction. So again, as a condition really of the United States under Roosevelt, even beginning to think about the ways in which it might become involved in the Second World War, he sits down in the middle of the Atlantic with Winston Churchill and says, OK, I want to get your commitment to a series of principles. It's called the Atlantic Charter. Uh, and it's not a bad idea to go through it because it does again indicate what the shift of economic and political gravity to the United States will look like. So, OK, there will be no territorial gains sought by us or by you at the end of the Second World War. That's kind of code for, you know, those things you've got called colonies. It's over. Territorial adjustments must be in accord with the wishes of the people concerned. All people had a right to self-determination. Now you might say this is really golden American rhetoric. When did they actually practise what they preached, but nonetheless it's there. And it leads to that next point, trade barriers will be lowered. I'm gonna touch on this next Tuesday, but as you know, through the interwar period, Australia has protected itself from import competition from the United States. We can't come in here. We don't want you, we've got tariffs against you, sounds familiar. So Roosevelt is saying, you know, if we're going to fight alongside you, you get rid of those tariff barriers, you let us come into your space. There was to be global economic cooperation and advancement of social welfare, so a social agenda is becoming central to this. The participants would work for a world free of want and fear, I'll leave it at that. But what I'm suggesting is that even in the Atlantic Charter, there are some big principles about a better world, but those principles about a better world are also framed by, we will really need to rethink the economic fundamentals sitting underneath those processes. So I suppose I'm trying to draw out the strategic, economic, the structural shifts. As I'm sure Frank would have emphasised yesterday, there are significant political shifts as well. labour in Australia is in government. Uh, And labour in government, having had no chance to do anything in that brief interlude under Scullin at the at the heart of the Great Depression is really inevitably driven by a sense of what would a political agenda look like that a labour government might push through at this opportunity. Yes, we have to fight a war. But what are we fighting a war for? In a wonderful book, I think you've got the excerpt from it, from its introduction as part of your reading for this for this week's tutorials. Stuart McIntyre's title is Australia's Boldest experiment. And the book is really driven by the fact that at no point, before or really since, did you have a government that was so committed to a comprehensive rethinking of what some of the basic structures underpinning Australian governance, social policy and economic policy might look like. And it's exemplified I suppose, inevitably in kind of hero figures. Whenever I catch the bus into university I go past this statue of um of of by Peter Corlett, 2011 of uh Ben Chifley and John Curtin walking to work. And I don't know, I really like it because it's based on a real photograph every morning as Curtin as as Prime Minister and Chifley as his as his treasurer, walked to work and spoke about the mess that the world was in and what Australia might hope to get out of that mess, and there's a a kind of informality, there's a kind of camaraderie, there's a kind of austerity about them both. And it's true It's true in relation to the kind of point that Stuart McIntyre draws out. Both Curtin and Chifley were fairly left wing aligned radical trade union leaders from the 1920s and the 1930s. The First World War, as I'm sure Frank might have mentioned, Curtin opposed conscription. One of the things that he had to introduce reluctantly in the Second World War was conscription. For service in defence of Australian territories. The curtain was always saying while people were pushing this post-war reconstruction agenda, now come on, wait a minute, we've got to win the war first. These wonderful ideas, you've got, first, you know, it's fight, what is it, fight, work. Or die, I think it's too cunt, but it, that was his message. I mean he was a really pragmatic guy. They're not going to squander the benefits of office, it's really hard for labour to get into government and they are fighting a war, a war at an unprecedented scale. Chifley is as treasurer. He's interested in these ideas about post-war reconstruction, but he's also a treasurer and he's also famously a very austere man. You can go, I think, still to the Hotel Kurrajong and visit the room in which he slept, and there's kind of nothing in it but a bed, a chair, a little mash tray for his pipe. He looked very closely at what are you spending this money on? Why are you spending it on that? I don't have lots of money here, I've got to balance the books. Thought of, because one of the shifts that's just about to happen is that shift from a kind of an accountancy-based view of what fighting a war might look like to a Keynesian view. But still, there's that concern about don't push us too far, don't make us so unpopular again because everybody thinks we're socialists that we'll get turfed out. So the idealism, I think this is partly Stuart McIntyre's point, the idealism is always tinged by the pragmatism of these guys who are saying, yes, there is a war, and secondly we need to be very careful because we're not really sure that people like us that much. We know they don't like Menzies, but we've seen so often, time and time again how the other side will edge its way back in. And this might seem a little bit self-indulgent, but one of the great things that happened, because I've written a book about Canberra, uh, and I've lived here all my life, sort of. One of the, one of the things we need to remind ourselves of is that Canberra at the Second World War is nowhere. Most government departments are still in Melbourne. The First World War was fought from Melbourne because Parliament did not move to Canberra until 1927, and as soon as the politicians could get out of here they did because there's nothing here. That's the Hotel Kurrajong in 1939 from which, Chifley walked to Parliament House, and that's Parliament House, round about the same time, and that's an aerial photograph, pretty much of the the centre of the city as it existed in 1942. Uh, over there is where the ANU now is. There's nothing here. But one of the things that's changes through this period is that Canberra actually starts to matter, because if you're going to fight a war, if you're going to base that war on the massive mobilisation of all national resources, and if you're going to start needing to draw on a new kind of expertise to do it in economic management specifically, then people are going to need to come here and national government will matter. Now I'm not sure that's very clear because I had to photocopy it from old books, but that's, yeah, those are the government departments in existence in 1939. Those are the government departments in existence in 1952. The role of the Commonwealth government, the specific allocation of those roles, the portfolios change fundamentally. These are Commonwealth portfolios in 1901, these are 1939, these are 1956. So at a very basic level, what you've got is a a significant expansion in the specialised areas that government is dealing with. So you've got that, you've also got the kind of people who are going to be drawn into those roles. And these are just some names you don't need to worry about them except the point behind those names is these are the names of a generation, and they were a distinct generation of university educated, most of them in economics, most of them scholarship boys. Who found their way to government in the late 1930s, early 1940s because government said we need experts. And they stayed, again, this goes back to the point, what we're looking at in this period is not the contingency of war, this is consolidation of careers. And careers that are invested in a particular kind of vision of what nation building might look like. There's a great book published by the Australian Dictionary of Biography. Here you can get it online, on that side of the page. This is a significant infusion of expertise. Up until 1939, the Commonwealth Public Service was based on the principle of seniority. You came in as a postboy, you worked your way up. And it was based on a kind of really basic notion of what does the Commonwealth government do when it administers. It looks after the budget, it hands out the paper clips, to put it really crudely. What 1939 does is it says we need university graduates. We need expertise. We need people, unfortunately they are all men who have the capacity to manage this massive expansion of the state. And not only that, on this side of the show, these are the personalities, these are the people, they became really powerful figures. The book is partly called The Dwarfs, because one characteristic most of them had was that they're really, really short. Why? I'm not sure, um. But they were. Margaret Coombs, I'll be talking about him shortly. I think we'll just about that high, after whom the Coombs Building is named, John Crawford, I think slightly taller, about that high. Richard Randall, I used to know cos he lived opposite the side opposite where I grew up, except I didn't know him because he couldn't understand a word he said. He was shorter still, he was about that tall. But it was part of the the mystique of these men. And they have extraordinary power, so one of the first things that the Commonwealth government does in under as as under pressure of war is seek to get control over taxation revenue because we have a lot of things we need to do very quickly. So as you can see, not only is taxation much lower until the 1940s, but taxation is much more a state's matter. Particularly in areas such as income taxation, but what in 1942, the government says as a wartime measure we will take control of pretty much all indirect income tax, that kind of taxation, and you can see this is that spike and it never goes away. The the state government's protested, but actually no government really wants to take full responsibility for taxation. Oh, that's, it's Canberra that does it, but nonetheless, this is a profound shift. So not only are these people powerful in their intellects, if you like, but they've also got increasing control over the government's revenue. So what do they do with it? Well, one of the central things that they do with it is think about what might the future look like, where should we invest, what are the things that matter, and to pursue that process, in 1942, a formal ministry of post-war reconstruction was established. There had been earlier little think tanks, but again the government certainly Chifley, was very reluctant to create a new department because it's gonna step on the, you know, all of these guys have got territory. I'm in Treasury, I'm in attorney General, I'm in external affairs. I'm a prime minister and cabinet. And now you're telling me there's this new department called post-war reconstruction that's gonna do what? Tell me what to do, I don't like it. So this is Ngart Coombs, Chifley was the first minister, he was the first director general, it was called again, even there, the department is choosing a particular kind of terminology. Coombs said we don't want to antagonise other departments. We don't want to be a policy department, we want to be a thinking department, we want to be a temporary department. He had no intention that post-war reconstruction would last. What he did have as an intention was that post-war reconstruction would shift the terms of the debate, and it would establish a cohort of experts who would then be diffused out into the established departments and changed the future functions of government. If you like, you can just go over the hill there to the old Canberra Hospital, which is still on the Canberra on the university campus, and that was the Department of Post-war instruction. Not a particularly auspicious place, no office in Canberra was particularly auspicious, it was just temporary stuff. So that's where post-war reconstruction was, but it had this aura. These people are experts who are framing a vision of what it is we should be doing. They're not alone, through this, through this period, again with the background of the Second World War in mind. Uh, there is already a joint parliamentary committee on social security that is saying we know there are some really big issues of social deprivation out there that we need to address. So as a kind of a parallel enterprise, this committee is engaging in research on those kinds of topics, and it's not a bad kind of list of topics to look through. What should the Commonwealth government's position be on issues like social security planning, uh, unemployment, OK, and the more emergency. But what if we think about unemployment in the longer term? What about we think about reconstruction planning? What about if we consolidate all of those areas of social welfare under some kind of control of the government? What should housing policy look like? Again, I'll come back to this shortly, but housing was a bit of an issue then, as it is now, but the issue with housing then was that pretty much nothing had been built. For 10 years. Chronic housing shortage, how do you address it, not so much that it was impossibly expensive, it just didn't exist. What would a comprehensive health service look like? What if we said people have a basic entitlement to healthcare debate now about, you know, should children have access to dental care? Should old people have access to dental care? What should these, so these, these issues are there, they're in the air. And they are resulting in significant legislation, so the Menzies government before uh before it collapse, introduces a scheme of child endowment, uh, which is partly funded through taxation revenue. In 1942, 1 of the first things introduced by the Curtin government was widow's pensions, maternity benefits, even extending to Aboriginal people. Benefits that are paid directly to women, rather than by the wage earner. Because there's a recognition often that it's going to be women whose family circumstances might be such that they are caring for the child, not in a mediated way through a husband, funeral benefits. You have a right to a basically frugal but nonetheless a proper uh uh uh way of burying your dead and so on. So these are significant initiatives in the establishment of a Commonwealth employment service in 1945. So they're in the air. And they're reflecting a kind of a, a continuation of let's, to put it really crudely, 1930s kind of a mediaarism. We know there are areas of suffering. We know there are areas that the government should be involved in. One of the famous pathbreaking reports was in Britain. It was commit commissioned by Sir William Beveridge at the London School of Economics who largely took it on as his own initiative, Social Insurance and Allied Services, and his argument was that surely if we've learned anything. And is really conscious of the declining social status of most British people at the end of the 1930s, there should be a social standard below which no one should be allowed to fall, a basic minimum. The government should should find ways of fighting the five giant evils want, disease, ignorance, squalor, and idleness. And again I think you can see that that language is kind of revealing, it's kind of morally charged, should not be idle. It's, it's, it's kind of, it's ethically charged, uh, you, you shouldn't live in squalor, it's, it's benevolently charged, you shouldn't be ignorant. But then again, something kind of happens. The next report that Beveridge writes, full employment in a free society. And even there I think you can see there's a shift in the language. This is about a minimum below which no one should be allowed to fall. This is about the role of the state in guaranteeing a high and stable level of employment. And my argument. would be that that is a radical shift in the ways in which social policy is being understood, but more significantly, it's a radical shift in the ways in which the role of government as an economic regulator is being understood. This is stepping to address poverty. This is run the economy so that everybody has a job. And that is a profound difference. Now you know where it comes from. I suppose you, I mean, you would have touched on, Keynes's 1936 general theory of employment interest in May. Now I don't have time to go through this. You're economist, you'll make, you know this much better than I can. I mean, the general theory is essentially a response to the Great Depression. What is Keynes's argument, uh, the central, we need central controls to bring about an adjustment between the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest. That is what will get us out of this mess is if we stimulate consumption. If we stimulate demand because at that kind of expenditure will generate jobs, will generate investment, so what is the point, to put it really crudely, of allowing people to sit lost in unemployment until wages fall so low that people are prepared to employ them again when what we should be doing is ensuring that employed people get out there and spend to stimulate recovery. So that is a response to depression. The marginal propensity to consume is greatest in the lower income groups, who spends most of the money in their pockets? People who don't have a lot of money in their pockets. People who don't, you know, I need to spend what I've got this week to get through the week. So it's to put it crudely, the working class who will spend more of the money in their pockets, so maybe it's that kind of reallocation, redistribution of wealth, but Keynes he's always very careful about how he uses those kinds of words that matters. And here we have him again, Coombs as an economist in the 1930s is kind of turned on by this. The old economics just said you can't do anything, just wait for the market to pick people up. But all of a sudden, as Coombs put it, the publication of the of the general theory was for me and for many of my generation, the most seminal intellectual event of our time. It enabled us to rethink what, Government could do through regulating the economy. But then along comes the Second World War. And Keynes published in 1940 a small book called How to Pay for the War. And I'm looking at my watch and realising that I'm already running out of time, but here is the next kind of shift in the problem that is always present in Keynesian economics. Because Keynes's basic proposition in how in how to pay for the war is, OK, in 1946, I told you how to get out of depression. By stimulating consumption, but now we're engaged in a total war, and the biggest problem with the total war is that if you consume stuff, you will minimise the capacity of the government to direct it to it's where it's really needed. And you will also threaten to force up the price of those commodities that are in scarce supply. So the big, you know, what the problem identified in the general theory was deflation. The problem that is identified and how to pay for the war is inflation. How do we, so what Keynes proposed in how to pay for the war was, we now need to use taxation much more subtly to what he called defer earnings. Take money out of people's pockets. Promising them, again, this is post-war reconstruction, but at the end of the war, you know, you'll get it back. You'll get it back in some other form, you mightn't get it back as income, but you'll get it back as social services, you'll get it back in improved education, you'll get it back in some form, but now you can't spend it. Because we need it for other things, and if you spend it, you'll bring inflation into the system. So this is the other side of the Keynesian proposition. Both need to be seen together. And it becomes a real debate within the processes that that I'm that that I want to draw your attention to. So the heart of the Keynesian revolution in Australia is often identified as a small group of people sitting over there in East Block just behind our our Parliament House called the Financial and Economic Committee. First associated with the Department of supply, they were set up to come up with schemes about how the government might manage a Japanese embargo on shipping. Let's just say nothing can get through. What are we going to do? In 1940, advising the government, LF Giblin, the leading economist in this period, was still saying, look, there is enough slack in the economy, we've still got enough people unemployed, we've still got enough stuff that we need to get done, but let's borrow a bit more money to stimulate that kind of consumption and start getting people mobilised and partly have a psychological imperative in mind. How do we make people prepared to fight for the war, because we're not, we're not going to be happy to fight if we just keep penalising them. But even then, Treasury and by 1942 Treasury has taken over the running of the Financial and Economic Committee is saying, you know what, there is actually more money in people's pockets than you're allowing, and we need to get that money out of people's pockets because they're going to cause inflationary inflationary pressures. And again I suppose I'm suggesting that's a really neat little symbol. You've got Giblin saying we can use government largesse for want of a better word, to to to stimulate a better balance between morale, the allocation of resources, and you've got Treasury saying no, our problem is inflation. The big problem is inflation, and we need to tax those people adequately to get it out of their pockets. This debate comes to a real head, and I think you've got the excerpt from the white paper on full employment in your reading for this week. So the white paper on full employment is, if you like, a manifesto. Do they have it in their reading? So I'm, I'm gonna skip over this really quickly. You'll be struck, you know, what the white paper on the one hand is saying is that, uh, you know, look, in the worst years of the depression over 20% of the workforce was in unproductive idleness. You can see that's where the beverage language is there. On the other hand, the policy outlined in this paper is that governments should accept the responsibility of stimulating spending and goods and services to the extent necessary to sustain full employment. That tension is going to run through debates for the next 30 years. The fine management of where people's money goes, how much money they have to spend, how you might adjust taxation rates. Because you're no longer, you've no longer got a treasury that is thinking in terms of accountancy, going back to the kind of Niemar exchange, how much money have you got to spend this year? You've got, you've got a treasury that is thinking if you spend that on that, he's not going to be able to spend it on this. If the public sector does this, the private sector will be pushed out. So the language of the white paper is idealistic. Uh, before the war, not all those available for work were able to find employment, uh, but look what we did during the war, everybody had a job, so why can't we do it in peace? But then the, you know, the, the Keynesian argument be that what you are always sitting on is the tiger of inflation. So there are economic and political problems at the heart of the Keynesian embargo. When in 1944 the government sought to pass a referendum that meant that a number of powers that it had acquired, As wartime measures could be carried over into the post-war management of the economy, and again that's a pretty significant list of powers. Look, we've got these capacities as wartime measures to manage society and the economy. They are sufficiently important that we should be allowed to carry them over into peace. The referendum was defeated. Again, Stuart McIntyre's argument would be that already by 1944, a reaction is starting to occur. People are starting to feel they're being pushed around. They're being controlled, they're being over rationed, they're being told what to do, they're being allocated jobs and so on. They don't want a government stepping into these highly regulated spaces. They are, however, happy for a government that manages budget adjustments. So in a sense, the 14 powers referendum is indicative, even as early as 1944, of a debate about where that political imagination, How might we lock these kinds of broader social agendas into a a a government programme, are starting to be trimmed back. Some people would argue that in a way, somebody like Chifley Curtain, always anxious about looking like socialists. Eva out the front is saying, well, if we don't do this, we're not gonna do nothing, what's the point? And as I point out, he makes the same kind of case at an international sphere. So again, there's an interdependency between the two. But that 1944 powers referendum is significant for that reason. What the government is doing to support those kinds of things is that from 1942 onwards it introduced what was called a national welfare fund, and the National Welfare fund was justified by saying, OK, we're going to lower thresholds of taxation, so down further into lower levels of income, and we're going to use that money to support Commonwealth government programmes in a range of areas. But actually they never spent that money on those purposes, partly because it was always intended in a kind of Keynesian way to manage consumption. And by the time you get into the 1950s and 19, 1940s, 1950s, the inflationary concern is more powerful. So selling what was seen to be a welfare agenda becomes more a taxation management agenda. But in the 5 minutes I've got left, I just quickly want to go through what might well then be the kind of standout features of the enduring aspects of post-war reconstruction. You've got all of those men fighting. When they came back from the First World War, they were lost, they were put, as you know, on farms that didn't work. Why don't we give them skills? Why don't we give them education? Why don't we help them to go to universities if they want to? The Commonwealth Reconstruction training scheme was very effective in giving that generation of returned servicemen access to retraining. Soldier settlement was smaller in scale and much better planned during this period, so there are the same ideas, but they're backed by again you can see it there civil rehabilitation centre. How can we help you get back into the economy as a worker? There are problems, you know, that's victory. These men are damaged. All of a sudden, the language of what social welfare might look like is starting to be shaped by a sense of neurosis, damage, suffering. There's also a sense of, well, you know, what the father's gone through, somehow or other we need to shift on to another generation, so you know, our son. We need to give access to education. Our son is the future. Sorry man, you're out of it. You didn't have a job through the 1930s, you fought the Second World War, lovely, but now the future is in the kind of austere provision. Be a saver, not a spender, help keep prices down so your kid can be supported to go through education. It's a real shift again in the agenda, the value of individual education. I'm going to be really self-indulgent here. That's my father in 191,940, just before he went off to Papua New Guinea to fight where he stayed for the next 5 years. That's when he came back and I'm still kind of arrested by the shift between that face of a 20-year-old and that face of a 25-year-old who has bayoneted Japanese. And that's Dad. In his suit, in his city uniform, and I remember saying to Dad, why didn't you take up the CRT CRT CRT Commonwealth Reconstruction training scheme off? and he said, Of course Nick, I had no fucking idea what I was gonna do. I was so damaged by that war, yeah, you can say you can rebuild your life. But I had no idea what my life might look like after 5 years fighting that war, and it might be self-indulgence, but he's not alone. And it is part of that point, I think that we're going to be looking at in the 1950s. What is the past we want to leave behind. There are similar schemes in relation to women, you know, women are in the workforce. How do you manage a woman? You know, they, they're tricky things, they're emotional, they're, you know, very difficult to manage, have to be subtle. Uh, avoid horseplay or kinning, kidding, she might represent it. Suggest rather than reprimand. When she does a good job, tell her so, this is how you keep a woman in the workforce. One for the time that you want her in the workforce. In 1943 as part of the whole kind of reconstruction ideal, a group of women got together saying, well, OK, this is what you asked us to do for for war, what about for victory? And these are the kinds of things that were in the women's charter that were passed in 1943, and it's an interesting kind of list of these are the gains that women thought might be consolidated coming out of the war, principle of equality. For women to be fully employed in official capacities in planning development, communities.
