OK, uh, it's 5, after the hour, so we'll get a start. Welcome back, everyone. It's good to see you all. Um, and once again, I mean, I really should be handing back part of my salary, I guess, because we have a, a guest lecturer tonight, said Professor David Lee, from University of New South Wales, Canberra, or is ADFA, as we used to call it. Now David is, uh, uh, we're very fortunate once again because David is a, a leading, Historian of, um, uh, minerals booms of, um, the, uh, you know, basically the, uh, post-war international order. And so David's talking about the mining booms in this lecture, and, uh, we're, uh, very grateful for that. And, um, Dave, I think you're coming back also, were you talking about post-war reconstruction as well, I think, at one point. Sorry. Yeah, anyway, that's, that's that's that's fine, yeah, so look, anyway, um, so David will be talking about the, the, the minerals boom and uh uh I'm sure he'll be pleased to, to take any perhaps questions right at the end if there's time to do that. So thanks again, David.

SPEAKER 2
Thanks very much. So today we'll talk about. Australia's mineral booms in the. 20th century and 21st century. Um So a, a, a question we can ask is why did Australia prosper, benefit from, Uh, Mining in the second half of the 20th century, and the first two decades of our century. Just some, just some uh dates so you can situate. The content of this lecture. Um, The period of Bretton Woods capitalism or regimented capitalism is another word for it, goes from 1944 with the with the Bretton Woods Agreement, which established the International Monetary Fund and goes until 1971. Uh, Capitalism undergoes a change thereafter when the Americans take the dollar off gold. The international long boom goes broadly from around about 1950 to 1973, that's when the West, Western economies really prosper after the setbacks of the inner war years and and the Second World War. This coincides the long boom with the first Australian mining boom. Which can be dated from about 1960 up until 1972. Then we have an uh an interlude and then another boom, the resources boom from 1976 to 1982. We have another, I suppose, um, period of slump in mining or or low prices for minerals in the, 80s and 90s, but we have another bigger boom, the China boom, from 2001 to about 2 2013. And just before that, the global financial crisis. But just to to set Australia's 20th century and 21st century mining booms in context, Um, Australia's colonial economic history. Was featured by. Earlier mining booms, particularly the biggest of them, the gold rushes. Which were phenomenal in Victoria, but they also um extended to New South Wales, and thereafter to Queensland, and then later in the late 19th century and into the 20th century in Western Australia. So, so gold is is a a a very important uh part of the story of Australian economic history. And of Australia's prosperity in the colonial period. Apart from Western Australia, gold tapers off in the 20th century, and mining generally tapers off too. In the sense that, just to take one example, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company or BHP, you've all heard of that. BHP started off as a mining company mining silver and lead and zinc at Broken Hill in New South Wales, so it starts off as a mining company. But transitions in the early 20th century into a uh manufacturer, manufacturer of steel. Uh, which was made from iron ore in South Australia and coking coal in New South Wales. So BHP transitions from a miner to a manufacturer. Then later it goes back to mining in the second half of the 20th century. The colonial period was was a period of prosperity from other commodities like wool, becomes a staple in the in the colonial period and into the 20th century. It's Australia's biggest commodity export right up until uh the late 60s, early 70s. And the the novel Great Expectations gives us an example of a convict who goes out to Australia and gets rich by virtue of wool growing. Now you, you may have touched on the Australian settlement, so with Federation in 1901, the colonies come together in 1901 to form the Commonwealth of Australia. And after the the um establishment of the Commonwealth, there's a set of policies that are uh come with federation, including white Australia, that's a discriminatory immigration policy, a a preference for British and European settlers, and an exclusion of Asians and people from the Pacific islands. Tariff protection is um a settled policy from that period, so protectionist tariffs are used. Wage arbitration is also a component of the Australian settlement, as is state paternalism, so governments are are both Commonwealth and state are active. And all this is under the umbrella of the British Empire. So the first half of the 20th century sees mining going into decline. And the Australian economy undergoes some turbulent times after after a boom in the 1920s, after the disruption of the First World War, you get the Great Depression of the 1930s, which is a decade-long period of high unemployment relative to other periods, um, and a a a a general slump in the, in the, um, output of the economy. And throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Um, Australia has to balance its trade with a limited number of of rural exports like wool and wheat, and, and with the proceeds of those exports to buy imports. It didn't have enough money from these exports to pay for the imports, which meant that it had to licence imports right through the 1950s to balance its trade. And there's a general debate about some people think the Australian settlement was actually the wrong thing to do, they say we should have had more liberal free trade policies, that's disputed by other historians, but it's an interesting argument to have a look at. Now when we talk about, Mining in Australia going into a general kind of period of lassitude or a period of um, Um, of relative slump in terms of the gold rushes of the 19th century. Um, one of the stories behind this is the iron ore embargo. So we did, Australia had iron ore in South Australia, which BHP used to make steel. Uh, iron ore was also discovered at a place called Yampi Sound off north west coast of Western Australia. Anyone been there or know where it is? Yampi Sound. There were iron ore deposits there. Which interested the Japanese in the 1930s, so the Japanese wanted to get access to the, the, these iron ore deposits to make its own steel. This was at a time when Japan was at war with China. Now what happens is that the Lyons government in 1938 gets nervous about the prospect of Japan gaining a foothold at Yampi Sound. It commissions its chief geologist to to to to do a survey of Australia's iron ore resources, and he concludes that Australia's accessible iron ore resources or deposits in South Australia and in Western Australia. These are the ones they knew about then. He says they're not enough um for for Australia to to be able to export. They have to be conserved because they're limited in in number for our own industry. Our own steel making industry. This induces the Lyon's government to embargo iron ore, so no Australian iron ore is to be sold overseas from 1938, and this doctrine that we have limited deposits of iron ore lasts for another 20 years. It seems absurd now when Australia is now one of the biggest, if not the biggest iron ore exporter in the world, but back then that's what they thought. Now by the Turn of the 1950s and 1960s. The Menzies government, Robert Menzies here decides he's going to try and experiment to get rid of import licencing. So remember they've licenced imports because they can't balance their trade with the limited amount of rural exports that they have. So essentially we don't export much except wool, which is our predominant export back then, and other commodities, wheat, meat, etc. and a a limited number of um mining um exports, but, but not much. It's really substantially rural. Anyway, in 1960 people are getting sick of import licences, the Liberal Party's agitating for Menzies to get rid of import licencing. And he gets rid of them. As soon as he gets rid of the import licencing, there's a balance of payments crisis. Um, so this induces the government to um introduce credit squeeze measures to try and dampen the economy, to control the balance of payments crisis, which leads to unemployment. Now we're talking about a fairly modest level of unemployment back then, 2 or 3%. But that's at at a time when Australians had been experiencing full employment, and it really upset um Australians, particularly in Queensland, and they almost voted Menzies out. In 1961. He survives by the skin of his teeth in the 1961 election. But one of the consequences of the credit squeeze period was the government starts looking around for other things to export. And they consider different other types of rural exports, manufacturing exports. They also look at the iron ore export embargo and, There's a, there's a big debate about this, some of the departments don't want to get rid of the embargo because they, they still cling to the doctrine that we don't have enough iron ore. But eventually, at the end of 1960, the government relaxes the embargo. This is 3 years after Australia has signed a commerce agreement or trade agreement with Japan, which is a rising industrial power. Now what happens is How this this embargo was lifted came in part from pressure from the West Australian government, and the West Australians, many of them knew that there were large deposits of iron ore elsewhere. In the Pilbara in the remote Pilbara area. And that that getting rid of the embargo could encourage exploration. They also knew of a place on the fringe of the Pilbaram Mount Goldsworthy, which they called tenders for, and that was one of the reasons it puts pressure on Menzies to lift the embargo. After the embargo is lifted, a consortium of companies, American, British and others agreed to build a port, railway and causeway in returning for a mining lease from the state government. That is then legislated by the West Australian parliament. And this provides a template for how mining would be established in West Australia, other mining tenements. Now, a very important prospector for iron ore is this man on the left, Lang Hancock. I don't know if anyone can identify the person on. The right, anyone recognise. Gina, Gina Rinehart was the daughter of Lang Hancock. Lang Hancock was a rural uh uh property owner in the Pilbara. He also was an amateur geologist. He also was one of the pioneers in the 1940s of aerial prospecting. And he tells a story about how in 1952, he's flying across the Pilbara in advance of a storm, he's forced it to fly very low in his plane. And to see in the context of this storm. Sheets of of red water that that indicate to him the presence of iron ore deposits, and he goes back to look at these, this area again. And says this is indeed a large deposit of iron ore. Now this is in the 1950s when there's still an embargo of iron ore, so he can't sell it. He keeps this secret. He can't go to Australian mining companies cos BHP has has got a monopoly of the then iron ore deposits and they're not interested in exploration. They want to keep their monopoly. He does go overseas to the British Rio Tinto Company, and a guy called Save Duncan. Duncan is interested. Duncan sends a geologist over who verifies mammoth deposits. Not exactly where Lang Hancock said they were, but, uh, fairly near to, uh, the, the area delineated by Lang Hancock. The Australian subsidiary of Rio Tinto called Konzinc Rio Tinto, then forms a joint venture with the American Kaiser Steel to to mine these deposits. The West Australian government gives them a lease because they're attracted in part by Rio's sort of promise that they would try to build a steel industry in the west. Now that never happens. Uh, but what the West Australians do get is the beginning of an iron ore rush, or, or a uh uh uh uh. A series of international companies coming to the Pilbara, finding large amounts of high grade iron ore and setting about trying to to mine these areas. So we have in the 1960s. Um, the beginning of an iron ore industry which In the next 60 odd years, becomes one of Australia's richest um export industries. So this is significant in the sense that. We now have the beginnings of mining. Becoming coming to rival agriculture as an export sector. Previously, our exports in the 20th century had been overwhelmingly rural, coming from the land. Now we've got the beginnings of a rich. export industry. Based in Western Australia's remote Pilbara, and Paul Keating, the treasurer, the former treasurer and prime minister of Australia, he remarked, you know, 10 years or so ago that Australia's current wealth, like, In contemporary times, was based on superannuation, compulsory superannuation, and iron ore in the West. So that that is the dimensions of the industry that that begins to develop from 1960. How does it develop Uh, well, firstly you need a market, you need a, a buyer of the iron ore. Now previously Australia really didn't have this because other parts of the world like America had their own iron ore. Britain and and Europe. Uh, had, um, has a, a need for iron ore. But there's a a tremendous distance from Australia to Europe, which means freight costs are high, so that's not a a a ready-made market. Where we do have a market is with Japan. So Japan undergoes a period of, In increasing prosperity after the Second World War, and develops a steel industry, it doesn't have raw materials, it doesn't have good coal, and it needs to, to import iron ore. It um looks at the Australian iron ore and says they're willing to buy it. And not only willing to buy it, but they're willing to make long-term contracts. So that means, Japan would say agree to buy large tonnages over a 15 or 20 year period. And they signed a contract to that effect. This enables the the the the mining companies because they need huge amounts of capital to make this work. They need to build railways in the remote Pilbara. They need to build ports in areas that are prone to cyclone. They need to build townships to house mining uh miners. And governments really don't have both state and federal, don't have the money to provide that capital. So they'd have to get it from financial institutions. So what they do is they take the Japanese contracts to the banks. And use that as collateral to get loans to build the infrastructure. So that's how the. My iron ore industry gets established in the 1960s and 1970s. So it's established from 1960 with the end of the iron ore embargo. By 1973, exporting 500 million, with Japan taking the bulk of these exports. Based in the Pilbara, north west Western Australia. With 4 companies, the major ones, Hammersley, that's Rio Tinto. Goldsworthy, that was the first, it's the uh the smallest of them. Mount Newman is further to the east of the Hammersley Iron deposits, and was mined by an Australian company, Colonial Sugar Refining. Which joined together with an American company called American Metal uh American Climax, and later BHP comes in on that one. So BHP, Having looked at what's happening, decides that really there's a market for an iron ore export industry. And Robe River's the other one. In all this, Charles Court, who was the Minister for Industry in West Australia. And then the premier is especially significant. Anyone heard of Charles Court? His son was also Premier, Richard Court. He's very significant, and the thing we have to remember about mining in the 20th century is the states are very, very important because they control mining leases. And in the case of iron ore, they really were in charge of. Giving leases and providing legislation that set up the companies, um, in the business they were in. And Charles Court incidentally was also very well known to the Japanese, probably a bigger figure in Japan than federal ministers at the time, the 60s and 70s. So iron ore becomes by 2008, Australia's biggest export earner. It's big before that, but it really gets to the top position in the 21st century. The 80s and 90s were harder times for iron ore, but it's still a going concern. And at the time that mining is rising. It's, it's really um a a a a beneficial thing to happen because at the same time as mining is rising, Staples like wool are are declining, so, so wool is declining as a commodity export, going into relative decline. Also manufacturing, so BHP's manufacturing of steel at places like Wollongong and Kembla. Um, also goes into decline. So BHP. Increasingly gets out of the manufacturing business and into the mining business. Now coal is another important development of the 20th century. Now coal of course had been mined from colonial times in New South Wales and to a more limited extent in Queensland. And used for railway transportation, for steel making and electricity generation. But the Australian coal industry, which is, Before the Second World War, based in New South Wales, so that's the, the big black coal mining state. That industry was in a very poor state. It was riven by industrial disputes. There was a big coal strike in 1949, which killed off the Chifley labour government. It was um undercapitalized. Um, and it couldn't make enough coal to export. It only had enough coal for internal use. But The coal industry is resuscitated by government action, so the, the state and federal governments in the 40s, established a joint coal board, so it's an instrumentality. Endowed with federal and state powers, that starts to to revive the industry, to encourage mechanisation, that's another problem, it was not mechanised and therefore not competitive, but the joint coal board encourages mechanisation, better labour relations, etc. and also encourages the state and federal governments to put money into, Building coal infrastructure at ports. Now again, some people thought this was not a good idea because they didn't think we had, we had viable markets. They thought Japan wasn't really gonna be a strong market for Australian coal. The Joint Coal Board convinced the government otherwise and said we can establish a viable market with Japan, put money into developing coal infrastructure at Newcastle. At Port Kembla and Balmain, and also they they added um uh money to the Queensland port of Gladstone as well. So this experiment turns out to be hugely successful. Coal from the, the Wollongong area is, is sold in the late 50s, early 1960s, and then there are big developments of open cut mining in Queensland. This is a uh a map of showing some of the major, Um, cold developments in Queensland. The guy on the left, of course, is, does anyone know who he is? Just go on the left. Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, very famous premier of the 60s, 70s and 1980s. Frank has written about him, in, in his works, including on the 1980s. He was central to one of the central figures to encouraging the development of the coal industry in Queensland. The first company off the blocks here is The Peabody Mitsui, which is a consortium of Australian, The Brothers, an Australian company. The Feast Brothers got going with uh money from America through mutual aid or lend lease. They used that money in the earth moving business, get into mining, encourage uh uh uh a partnership with the American Peabody Coal, and with a Japanese company, Mitsui, to form a consortium. That mines an area of coal discovered in the Bowen Basin. And that becomes uh uh the pioneering Queensland open cut coal company. An even bigger consortium is Utah, an American company that, that, that, that, that overshadows The Peabody Mitsui. Now in contrast to Western Australia. Queen the Queensland state builds the railways. To to get the coal from the, the mines to the port and then to Japan. They build the money and recoup the capital with freight charges. Now this turns out to be extremely lucrative for the state government. As coal prospers, coal is actually a bigger commodity export than iron ore in the 70s and 1980s, so coal overshadows iron ore in the 70s and becomes our largest commodity exporter in the 1980s. Based on Queensland and also New South Wales black coal. Because the state government's getting money from the freight charges, and this enables it, um, amongst other things to get rid of death duty taxes, because it's got this, this lucrative um flow of money coming in. It can abolish death duties, then the other states have to follow suit. So, whether you think that's a good or a bad thing, that's one of the consequences of the Queensland coal boom. So first, coking coal for the manufacture of steel needed for the Japanese steel industry is exported, then thermal coal for the electricity generation from about the mid 70s on. And both states, Queensland and New South Wales, export both types of coal. So thermal coal is used for electricity generation. Which, which generates cheap electricity, which is good for other industries like aluminium, which rely on cheap. Uh, electricity. So the importance of markets to the mining boom is very important. And it There's an indication here of the increasing importance of Asia. As consumers of Australian exports. So the first half of the 20th century, When our export relations were still directed very substantially at the United Kingdom and other European countries and to British Empire countries, and we're selling wool and we're selling wheat, and we're selling other rural commodities. As mining becomes more important, that accentuates the move in the direction of, of the Asia Pacific in our trade relations. So Asian demand first, Japan. Which is very important in the first mining boom and which coincides with the long boom, from 1950 to 1972, and also with later mining booms. Chinese demand becomes, More important in the 21st century after 2001. And this is good for Australia because Australia traditionally had trade deficits with Europe and North America, which it could offset, Um, in the second half of the 20th century, by surpluses with Asian countries. So it's getting more money in its trade from countries like Japan and China because they need our exports. And there are some statistics about the coal rush. So we begin with New South Wales as really the only state exporting coal in the 19 early 1950s and and only a limited amount. By 1965-966, Australia's exporting 7.9 million tonnes and Queensland a lesser amount. Queensland then overtakes New South Wales, and a major change in the pattern of world trade occurs. Which you can see by looking at the fact that in the mid-50s, Japan's taking 83% of coal from the USA, but by 1965, Australia is supplying as much as America. And then by the 1980s, Um, by 1970, we become a major exporter by by ship of coal, and by the 1980s we'd become the largest seaborne exporter of coal. And coal in the 80s is our biggest exporting exportable commodity. Um, there's another pillar of Australian mining, and that's bauxite. Now bauxite is a mineral used for the creation of a light metal called aluminium. And the earliest stage of production of aluminium is alumina, so bauxite alumina aluminium. aluminium is used in a wide variety of. Industrial uses and military uses too became very, a very important strategic commodity in the Second World War. Because of that, the Australian government, which had, Barely any bauxite to speak of that it could use to make aluminium. Decided in the Second World War to create an aluminium industry. Anyone know where the first aluminium industry was? Anyone from Tasmania? At Bell Bay in Tasmania, so using Tasmanian hydroelectricity and imported bauxite to manufacture aluminium. But in the 1950s. At a time when Australia thought it didn't have much bauxite that could be used both to make aluminium and to export to other countries. It um. Experiences great discoveries. One was at Weipa in North Queensland. Uh, where Rio Tinto geologists come across large amounts of bauxite. Another was at Gove in the Northern Territory, where similar large amounts of bauxite are, are identified. And then serendipitously in Western Australia. Which had always known about bauxite in parts of Western Australia, which hitherto had been thought to be unable to make the aluminium. They discovered industrial techniques that they could actually use this bauxite in Western Australia to make aluminium. So really you have, Uh, a remarkable situation where before the late 50s, we have virtually no bauxite to speak of. To becoming by the 1960s, the, the holder of world-class deposits of bauxite that put us up there as one of the top bauxite countries in the world. This leads to. The mining of the bauxite and the export to places like Japan and other countries, but also to the manufacture of alumina and aluminium. So there are industrial spin-offs, there's a big, Um, alumina, um, site was, uh, uh, developed at Gladstone in Queensland, and later aluminium smelters in Victoria, Portland's one of the biggest ones in Australia, and at other places in New South Wales. Incidentally, bauxite mining, one of the other consequences of this was, Um The mining of bauxite at Gove in the Northern Territory took place on Aboriginal land. So on land which had been earmarked as an Aboriginal reserve by the Commonwealth government. And which was the tribal lands of the indigenous inhabitants of that area. That led to a legal challenge against one of the. Northern Territory bauxite Developments, a company called Nabalco. The arguments that were used, legal arguments in this case, We common law native title. Argument, so it was arguing. Against the traditional terra nullius idea that no one owned the land before European settlement to a common law argument. It fails in 1971, in the case of Nabalco, but that argument is used by the same lawyers, a guy called Ron Caston was one of the junior lawyers. He goes on to be the lead lawyer in the Mabo case of 1992. Which convinces the High Court to overturn terra nullius and establish native title in Australian law. So this is a direct consequence, I suppose, this development. Of mining in Australia. Other minerals are also important in the mining boom, one of course is oil. We really had a lot of problems finding oil up until the mid-sixties, but eventually it was discovered in, Fairly considerable amounts in Bass Strait. And that leads to a period of sustainability in oil production in the 1970s. Natural gas is also found in South Australia. And later in greater quantities off the coast of, Western Australia in the northwest shelf. And that becomes in the 1980s, the biggest resource development in Australian history. And other commodities like manganese and nickel and uranium too, so by the 1970s, further discoveries of uranium. Convince Australia that it's one of the biggest um owners of uranium deposits as well as iron ore and coal. So the effects of the first minerals boom from 1960 to 1972, 1 of the effects is that Australia is virtually rediscovered. So If you look at, say, coal in Queensland, Ludwig Leichhardt, the Queensland explorer, knew of coal deposits on his, um, travels around Australia in the 19th century, but people knew they were there. But I suppose what was rediscovered in in the case of Queensland Coal, was that there were markets, there there were consumers, Japan, which would buy the coal, and there were means of financing mines, the railways, the ports, etc. to get, The, the, the coal to its destination. And there were areas uh in the Pilbara that people sort of vaguely knew about that turned out to have some of the richest iron ore deposits in the world. So Australia is virtually rediscovered in the 60s and 1970s. Another consequence in 1964, Donald Horne's famous book The Lucky Country. Predicted in 1964 when it was published, a period of economic decline for Australia. This didn't happen in part because of the massive turnaround in the balance of payments position, because of mining exports. So I remember in the 50s, we had to licence imports. We didn't have enough exports to pay for our our imports. There there's a massive turnaround because we just. Have this bonanza in iron ore exports, coal exports, uh, nickel, uh, copper, manganese, etc. and Bass Strait oil. So there's a great sense of optimism in Australia compared to the UK in the 60s, where there's an uh uh more of a feeling of economic relative decline. Uh, and when in 1967 the British has to devalue the pound sterling, Australia decides, well, we don't have to follow suit because we're in a much more favourable position. Also, our trading patterns are changing because of the mining boom away from the UK and Europe towards Japan and Asia and later China. There's also a loosening of economic ties with Britain. And American capital becomes increasingly important. One other question though is who gets the major benefit. Some Australian companies are benefiting, but foreign ownership is increasing, and there is some disquiet about the levels of foreign ownership in the 60s and 70s. Now there's a, a kind of, the first mining boom comes to a sort of um hiatus in 1973 with the oil price shock when oil prices go up. Because of the actions of OPEC, that's a uh. A consortium of oil producers who managed to hike the price of oil up, that induces a kind of slump in western economies, including Australia, and mining also suffers. Um, But um. Mining goes, there's another more short-lived mining boom from 1976 to 1982. And that's because high oil prices were a two-edged sword because they encouraged a search for oil substitutes. One of the oil substitutes, thermal coal. So that gives a a real fillip to mining of thermal coal, and with the, the greater mining of thermal coal comes um developments in our aluminium industry. So in that period of the resources boom. You have um um an Australian company, CSR, taking over the thermal coal, so there's a bit of an Australianisation of the aluminium industry. Coal ports are further expanded, so putting Newcastle on the road to becoming one of the biggest coal ports in the world. And aluminium gets a boost as well, and in the 80s, the North West Shelf natural gas project gets underway. Then there's another hiatus because there's another slump in 1982. That puts a dampener on economic output in all the western countries, mining goes into a relative period of, Of it's not a boom any anymore, coal is still our biggest export, but there are not boom conditions and prices are relatively lower than they had been. But the biggest boom of them all comes after 2001 with the China boom that really gets going when China joins the World Trade organisation. And embarks on a go global campaign of greater exports. It's also developing considerably its cities and its infrastructure, which needs steel, so which needs more iron ore. The place they get their iron ore from is Australia. Also coal to a more limited extent, aluminium and other. Minerals. So after 1980. China had embraced a kind of managed capitalism, I suppose you could call it that. Um And one of the consequences of its rise after 2001, is that iron ore becomes a major beneficiary. It in 2001, it was essentially a duopoly of the iron ore industry between BHP and Rio Tinto. After the China boom, other players get, get a rise, one is Fortescue Metals, Twiggy Forrest, another Gina Rinehart. She had benefited from her dad getting royalties from his findings of iron ore, and she uses that to leverage a further minerals development in providing iron ore from her own mines to China. The China boom is much larger than the Japan boom, because China's, the the Chinese demand for our minerals was about, like our iron ore was about 7 times as much. As the Japanese demand had been at the height of the first mining boom. So this is an incredible bonanza for Australia that helps governments get revenues from the the taxation, state governments get royalties from from the the the exports going to China. It's a period of um, That contributes to great prosperity in Australia in this period 2001 to about 2013. It also helps Australia to ride out the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2008. So in conclusion, Who benefited in. Australia from the China boom and who didn't. Well, from the latest mining boom, all Australia benefited because the terms of trade or ratio of imports to exports turned in our favour. And Australians became in this period, I'm talking about per capita among the richest in the world. We're still a rich country, but I suppose the boom tapered off about 2013. We weren't getting quite the same prices for iron ore. As in the height of the boom. But iron ore remains today very, very important for Australian budgets and for the taxation revenue, etc. And one of the big worries that governments have now Is if mines in Africa, like in Guinea get going as they are, that will provide China alternative. Sources of its iron ore that mean it doesn't have to rely on Australia so much. Mining exports, this is in all the mining booms, paid dividends to state governments in the form of royalties, particularly good for Queensland and Commonwealth government. Company taxation. Mining companies and their shareholders were big winners out of the mining booms. And One of the things that happened in 2010 was that the Rudd government decided to introduce new taxation to try and tax resources more highly, a super profits tax. It turned out the mining companies, the mining industry was so phenomenally successful as a lobby group that it that it ran a hugely successful campaign that made Rudd withdraw the tax and contributed to his downfall. So the mining company in a sense, was very successful in 2010 in stopping governments taxing it more than they were already. Other losers from the mining booms, arguably the Aboriginal people, But they began to share in mining wealth. More after the Mabo judgments and native title of 1992, and manufacturers also suffered arguably from the high dollar pushed up by mining industries that makes manufacturing less competitive. The Australian people from the mining booms did benefit, we have all benefited from it. But do we get as much benefit from our natural resource wealth as say the Norwegians, now the Norwegians for their oil had a state-owned company which mined the petroleum. And from that mineral wealth, they're not sharing it as much with private companies, they invested that in a sovereign wealth uh sovereign wealth fund. Australia didn't go down that path. So we'll end it there, are there any questions? That people might want to ask. It it would be possible if you could get bipartisanship, like in Norway you had a national consensus. If you had bipartisanship maybe, when you got a situation where one party is saying no, it's like for the recent referendum, it's hard to do it in the face of such a powerful lobby. Um But who knows, maybe when both parties decide they really have to look at tax reform. Maybe mining will be on the agenda. Um, because that's, unless you're increasing consumption taxes and personal taxation on, on us. That's one area Uh, they could be taxed more without too much pain on the mining companies. Uh Yeah. You know, that might be the way to do it because it's like the Keating tax reforms where capital gains taxes were, were, or the GST where GST was used and as uh uh but the, the bargaining leverage was lower income taxes, but that kind of deal might have more chance of success. It's just the nature of our political system just makes it. So hard, maybe if you have more independence having balance of power, that might change things a bit. But we see the the major parties work very, working very hard, both of them, to stop the independence by their electoral laws. Um, yeah. Why does the China. Uh, well, I think. I think mining and capitalism goes in cycles, so that, There's just this historic um boom and bust sort of cycle, it's like the first mining booms end in 1973. I think, The, the, the China mining boom continued because.
