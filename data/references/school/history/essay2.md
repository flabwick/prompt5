This exercise is an in-depth historical study of a focussed topic and period, demonstrating research, writing and analytical skills. It is based on Weeks 1-8. Your answer must demonstrate that you have grappled with the set readings as well as the wider scholarly literature as found in academic journals, scholarly books, and primary source materials from reputable databases. The latter might include Australian Newspapers Online (Trove), Project Gutenberg (e.g. explorers’ journals), digitised records available through the National Archives of Australia (RecordSearch) and the National Library of Australia (Catalogue), and parliamentary debates, papers, votes and proceedings. Essays based on Google keyword searching of non-scholarly sources are likely to result in a Fail grade.

Please look broadly when answering questions to consider the experiences of First Nations people, women and migrants, as well as different Colonies/States and regions.
