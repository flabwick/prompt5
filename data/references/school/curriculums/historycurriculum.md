**Overall Summary**

This curriculum emphasises institutional evolution, domestic and international economic strategy, social planning, and policy implementation. It’s highly conceptual, requires historical contextualisation, and focuses on essay-based analysis rather than technical calculation. Diagrams are interpretive and chronological, not mathematical. Equations are mostly economic logic rather than numerical. Mastery of case-based detail and document interpretation is crucial.
