1. Question
Within the Solow-Swan model, suggest reasons why we do not see convergence across all of the world’s economies.

2. Question
Suppose a country enacts a tax policy that discourages investment: suppose the policy reduces the investment rate immediately and permanently from σ to σ₀ < σ. Assuming the economy starts in its initial steady-state, use the Solow-Swan model to explain what happens to the economy over time and in the long run. Draw a graph showing how output evolves over time (put Ψₜ on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis), and explain what happens to economic growth over time.

3. Question
Consider a one-time change in government policy that immediately and permanently increases the level of the labor force in an economy (such as a more generous immigration policy). In particular, suppose it rises permanently from Λ to Λ₀ > Λ. Assuming the economy starts in its initial steady-state, use the Solow-Swan model to explain what happens to the economy over time and in the long run. In particular, comment on what happens to the level and growth rate of per capita GDP.

4. Question
Consider a Solow model where the production function no longer exhibits diminishing returns to capital accumulation. In particular, assume the production function is now Ψₜ = A·Kₜ. The rest of the model is unchanged.
a) Draw the Solow diagram in this case.
b) Suppose the economy begins with capital K₀ and show how the economy evolves over time in the Solow model.
c) What happens to the growth rate of per capita GDP over time?
