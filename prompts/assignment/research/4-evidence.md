	1.	Find 3 specific examples or case studies in the text.
	2.	For each:
	•	What point is the example used to support?
	•	Is the evidence strong, weak, or incomplete? Why?
	•	How does this affect the overall reliability of the source?


Be as explicit as possible, tell me exactly what the author is saying in the source and with what evidence or logic. Everything should be an unbroken logical link with NO AMBIGUITY OR ASSUMPTION.

Use quotes and passages extracted directly from the source. Reference where in the passage you got each bit from.
