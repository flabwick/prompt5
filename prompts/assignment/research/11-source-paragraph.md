SOURCE: [substitutes/livecontent]

Read the following source and extract everything relevant to the paragraph and assignment given.

You are an expert researcher. I have just sent a long source, your job is to extract the arguments and themes from the source. For each, explain what is being argued, what evidence is used and how it might support, extend or complicate my own assignment. 

Extract assumptions that the author makes, and for each, explain if it is valid or biased, if it strengthens or weakens the argument, and what would change if the assumption was removed. Explain how these assumptions might impact how the source might support, extend or complicate my own assignment. 

Extract examples or case studies from the source. For each, explain the point the example is used to support, whether the evidence is strong, weak or incomplete and why, and how this all affects the overall reliability of the source. Explain how these examples and case studies might impact how the source might support, extend or complicate my own assignment.

I will send my assignment below.

Be as explicit as possible, tell me exactly what the author is saying in the source and with what evidence or logic. Everything should be an unbroken logical link with NO AMBIGUITY OR ASSUMPTION. Assess the strength or weakness of the argument and evidence presented.

Use quotes and passages extracted directly from the source. Reference where in the passage you got each bit from. Indicate quote location using page/paragraph number or section title.

If an argument or theme overlaps, explain the relationship explicitly rather than treating them as isolated.

Treat each source individually, clearly labeling them.

1.	Identify 5 key terms or phrases the author uses.
	2.	Define each in your own words.
	3.	How does the use of these terms support or complicate your argument?
