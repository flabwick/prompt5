SOURCE: [substitutes/livecontent]

Your job is to extract everything from the source above that relates to the paragraph I have written below. The goal is to beef it up with evidence and isnight from the sources.

Be as explicit as possible, tell me exactly what the author is saying in the source and with what evidence or logic. Everything should be an unbroken logical link with NO AMBIGUITY OR ASSUMPTION. Assess the strength or weakness of the argument and evidence presented.

Use quotes and passages extracted directly from the source. Reference where in the passage you got each bit from. Indicate quote location using page/paragraph number or section title.

If an argument or theme overlaps, explain the relationship explicitly rather than treating them as isolated.
