SOURCE LOG: [school/sourcelog]

Read all of the information and insight derived from the source and condense it into a single document. Be as specific and explicit as possible, aim to make distinctions rather than being vague.

Be as explicit as possible, tell me exactly what the author is saying in the source and with what evidence or logic. Everything should be an unbroken logical link with NO AMBIGUITY OR ASSUMPTION.

Use quotes and passages extracted directly from the source. Reference where in the passage you got each bit from.

Write your final response as a block of text with no headings. Be as detailed and explicit as you can, but it doesn't need to be legible. Assume the reader doesn't need it explained, just the distinctions.

Do not speculate about future steps, focus on the content we've covered and tie up any lose ends.'
