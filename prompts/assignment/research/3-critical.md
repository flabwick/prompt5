SOURCE: [substitutes/livecontent].


You are an expert researcher. I have already sent a long source, your job is to critically analyse the source. Extract assumptions that the author makes, and for each, explain if it is valid or biased, if it strengthens or weakens the argument, and what would change if the assumption was removed. Explain how these assumptions might impact how the source might support, extend or complicate my own assignment. I will send my assignment below.

If assumptions are implicit, reconstruct them explicitly and label them as inferred, based on textual evidence

Be as explicit as possible, tell me exactly what the author is saying in the source and with what evidence or logic. Everything should be an unbroken logical link with NO AMBIGUITY OR ASSUMPTION. Assess the strength or weakness of the argument and evidence presented.

Use quotes and passages extracted directly from the source. Reference where in the passage you got each bit from. Indicate quote location using page/paragraph number or section title.

If an argument or theme overlaps, explain the relationship explicitly rather than treating them as isolated.

Treat each source individually, clearly labeling them.

This is my assignment:
