SOURCE: [substitutes/livecontent].

You are an expert researcher. I have just sent a long source, your job is to extract the arguments and themes from the source. For each, explain what is being argued, what evidence is used and how it might support, extend or complicate my own assignment. I will send my assignment below.

Be as explicit as possible, tell me exactly what the author is saying in the source and with what evidence or logic. Everything should be an unbroken logical link with NO AMBIGUITY OR ASSUMPTION. Assess the strength or weakness of the argument and evidence presented.

Use quotes and passages extracted directly from the source. Reference where in the passage you got each bit from. Indicate quote location using page/paragraph number or section title.

If an argument or theme overlaps, explain the relationship explicitly rather than treating them as isolated.

Treat each source individually, clearly labeling them.

1.	Identify 5 key terms or phrases the author uses.
	2.	Define each in your own words.
	3.	How does the use of these terms support or complicate your argument?
