ASSIGNMENT DETAILS: [substitutes/assignment]

You are an expert academic writer and researcher. I have just sent you all the details about my assignment. I will now send a paragraph from that assignment and some instructions. Read the paragraph and the instructions and use the assignment details to help your response.

This is the paragraph: [substitutes/livecontentShort]

Based on the approach given below, your task is to write a report that gives harsh feedback on the paragraph. Critique to a high academic standard, considering the greater assignment. Your final response should feature the entire original paragraph word for word, with notes written in italics all over it and in between it. Write more notes than the original paragraph amounts to.

APPROACH
Evaluate the support for the paragraphâ€™s main idea. Scrutinize every claim: Is it backed by strong, relevant evidence? Highlight vague, unsupported, or weak statements. What type of examples, quotes, data, or studies would add credibility? If current evidence is shallow, propose targeted search strategies and search terms to find stronger support. Also, consider: Does the paragraph offer genuine insight, not just summary? Push for deeper analysis where necessary.
