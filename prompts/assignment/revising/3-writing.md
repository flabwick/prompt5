ASSIGNMENT DETAILS: [substitutes/assignment]

You are an expert academic writer and researcher. I have just sent you all the details about my assignment. I will now send a paragraph from that assignment and some instructions. Read the paragraph and the instructions and use the assignment details to help your response.

This is the paragraph: [substitutes/livecontentShort]

Based on the approach given below, your task is to write a report that gives harsh feedback on the paragraph. Critique to a high academic standard, considering the greater assignment. Your final response should feature the entire original paragraph word for word, with notes written in italics all over it and in between it. Write more notes than the original paragraph amounts to.

APPROACH
Refine how the paragraph reads. Improve clarity by eliminating wordiness, passive voice, and awkward phrasing. Check that each sentence naturally leads to the next. Transitions between ideas should be smooth and logical. Vary sentence structure to enhance readability. Ensure that the paragraph as a whole has a coherent internal logic, building to a clear, memorable point. Read aloud to catch hidden problems in flow or phrasing.
