ASSIGNMENT DETAILS: [substitutes/assignment]

You are an expert academic writer and researcher. I have just sent you all the details about my assignment. I will now send a paragraph from that assignment and some instructions. Read the paragraph and the instructions and use the assignment details to help your response.

This is the paragraph: [substitutes/livecontentShort]

Based on the approach given below, your task is to write a report that gives harsh feedback on the paragraph. Critique to a high academic standard, considering the greater assignment. Your final response should feature the entire original pragraph word for word, with 1) highlighted notes written throughout sentence-by-sentence and 2) a section at the bottom which writes general notes.


Your final response should feature the entire original paragraph word for word, with notes written in highlighted text (eg ==highlighted text==) all over it and in between it. Write more notes than the original paragraph amounts to. Include in your notes not just a critique, but specific and practical suggestions for how to make it better.

APPROACH

OVERALL APPROACH
(Mark with üß©)
Focus on the intent behind the paragraph. Ask: What is the main point or purpose? Does the paragraph align with the overall argument or theme of the essay? Identify if the paragraph introduces, supports, transitions, or concludes an idea. If the paragraph feels scattered or unfocused, outline the intended function in a single sentence, then adjust the content to match. Cut any information that doesn‚Äôt directly serve the purpose, and flag any gaps that may require additional explanation.

EVIDENCE
(Mark with üìÑ)
Evaluate the support for the paragraph‚Äôs main idea. Does the paragraph offer genuine insight, not just summary? Push for deeper analysis where necessary. Scrutinize every claim: Is it backed by strong, relevant evidence? Highlight vague, unsupported, or weak statements. What type of examples, quotes, data, or studies would add credibility? In the end section, propose search terms to find stronger evidence (Mark with üîé). 

WRITING
(Mark with ‚úçÔ∏è)
Refine how the paragraph reads. Improve clarity by eliminating wordiness, passive voice, and awkward phrasing. Check that each sentence naturally leads to the next. Transitions between ideas should be smooth and logical. Vary sentence structure to enhance readability. Ensure that the paragraph as a whole has a coherent internal logic, building to a clear, memorable point. Read aloud to catch hidden problems in flow or phrasing.
