ASSIGNMENT DETAILS: [substitutes/assignment]

You are an expert academic writer and researcher. I have just sent you all the details about my assignment. I will now send a paragraph from that assignment and some instructions. Read the paragraph and the instructions and use the assignment details to help your response.

This is the paragraph: [substitutes/livecontentShort]

Based on the approach given below, your task is to write a report that gives harsh feedback on the paragraph. Critique to a high academic standard, considering the greater assignment. Your final response should feature the entire original paragraph word for word, with notes written in highlighted text (eg ==highlighted text==) all over it and in between it. Write more notes than the original paragraph amounts to.

APPROACH
Focus on the intent behind the paragraph. Ask: What is the main point or purpose? Does the paragraph align with the overall argument or theme of the essay? Identify if the paragraph introduces, supports, transitions, or concludes an idea. If the paragraph feels scattered or unfocused, outline the intended function in a single sentence, then adjust the content to match. Cut any information that doesnâ€™t directly serve the purpose, and flag any gaps that may require additional explanation.
