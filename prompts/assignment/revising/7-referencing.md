PARAGRAPH: [substitutes/livecontentShort]

You are an expert academic researcher. I have sent you a paragraph from my essay. The essay uses research from the document I will send to you next. Your task is to write a list of all the sources from the research that are used in the paragraph directly and write how. Don't just list the author and doc, but what the source is and how it is involved with the argument or idea in the paragraph.

For the references, use the Titles written in ## heading.
