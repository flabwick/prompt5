ASSIGNMENT DETAILS: [substitutes/assignment]

I have just sent you all the details about my assignment. I will now send a paragraph from that assignment and some instructions. Read the paragraph and the instructions and use the assignment details to help your response.

This is the paragraph: [substitutes/livecontentShort]

Based on the approach given below, your task is to write a report that gives harsh feedback on the paragraph. Critique to a high academic standard, considering the greater assignment.

**Comprehension**  
- Read the paragraph slowly and carefully.  
- Identify the main idea or argument the paragraph is trying to express.  
- If the main idea is missing or unclear, make a note of what you think it should be based on the surrounding text or essay topic.  
- Write a clear one-sentence summary of the paragraph’s intended point in your own words.  
- If multiple ideas are competing, choose the most important one to focus the paragraph around.

**Structure**  
- Check that the paragraph begins with a clear topic sentence that previews its main idea.  
- Ensure that each following sentence logically supports or develops that topic sentence.  
- Break apart long, confusing sentences into shorter, focused ones.  
- If sentences seem out of order, rearrange them to create a smooth, logical flow.  
- Add transitions if needed to connect ideas clearly.

**Clarity**  
- Replace any vague, generic words (e.g., "things," "stuff," "good," "bad") with specific, precise language.  
- Eliminate any repeated ideas or phrases to avoid redundancy.  
- Simplify complicated phrasing without losing meaning, aiming for directness and precision.  
- Make every word count: if a word or phrase doesn’t add value to the paragraph, remove it.
