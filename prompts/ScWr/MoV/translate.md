Write a scene in a screenplay that will fit into my screenplay inspired by the Shakespeare scene above.

consider, do people actually talk like this? Write your response like a screenplay that's more realistic rather than a theatrical play.

Don't just translate word for word everything, but get the themes and the tone right.

Do everything over to the tone and setting of my screenplay, this is an adaptation.
