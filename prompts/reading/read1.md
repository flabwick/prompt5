Extract value and compelling stories and insight directly from the passage. Then, condense them and write a short response which shows the article's value. Break this response into units of insight and format visually so I can see the ideas and how they relate to each other. Note striking facts, unexpected claims and unique perspectives. Trust your readerâ€™s interpretation, allowing them space to engage with the content naturally, free of unnecessary explanation or filler. Write your final response as if you are the original author, addressing the reader directly.
