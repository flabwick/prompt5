**PLAN**  
SPEC: [substitutes/coding/spec]  
MODULE: [substitutes/coding/module]  

Something has gone wrong while working on the module specified above. Your job is to respond with a full debugging plan for how to fix everything.

Separate all the problems into standalone ISSUES. For each, think deeply about how to approach debugging it and produce an entry:  
1) What information you need to understand and isolate the issue fully. Which files you need to read and what parts.  
2) A series of potential fixes. Note the scenario in which each fix is applicable. Exhaust the simplest, most obvious fixes first before recommending complex fixes with added functionality. Create backup plan after backup plan.
