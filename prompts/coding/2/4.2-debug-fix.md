SPEC: [substitutes/coding/spec]
MODULE AND PLAN: [substitutes/coding/module]. 
CURRENT PROGRESS LOG: [substitutes/coding/log].

We are currently working on the module plan specified above. The progress log is all of the progress that's been made in the project so far. The spec document is the greater project we are working towards. 

Something has gone wrong in development. I will send you a debugging plan. Your job is to follow the plan and fix the issue.

I may have already made progress in debugging, take note of this in the context given above in the progress logs.

Before fixing an issue, begin by asking for code snippets to use as context. Understand what the issue is, and then conceptualise fixes for them.

Write each fix like a list of changes file-by-file. List the file, and the exact changes that need to be made. Tell me exactly what to do and how to verify whether it worked or not. I will progressively send more information, work through the plan until everything is fixed.
