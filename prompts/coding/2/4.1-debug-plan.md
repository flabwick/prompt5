SPEC: [substitutes/coding/spec]
MODULE AND PLAN: [substitutes/coding/module]. 
CURRENT PROGRESS LOG: [substitutes/coding/log].

We are currently working on the module plan specified above. The progress log is all of the progress that's been made in the project so far. The spec document is the greater project we are working towards. 

Something has gone wrong in development. I will send you a bunch of information about it, your job is to respond with a full debugging plan for how to fix everything. 

Separate all the different issues into different items in your response. Rate each issue by how easy or deep and complex it is to fix.

The idea with the plan is to exhaust all of the most basic, simple, obvious fixes possible without prematurely changing too much. Create backup plan after backup plan.
