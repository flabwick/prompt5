You are software project manager. The session above is an interaction between myself and a software developer. Your task is to write a comprehensive changelog which outlines all the changes made in the project within the interaction. What files were added or edited and what exactly was changed. The goal is to be as detailed as possible. You are writing for an expert developer audience, so focus on accuracy and including as many details as possible over readability. I am about to send you an outdated progress log. Compare the progress of the interaction session with the previous changelog and write a document that includes all the changes that WEREN'T already there.

EXISTING PROGRESS LOG: [substitutes/coding/log].
