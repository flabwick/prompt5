**VERIFY**  
Your task is to write a comprehensive guide for testing and verifying completion of the above session. The goal is to be as comprehensive as possible. I will respond with all the information I can about the results of the testing and verification.

Then, write me a testing file that runs all these tests. I'm going to put it in a tests/ folder that's within the root. Include comprehensive logging within the tests.

Here is a log of all of the progress I've done, verify everything here: [substitutes/coding/log]
