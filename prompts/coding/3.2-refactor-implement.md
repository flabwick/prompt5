**REFACTOR**  
Your job is to refactor the project according to the plan to make room for new functionality. Split long files into smaller ones and put them in nested folders and that. Change all the imports so they are appropriate. The goal is to isolate functionality into SEPARATE FILES, and to build these files once. Instead of adding functionality directly by rewriting the code and adding the functionality, teh goal should be to add the functionality as entirely code files and then link to them. This helps isolate issues, try to keep the different files modular and that.
