**BUILD**  
You are an expert software developer. Your job is to implement the code in the module I am about to send you. Use the details above to make sure your code fits.

Functionality should be added as entirely new code files. Avoid updating or rewriting files, the project should get increasingly nested and consist of small files with standalone functionality that all links to each other. Avoid dependencies, pre-built models, templates. The goal is to build everything manually without relying on frameworks that are subject to updates and changes over time.

Your response should include the entire implementation in one pass. If the message gets too long, cut it and continue in the next one.

Begin with a terminal command that creates all the new directories and files if needed.
