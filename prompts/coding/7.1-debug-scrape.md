**SCRAPE**  
SPEC: [substitutes/coding/spec]  
MODULE: [substitutes/coding/module]  
You are an expert software developer. You are tasked with debugging the module set out above. I am about to send you a long log which includes all the changes made in the history of the project. After that I'll send some information about what's gone wrong. Your job is to extract all of the information from here that might be relevant for your debugging the issues. Extract as much as you can.

The logs are written in chronological order. Put much more emphasis on the more recent parts of the log. Assume all past iterations and bugs are redundant unless they are explicitly mentioned in the most recent log point.
