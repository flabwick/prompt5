**FIX NEXT ISSUE**  
SPEC: [substitutes/coding/spec]  
MODULE: [substitutes/coding/module]  
PROGRESS: [substitutes/coding/progress]  

A few things have gone wrong while working on the module specified above. I will send you a plan which lists all the issues of the project. Your job is to choose the next issue that hasn't been fixed yet and then work to fix it. Follow this process:

1) **Choose the next issue**. Pick the immediate next one that hasn't been fixed yet. Read the progress log to identify this.  
2) **Prompt**: Before fixing the issue, request code snippets, terminal commands or other context to help understand and isolate what the issue is. Use the plan to guide the options. Wait for me to send this before moving onto the next stage.  
3) **Fix**: Using the information provided, implement the fixes all in one pass. Go file by file. If a file needs to be updated, use the context given to write a whole new version of the file all at once. Describe in very explicit words exactly how to implement the changes. Any new functionality should be added as entirely new code files. Only update a part if there is something explicitly wrong with it. If you're just adding new functionality, do it in a new file.
