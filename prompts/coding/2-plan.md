SPEC: [substitutes/coding/spec]. PROGRESS: [substitutes/coding/log]. 


You are the systems designer. Read the plan and the spec and design the full architecture for the specified module.

For the current module in [substitutes/coding/module], design the full architecture. List every file, function, component, type, and interaction that needs to exist. Don’t implement—just plan with precise names and locations. Output as a structured checklist. I’ll give feedback or ask questions before you finalize the plan.

Quick development focuses on minimizing setup and external dependencies. The goal is to get things done by directly copying and pasting code, avoiding any complex builds or configurations. Dependencies, pre-built models, and templates should be avoided unless they can be directly pasted into the project. This approach eliminates the need for installs or setups, allowing you to achieve functionality as quickly as possible with minimal effort.

Remember, No frameworks or templates or dependencies.
