SOURCE MATERIAL: [substitutes/livecontent]


Analyze the source material and extract curriculum units based strictly on its content. Respond with a long and dense document in the chat that just lists all this out in as explicit detail as possible. It doesn't need to be readable, just completely accurate. your final response should be around 1000 words.

DO NOT CREATE A SPREADSHEET OR CODE FILE, JUST WRITE IN THE CHAT.

üéØ Your Goal

Write a digestible, structured curriculum summary document for your tutor that answers:
	1.	What content to learn (and not to learn)
	2.	What level/methods to use
	3.	What types of exam questions appear
	4.	What equations to know
	5.	What diagrams to master (and how)

üß† Your General Approach (Step-by-Step)

1. Skim ‚Üí Chunk ‚Üí Summarise

You‚Äôre not just copying stuff over ‚Äî you‚Äôre distilling it. Treat each source like something to skim first, then chunk into logical units, then summarise per unit.

Do this per week/module/theme. Use headings like:
	‚Ä¢	Topic title
	‚Ä¢	What to learn
	‚Ä¢	Not in scope
	‚Ä¢	Methods/tools used
	‚Ä¢	Exam-style questions
	‚Ä¢	Equations to know
	‚Ä¢	Diagrams to master

2. Extract from Lecture Transcripts

These are your gold mine for what‚Äôs expected.
	‚Ä¢	Skim the transcript for topic changes. Make headings for each topic.
	‚Ä¢	Look for:
	‚Ä¢	Learning objectives ‚Äì sometimes stated explicitly
	‚Ä¢	Examples worked out in full
	‚Ä¢	Conceptual definitions and context explanations
	‚Ä¢	Anything repeated or emphasized (that‚Äôs likely examinable)
	‚Ä¢	Highlight:
	‚Ä¢	Any limits of coverage (‚Äúwe won‚Äôt cover XYZ‚Äù or ‚Äúin more advanced classes you‚Äôll see‚Ä¶‚Äù)
‚∏ª

1. Use Problem Sets to Identify Skill Level

This tells your tutor the level and format you‚Äôre expected to perform at.
	‚Ä¢	For each set:
	‚Ä¢	List the types of questions (calculation, theory, graph analysis, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Identify recurring question formats (MCQs, essays, short answers, math-based problems?)
	‚Ä¢	Pull out what techniques are being tested
	‚Ä¢	Note if any assumptions or simplifications are commonly made


‚∏ª

1. Extract From Textbooks Only What‚Äôs Covered

These go deeper than needed. Your job is to map which parts actually match your course.
	‚Ä¢	Use your transcript as a reference: if your lecture covered ‚ÄúElasticity,‚Äù only summarise the matching chapter section.
	‚Ä¢	Ignore side boxes, deep dives, or ‚Äúbeyond the scope‚Äù materials unless referenced in class.
	‚Ä¢	Look for key equations and standard graphs.


‚∏ª

1. Be Hyper-Specific About Graphs and Diagrams

Tutors often assume too much here. Be brutally clear about:
	‚Ä¢	Which diagrams are required (e.g., supply and demand, Phillips curve, Lorenz curve)
	‚Ä¢	What you need to do with them:
	‚Ä¢	Draw from scratch
	‚Ä¢	Label accurately
	‚Ä¢	Interpret given graphs
	‚Ä¢	Explain shifts or movements
