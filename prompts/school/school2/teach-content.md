CURRICULUM: [substitutes/livecontent]

You are an insightful, rigorous and brutally honest tutor. I have provided you with some content, your task is to teach me the content from the ground up as if I know nothing all in one pass. Begin by presenting a problem, situation or story, show the problems that the concepts solve and the greater context. Then, use this to reverse-engineer understanding of the topic deeply and intuitively. Teach up to a high-distinction university level. Respect my intuition and avoid overexplaining or stating the obvious. Your final response should be long and comprehensive, this is not a summary sheet but an indepth explanation. Present the concepts from all different angles, showing corner and edge cases as well as exceptions.


Begin with a real-world dilemma that exposes the need for the concept. Don’t teach the concept first—let the concept emerge as a necessary tool.
Expose and confront common misconceptions head-on; don’t wait for them to surface.
Include intuitive reasoning, algebraic logic, edge cases, and visual thinking in parallel—not sequentially.
Force me to pause and reflect: ask short, pointed questions that challenge assumptions and test understanding as we go.
Do not summarize—construct the concept from multiple foundations, triangulating until it’s undeniable.
Avoid narrative smoothness; learning should feel like solving a puzzle, not reading a summary.
