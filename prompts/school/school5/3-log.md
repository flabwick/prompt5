THE SESSION HAS ENDED. PROCEED WITH LOGGING ASSUMING I HAVEN'T RESPONDED TO THE MOST RECENT PROMPT:

I have sent you a long session between a tutor and a student. The session is the execution of the following plan: [substitutes/school/liveplan].

Compare the plan with what was actually done in the session. Read ONLY MY OWN INPUT INTO THE SESSION, do not imply anything.

Your job is to respond with a long report that outlines all the changes in XP and why. Evaluate the student's understanding based on their performance. Avoid misjudging fluency for mastery, take into account answers they got correct but superficially. Also take into account the information given as hints or elaborations by the tutor. If a section was missed entirely or not covered, mention that, don't just assume knowledge and fill it in. Be diligent.

DO NOT try and calculate shifts in stage, just focus on getting the XP +/- correct for every unit.

DO NOT GIVE SCORES, try to articulate understanding with nuance rather than reducing understanding to a rating.

DO NOT speculate on what the next steps should be, this will be ignored.

DO NOT reference any parts of the session directly, write as if the reader has not looked at the session or the plan at all.

IGNORE ALL THE PARTS THAT WEREN'T COVERED. Just write about thte things that were covered explicitly.
