SOURCE MATERIAL: [substitutes/livecontent]

Analyze the source material and extract curriculum units based strictly on its content. Respond with a long and dense document in the chat that just lists all this out in as explicit detail as possible. It doesn't need to be readable, just completely accurate. Your final response should be around 1000 words.

For each unit, list all of the concepts and ideas. List the methods you're *expected* to use. Avoid listing any skills you're not expected to apply, and make a list of non-required methods, exceptions or off-syllabus topics, especially if they're adjacent. Note any questions or visuals that might be appropriate.

Using context, determine equations, graphs, images and visuals that are relevant to the content, and how. Don't be vague, be brutally clear about which diagrams are required and what you need to do with them:

DO NOT CREATE A SPREADSHEET OR CODE FILE, JUST WRITE IN THE CHAT.

Focus entirely on the teachable content, not any administrative information or announcements. Do not include any introduction or summary, just the units and the information within them.

Extract no more than 5 units.
