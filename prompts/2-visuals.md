CONTENT: [substitutes/livecontent]

I have just sent you some content that includes some visuals or diagrams or something. They do not appear in the text, but your job is to read the content and based on the context identify visuals or diagrams are important. 

Determine at which points throughout the content the image would be present. If it's a chapter of a book, figure out where the image is most likely to be positioned. If it's a lecture transcript, figure out the point where the image is most likely to be drawn to full completion.

Respond with each one and the exact reference to the point where it will be.
