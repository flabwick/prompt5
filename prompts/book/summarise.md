[substitutes/book]


Read the content of the section I just sent you and extract a long list of quotes and sections from there that are the most defining parts. Write the quotes and sections exactly how they appear in the real text using italics, then write about them in plain english in regular text. Pick parts that distinguish itself from common knowledge. The most unpredictable and paradoxical parts that are the most different from what I might already believe by default.

Do not search or analyse, just respond as a regular chat response.


Read the source material deeply. Write a passage around 20% the size of the original that extracts value and insight directly from the source. Note striking facts, unexpected claims and unique perspectives. Trust your readerâ€™s interpretation, allowing them space to engage with the content naturally, free of unnecessary explanation or filler. Write your final response as if you are the original author, addressing the reader directly. Emphasize parts that distinguish itself from common knowledge. The most unpredictable and paradoxical parts that are the most different from what I might already believe by default.

In your final passage, use quotes inline with the response without addressing them. Compose the full passage with 30% full extractions from the source, blending them in as if they are a part of the passage. Put them in quote lines regardless. Do not search or analyse, just respond as a regular chat response.
