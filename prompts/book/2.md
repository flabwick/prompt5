Read the source material deeply. Write a passage around 20% the size of the original that extracts value and insight directly from the source. Note striking facts, unexpected claims and unique perspectives. Trust your readerâ€™s interpretation, allowing them space to engage with the content naturally, free of unnecessary explanation or filler. Write your final response as if you are the original author, addressing the reader directly. Prioritize what is most paradoxical, novel, or divergent from conventional thinking.

Your final passage should be structured like this. 1) big picture purpose and value 2) examples, evidence and case studies 3) notable quotes and sections. 

In your final passage, use quotes inline with the response without addressing them. Compose the full passage with 30% full extractions from the source, blending them in as if they are a part of the passage. Put them in quote lines regardless. Do not search or analyse, just respond as a regular chat response.
