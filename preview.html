<p><strong>Likely Exam Question Types: Natural Monopoly &amp; Regulation</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>1. Diagram-Based Analysis</strong></p>
<p><em>“Draw a cost diagram of a natural monopoly. Indicate MC, ATC, and demand. Show the socially efficient output and the monopoly output. Shade the deadweight loss.”</em></p>
<p>→ You must:
- Accurately label MC, downward-sloping ATC, demand, MR
- Show monopoly output: MR = MC → price from D
- Show efficient output: P = MC → Q<em>
- Shade DWL triangle between Qm and Q</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>2. Regulation Trade-off</strong></p>
<p><em>“Explain, with diagrams, the implications of imposing a price ceiling at marginal cost in a natural monopoly. Discuss whether this outcome is sustainable.”</em></p>
<p>→ Expect to:
- Draw price ceiling at MC
- Show zero/negative profit if P &lt; ATC
- Explain firm exit risk
- Possibly calculate required subsidy:<br/>
  ( \text{Subsidy} = (\text{ATC} - \text{MC}) \times Q^* )</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>3. Numerical Application</strong></p>
<p><em>“A firm has FC = 1000, VC = 2Q. Demand: P = 10 – 0.5Q.<br/>
Find: a) Monopoly Q, P, profit<br/>
  b) Efficient Q, P<br/>
  c) Size of subsidy required to induce Q</em>.”*</p>
<p>→ You must:
- Set MR = MC to find monopoly Q
- Use P(Q), ATC(Q) to compute profit
- For P = MC, solve for Q<em>
- Find difference between ATC and MC at Q</em>
- Multiply difference by Q* to get total subsidy</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>4. Argumentative / Conceptual</strong></p>
<p><em>“Why does a natural monopoly justify government intervention? Explain using cost structure and efficiency criteria.”</em></p>
<p>→ Requires:
- Define natural monopoly
- Show conflict between cost efficiency and pricing efficiency
- Discuss DWL, firm losses, and subsidy logic
- Reference trade-offs: allocative efficiency vs. fiscal cost</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>5. Compare Scenarios</strong></p>
<p><em>“Compare outcomes under:<br/>
a) Monopoly without regulation<br/>
b) Price ceiling at P = MC<br/>
c) Price ceiling at P = ATC<br/>
Use diagrams and explain efficiency and sustainability in each.”</em></p>
<p>→ Structure matters:
- Draw each case cleanly
- Identify CS, PS, DWL
- Discuss: which is efficient, which is sustainable, which needs subsidy</p>
